A derivative expansion of the effective average action beyond first order yields renormalization
group functional flow equations which are used for the computation of critical exponents of the
Ising universality class. The critical exponent  in  is consistent with high-precision methods.

The effective average action 

The effective average action  ( see and ) is a functional of the fields
. It interpolates between the classical action  at some microscopic ultraviolet scale
 and the effective action : , .
Its dependence on the momentum scale  is described by an exact renormalization group
functional flow equation:



where  is the second functional derivative of  with respect to the
fields and  denotes a momentum cutoff function with the properties ,
 and  ensuring the above limit
properties of . Universal properties of the renormalization group flow, however, are
independent of the actual choice of .

The flow of  and higher n-point-functions can be derived from the flow of
 by functional derivation, e.g.

 



where the flow of  would involve  and  and so on.
In order to end up with a closed system of functional flow equations one needs to do a finite
truncation of .

In the following we concentrate on a one-component real scalar field 
. There are the invariants  and
 featuring the  symmetry of
the Ising universality class. Here the lowest order truncation of the effective average action
reads



in terms of the effective average potential  and a field independent
wave function renormalization . The effective average propagator



gives the flow of the effective average potential



and  can be determined from .





Derivative expansion beyond first order 

In a second order derivative expansion of the effective average action there are
contributions from up to four nonvanishing momenta. These are parametrized by the
effective average potential and one respectively three linearly independent wave
function renormalizations in first respectively second order:











This truncation has been the starting point for a recent investigation in. There an additional field expansion of the potential and 
the wave function renormalizations in powers of  is done. Here we keep the full field dependence but instead go 
only one step beyond first order and take only ,  and  into account due to the following reasoning:

While  and  directly contribute to  and thus enter all flow 
equations as  and  terms in the denominators of the integrands,  and 
only give additive contributions to the four-point-vertex and the three-point-vertex respectively. 
Also, their flow requires  and . 
This is why we neglect  and  in this paper which corresponds to a truncation 
beyond first and below second order.

We hope that this improves the critical exponent  compared to first order calculations.
On the other hand, the anomalous dimension  is related to the momentum dependence of the
wave function renormalization and will probably suffer from the missing contributions.

Substituting ,  and  the 
truncation thus reads:







and the next step is to derive ,  and :





Renormalization group flow equations 

Expanding the fields  in small fluctuations
 in momentum space around a constant background 
 yields the n-point-functions
:




















These are inserted into









and yield the flow equations







In order to be able to perform the -derivatives one has to expand the denominator
containing . Let  and :



Then the mixed scalar products  can also be eliminated:





 for all odd 

This finally gives the explicit flow equations:















Scale invariant flow equations 

As we are interested in critical phenomena of second order phase transitions 
corresponding to fix points in the renormalization group flow, we write the
flow equations in explicitely scale invariant form.

To this end one substitutes  ( where
 is the running minimum of  ), ,
, ,  etc.
such that









































where for abbreviation we have used the constants















and the momentum integrals









which will be discussed next:




Momentum integrals 

The momentum integrals ,  and  can be computed efficiently in case of 
a linear cutoff. For the choice  one has









and ,  and  are reduced to a single integral :









where  is a special case of a hypergeometric function















with , ,  and 
. The series expansion and reordering is valid and convergent as long as
 for . Which is the case, as the effective average propagator stays finite at all times.




Critical exponents 

Starting with a quartic potential  
the flow equations are discretized on a grid and numerically solved for different values of 
. During the evolution towards , the running minimum of the
potential (  ) may either end up in the massless spontaneously broken phase 
( ,  ) or in the massive symmetric phase ( ,  ). 
The critical  leads to a second order phase transition characterized by fix points 
of all couplings and vanishing masses. Fine tuning  around  then
yields the critical exponent  through the scaling law 
and the established proportionality .
The critical exponent  may be identified with the fix point  of the anomalous 
dimension. 

The critical exponents for the universality class of the three dimensional Ising model
obtained in this way are compared in Table 1 to values obtained in first order (  )
and lowest order ( ,  ). For comparison we also give results from literature. 
An extensive review of different techniques and recent results can be found in.
We adopt their overall estimates of exponents and errors. In addition we quote some of the 
newest and precisest results from high temperature expansions, perturbation series at fixed 
dimension, -expansions and Monte Carlo simulations plus some additional references.

Conclusion and outlook 

The critical exponent  has significantly improved compared to 
first order. This is the first calculation using a linear cutoff that is consistent with
high precision methods. On the other hand, the anomalous dimension is sensitive to the 
neglected contributions as can be seen in comparison to.
Its error has even increased in comparison to first order. 

Hence the inclusion of the neglected wave function renormalizations should be the next step.
