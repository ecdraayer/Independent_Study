We consider warped compactifications that solve the 10 dimensional
supergravity equations of motion at a point, stabilize the position of
a D3-brane world, and admit a warp factor that violates Lorentz invariance
along the brane.  This gives a 
string embedding of "asymmetrically warped" models which we use to calculate
stringy () corrections to standard model dispersion relations, paying
attention to the maximum speeds for different particles.  We find, from
the dispersion relations, limits on gravitational Lorentz violation in these
models, improving on current limits on the speed of graviton propagation,
including those derived from field theoretic loops.
We comment on the viability of models that use asymmetric warping for
self-tuning of the brane cosmological constant.

Introduction 
Violation of Lorentz invariance is of great interest in the field of quantum
gravity since it can arise in many different ways.  
For example, canonical quantum gravity has been argued to predict 
Planck scale Lorentz violation,
and noncommutative space-time coordinates break Lorentz invariance
.  Lorentz violation has also been related to 
variation of coupling constants.
The literature is
very broad, and we refer the reader to for a review
of several developments.

In this paper, we consider a form of Lorentz violation that can appear 
in braneworld compactifications of string theory, which is known as
asymmetric warping.  In braneworld compactifications, the spacetime manifold
need not be a direct product of noncompact and compact submanifolds; the
noncompact spacetime metric usually has a warp factor dependent on the 
internal space (see for
early work on warping and a review).  However, nothing in the higher 
dimensional theory keeps the warp factors of the different noncompact 
dimensions the same, as first discussed in.  
The metric takes the form 
metric 
ds^2 = -e^A(y)  dt^2 +e^B(y)  dx^2 + g_mn (y) dy^m dy^n .
A nice
feature of this form of Lorentz violation is that it is classically confined
to the gravitational sector (the graviton moves at a different speed than
light); if the brane stays at a fixed position in the
extra dimensions, we can rescale the noncompact coordinates and recover
an  symmetry for fields confined to the brane, including the
standard model (in most braneworlds).  These models therefore avoid, at tree
level, the rather stringent limits on Lorentz violation in the standard model 
(see for a recent review and s:limits  for
a brief discussion of the experimental bounds).  

Despite the classical restriction of Lorentz violation to gravity, we 
expect that a symmetry broken anywhere is broken everywhere.  Indeed, 
the communication of Lorentz violation from gravity to the standard model
by quantum loops was studied in in a rather general
framework.  Limits on Lorentz violation in the standard model are thus 
related to limits on asymmetric warping, which quoted
in terms of the difference of graviton and photon speeds.  Evading limits
such as these is a new problem for extra-dimensional cosmology, similar
to the original flatness problem that was solved by inflation 
.

In parallel with, we consider the communication of 
Lorentz violation from gravity to the standard model sector in a string
theoretical background, which we describe in section .  
Instead of loop corrections, we consider  corrections to the D3-brane
action, which are at tree level in string perturbation theory.  Since
the worldsheet disk fluctuates in the dimensions orthogonal to the D-brane,
these terms are sensitive to the Lorentz violating derivatives of the metric.
(Using stringy corrections has the slight advantage over loops that we do
not have to worry about how to regulate perturbative gravity.)  We
calculate and describe the Lorentz violating contributions (from 
geometry only) to standard 
model propagators in section .  Because the  
corrections we calculate involve only the metric, they do not give all 
possible terms, but they give estimates that are independent of the background
of the other supergravity fields. In section ,
we then use our results to put limits on Lorentz violation in 
Randall-Sundrum type braneworlds and
comment on asymmetric warping in self-tuning braneworlds
.  Our limits imply that the energy density
that is self-tuned cannot be within a few orders of magnitude of the higher
dimensional fundamental scale, so there must be some other mechanism to
explain the smallness of the brane energy density.  We close with a
short discussion in section .  We do not address a solution
to the flatness problem of, but our results do sharpen
it somewhat.




A Simple String Braneworld 
In this section, we describe a braneworld model that solves the 10D type IIB
supergravity equations of motion locally at the position of the brane.
We treat the brane as a string theoretic D3-brane in the approximation that
it probes the ambient geometry without affecting it.  Since we are interested
in the effect of the geometry on the D3-brane fields, we justify the 
probe approximation by noting that a static brane should not be affected
by its own action on the background (as in electrostatics).  We will choose
a background that stabilizes the position of the D3-brane and allows for
asymmetrical warping.  We are most
interested in making order of magnitude estimates for Lorentz-breaking
effects, we will not try to incorporate the standard model.

For simplicity, we take the type IIB 3-form field strengths and RR scalar 
to vanish and dilaton to be constant with string coupling .  The
equations of motion for the 5-form field strength and the string frame
metric then become (see, for example, using
the conventions of)
R_MN  &=& g_s^2 96 F_MPQRS F_N ^PQRS 


dF = 0 &,& F = F  .We want to confine Lorentz violation to the gravitational sector, so we can
take an ansatz(We take Greek indices on spacetime, lower case 
Roman from the middle of the alphabet on the internal manifold, 
and capital Roman for all 10 dimensions.  We will usually use vector notation
for spatial directions of the noncompact spacetime but will sometimes 
denote them with indices . Hats will indicate orthonormal basis 
indices, as for a tangent space.) 
ds^2 &=& -e^A(y)  dt^2 +e^B(y)  dx^2 + g_mn (y) dy^m dy^n


F_m &=& -1 g_s  _ 
_m F(y)  ,  
F_mnpqr  = 1 g_s _mnpqr  ^s _s F(y) 
,where  is the volume form on spacetime or the internal 
manifold respectively.  Note that this ansatz automatically satisfies the
5-form equations ().
At the position of the D3-brane, , the
 are Riemann normal on the internal manifold(Through the rest
of this paper, we use "Riemann normal coordinates" to refer to coordinates
that are Riemann normal on the 6D internal manifold, ignoring the rest of the
metric.)  (
, ), 
and the functions  have Taylor expansions
, etc.

At zeroth order in , the Einstein equation () becomes
R_00 &=& 1 2 (a_m a^m +a_m ^m )
= 1 4  f_mf^m

R_ij &=& 1 2 (b_m b^m +b_m ^m )_ij  
= -1 4  f_m f^m 
_ij along the D3-brane and
transverse 
R_mn =R_mn  +1 2  a_mn -3 2  b_mn  = -1 4 
( 2 f_m f_n - f_pf^p _mn )
transverse to it, where  is the Ricci tensor for the internal
metric .  The other components are trivial.  
Note that eqn () is extraneous,
since we can satisfy it by choosing manifolds with the appropriate 
 (for example, many cases are satisfied with 
a warped Calabi-Yau manifold).  Since we will also want the second derivative
of the function  later, we should look at the next order in ;
along the brane, we have
(a_n a^n +a_n ^n)a_m +2 a^n a_nm &=&  f^n f_mn 


(b_n b^n +b_n ^n)b_m +2 b^n b_nm &=&  f^n f_mn 
 . To work within perturbation theory, we should stabilize the D-brane position.
From the action for D-branes (see, for reviews, 
), the potential for the brane
scalars - the brane coordinates - is the determinant of the pulled-back
metric minus the 4-form potential,
potential  V =  g_s  e^(A+3B)/2  - C_0123 
with brane tension .
For the forces on the brane to balance, we require
force 
1 2 a_m +3 2  b_m +f_m = 0 .The scalar masses come from the second derivative of the potential,
masssqr 
2g_s   _m_n V = 1 2  ( a_m+3b_m)
( a_n +3b_n) +a_mn +3b_mn  +2 g_s f_mn  .To stabilize all the brane coordinates, the trace of this matrix must be
positive.  Using eqns (,), we get
trace 
2g_s   ^2 V = f_mf^m +2g_s f_m ^m -a_ma^m 
-3b_mb^m .The equations of motion () seem not to constrain  tightly,
so there seems no obstacle to stabilizing the brane position.  We should 
note, however, that without the 5-form, the potential is at best flat or is
at a saddle point.  (In fact, with , we get just the  term.)

We close this section by noting that this is by no means the most general
way to stabilize the brane position; for example,
a nontrivial dilaton and 3-form flux
can contribute to the scalar potenial for multiple D-branes 
 
( gives a detailed mapping of the SUGRA fields to MSSM
parameters in a particular model).  However, since our purpose is to 
demonstrate that  corrections communicate Lorentz breaking from the
pure gravity sector to the brane fields, our background is sufficient.
From this point forward, we need only refer to the geometrical part of
our background ().


Stringy Tree Level Corrections 
In this section, we will identify terms in the action for brane fields
that violate Lorentz invariance due to worldsheet interactions with the
background metric.  We begin by examining the zero-th order action for
all the brane fields and verifying that there are no violations of Lorentz
invariance.  Then we move to leading order  corrections for the 
scalars and gauge fields.  Finally, we comment on corrections we do not
calculate but which should appear.  Through all the analysis, we look for
terms at second order in the brane fields because most experimental limits
come from Lorentz violating dispersion relations.  The strongest limits
are on different effective "speeds of light" (more appropriately,
maximum attainable velocities, or MAVs)
for different fields, so we will calculate just the difference of MAVs from
one for various D-brane fields.  

 Symmetric D-brane Action 
Including fermions, the action for a D3-brane 
 is
 
The fields in boldface are superfields in type II 10D superspace, where
 
is the collection of the pullbacks of the RR potentials.  Here, Greek
letters from the beginning of the alphabet refer to directions tangent
to the D3-brane, which are to lowest order in the brane fluctuations
.  There is a local 
symmetry on the worldvolume that reduces the Grassman superspace coordinates
to a single  Majorana-Weyl spinor  that contains four
worldvolume  fermions. 

The expansion of this action in terms of the D-brane scalars , 
gauge field , and fermions  was worked out
in for a background similar to ours (slightly more 
general but Lorentz invariant).  It is straightforward to write down
the renormalizable part of the action for our background (with the
flat metric at ):
S&=& - g_s d^4x [ 1 2  _mn 
_Y^m ^Y^n +g_s   V(Y) +(2)^2 4 
F_ F^  .

&&. -i ^_+i 4  
_MN  ^^MN ] .The tension is given by (This
gives a gauge coupling of .  Since we are taking a single D3,
we ignore terms associated with nonAbelian gauge theory.)  
and the potential
should only be taken out to quartic order in  (there are additional
terms at higher order in  
if we include nonrenormalizable interactions).  The last term includes
, the 10D spin connection 1-form in the direction
along the brane.  The only vanishing components are
spincon 
_0 ^0 m =-1 2  a_m e^m m   ,
  _i^j m  = -1 2 b_m e^mm  ^j _i
 ,so the final term becomes
lastterm 
-i 8  (a_m+3b_m) ^m .It has been shown in that this linear combination of
spinors vanishes due to the Majorana-Weyl nature of .  At ,
this is the only term that could have communicated the Lorentz breaking
from the gravity sector to the brane fields, so we must turn to stringy
corrections.(Clearly, there are Lorentz breaking terms in the
nonrenormalizable part, since the metric  is not Lorentz
invariant at .  We want instead changes to dispersion
relations, since limits on those are known.) 


 Corrections to Dispersion Relations 
Even at tree level in string amplitudes, the action () 
is incomplete; integrating out higher string modes gives a series of higher
derivative terms with  as the expansion parameter.  We see below
that, when some of the derivatives act on the background, these corrections
can actually modify the propagator (in the language of loops, renormalize
the wavefunction).  Next, we will review the  corrections 
that we consider, along with the necessary geometry.

Corrected DBI Action and Embedding Geometry 
Probably the most famous  corrections to D-brane actions are from the
couplings to the RR potentials; Riemann curvature becomes lower-dimensional
brane charge.  The Wess-Zumino part of the action is
aroof 
S_WZ =
Ce^F   A( 4^2
R_T) A (4^2 R_N)  where  is the Dirac "A-roof genus" and  are the tangent
and normal bundle Riemann tensors to be defined below
(see for a full derivation and
 for a review).  
Although these corrections
are generally nonvanishing for our background, we are not interested in 
them.  We do note that they modify the background, since now the D3-brane 
will have charge under the RR scalar, but we this is a subleading effect
and will not affect our conclusions.

To get the modified dispersion relations, we need to consider the corrections
to the DBI action, which have been studied in
.  
The most complete 
results for curved backgrounds are in, but only 
the geometry is considered and not other SUGRA fields.  The DBI action becomes
(considering the bosonic part only)
S_DBI &=& -d^4  e^-  -(
g_  
+ F _ )  [ 1 -(2)^2 192 
( (R_T)_ (R_T)^   
..

&&.. -2(R_T)_ (R_T)^ 
-(R_N)_a b (R_N)^a b  
+2R_a b R^a b ) ]up to .  There is an additional contribution at this 
order with an undetermined coefficient, but it vanishes on-shell, so it does
not affect S-matrix elements or dispersion relations.
Therefore, we can ignore it.  Here,  are normal bundle 
indices in an orthonormal basis with vielbein .

We now define the various Riemann and Ricci tensors above, as is discussed
in.
In the following, we use  to denote the pullback to the 
worldvolume or pushforward to the normal bundle,
but for brevity we write  and
.
Start with the extrinsic curvature, or second fundamental form, of the
D-brane embedding
extrinsic 
^a _  = ^a _M ( __X^M -(_T)^_ _X^M +
^M_NP _X^N_X^P) ,where  is the Christoffel connection of
the pulled-back metric.  The tangent and normal bundle Riemann tensors 
can be shown to be
(R_T)_ &=& P[R]_ +
_ab  ( ^a _ 
^b _ -^a _ 
^b _ ) ,

(R_N)_  ^a b  &=& P[R]_  ^ab 
+g^ ( ^a _ 
^b _  -^b _ 
^a _ ) .Then  is just the Ricci tensor associated with the 
tangent Riemann tensor, and
rbar 
R^ab  = g^ P[R]_ ^ab  _+g^ g^ ^a _ 
^b _  .As we continue, we should remember that the action () assumes
that all the other fields vanish.  We will address this point in 
ss:other , and we will below use T-duality to deduce possible couplings
between the extrinsic curvature and the worldvolume field strength.  Also,
the terms involving fermions are not known, although 
 
give steps in that direction.  We will consider that the corrections to
fermions will be similar to those for the scalars, which we can calculate.



Maximum Attainable Velocities for Scalars 
To get the modified MAVs for the scalar fields on the brane, we just need
to calculate the Lorentz violating kinetic terms that arise in the 
corrected action ().  We can write these all as
 (because  differs
by a Lorentz invariant term).  Knowing this allows us to simplify our
calculation greatly; we need keep only terms up to 
and can ignore terms in which  appears without a derivative as well as
 terms.  Also,
since the background would be Lorentz invariant if the warp factors
were equal, , we can write  and take only terms in which
, the Lorentz violating function, appears.  To get the best limits
on Lorentz violation, we keep only terms that are linear in .

The key to our results is that the extrinsic curvature has terms that are
zero-th order in the brane fluctuations that come from .  
In our background, the extrinsic curvature is
^m_00  &=& 1 2  a^m -a_n_0 Y^n_0 Y^m+ ,


^m_0i  &=& -1 2  a_n_i Y^n _0 Y^m -1 2  b_n
_0 Y^n _i Y^m+ ,

^m_ij  &=& -1 2  b^m _ij  -b_n _( i. 
Y^n_. j)  Y^m+ .We use standard notation regarding symmetrization of indices with a weighting
of .  Also, to reduce proliferation of indices, we replace the normal
bundle index  with the coordinate index  since they are the
same at lowest order in perturbation theory.  We have still included all
the appropriate terms from the expansion of the normal bundle vielbein, 
however.  Additional zero-th order terms appear in the Riemann tensor part of
.  We leave those, along with the details of the rest of the
calculation to the appendix .

After much algebra, and carefully accounting for all terms, we find the
following Lorentz violating kinetic terms for the scalars to linear order
in :
S &=&  g_s  d^4 x (2)^2 192 
  Y^m  Y^n [ 21 2 b^2 b_( m. 
_. n)  +5 bb_m b_n -1 2 b^2
_mn +bb_mn 
-4^pb_p(m. b_. n) .

&&. 
-4 b^pb_p( m. _. n)  +47 4  
b^2 b_mn  +4 b^pq _pq _mn +4^pq b_p b_q
_mn +20 b^pq _p b_q _mn ] .
Because the action () does not include contributions from the
background 5-form, these are probably not the only Lorentz violating
kinetic terms for the scalars.  However, because Lorentz invariance is
broken by the background, there is no reason to suppose that the terms we
have calculated are precisely canceled by those that we have not.  Therefore,
we can take these as an estimate of the change in MAV for the scalars.
From (), we can see clearly why these terms modify the
MAV of the scalars; by a field dependent  redefinition of the
"speed of light," we can clearly combine all the time and space derivatives
of the fields into the usual form .  Each scalar
has a Lorentz invariant kinetic action, but the Lorentz groups are in 
general different for the different scalars.  This way of thinking about
our corrections is essentially the formalism of.

Of course, even at this order in the string expansion, there are many other 
corrections to the action.  For example, the constant terms in the 
extrinsic curvature give a cosmological constant at when the brane
is at ; more generally, there is a new contribution to the potential
for the D-brane position.  We are not really expanding around the vacuum of
the theory.  Similarly, the supergravity background should be altered (even
if we had incorporated the tension and charge of the brane to begin with)
because the A-roof corrections induce a charge for other supergravity 
fields, notably the RR scalar.  We will not worry about these effects,
since they will be suppressed by , and the warp factor should be
somewhat less curved than the string scale for supergravity to be valid
in the first place.  Thus, in perturbation theory, they do not affect the 
leading Lorentz violation.  Also, as we mentioned above, there will be other 
corrections due to the 5-form field strength, and we know that for the 
"black 3-brane" background
the corrections should all cancel because of supersymmetry.  As another
example, the scalar wavefunctions will be renormalized by Lorentz
invariant kinetic terms in the correction; again, this is suppressed by
.  Finally, there are many, generally nonrenormalizable,
interactions introduced.


Maximum Attainable Velocity for Photon 
To find the communication of Lorentz violation to electrodynamics from
gravity, we proceed by a somewhat indirect route.  The derivative corrections
to the DBI action are not known in a curved background, so, rather than
generalize the flat space results of,
we use T-duality to relate the field strength to the scalars.  We will
also argue that our results are plausible terms in the curved-space
generalization of.

Our T-duality argument runs as follows.  Suppose we compactify one of the
noncompact spatial dimensions, say , on a large circle.   Then
we perform T-duality on , giving a metric of 
tdmetric 
ds^2 = -e^A dt^2 +e^B _i=1 ^2 ( dx^i)^2 +e^-B ( dx^3
)^2 +g_mn  dy^m dy^n with, as before, all components of the metric depending only on .
Now  is compactified on a small circle, and the braneworld is a D2-brane.
In fact, this metric is of the same form as our original metric ()
except that  is not a Riemann normal coordinate.  The only difference 
this makes from the calculations of
sss:mavs  is that we now have to keep in mind that there is a 
nonvanishing Christoffel symbol  that contributes kinetic terms
to  ( will not 
matter because  will already be second order in 
).  Otherwise some numerical factors differ.  If
we recalculate eqn () for fluctuations of  in 2 dimensions,
we find
x3mav 
S = _2 g_s,2   d^3x (2)^2 192 
 X^3 ^2 [ 11 4  b^2 b
+3 b^mn _mn  +3^mn b_mb_n +9b^mn _mb_n]
 .Here 
 are the appropriate tension and string coupling for the 
D2-brane case.  

If we then T-dualize back to the D3-brane and take the  circle radius
to infinity, we get back the original tension and string coupling and take
.  Then by gauge invariance, we must replace
, and isotropy requires that we
promote .
Therefore, we end up with a correction to the photon kinetic term of
photmav 
S =  g_s   d^4x (2)^2 192 
F _ij F ^ij  [ 11 4  b^2 b
+3 b^mn _mn  +3^mn b_mb_n +9b^mn _mb_n]
 .So we see that even the speed of light is modified; the MAV of a photon is
not 1!

Let us check this term against the known  corrections
for the worldvolume gauge field.  For a flat background,showed that the corrections can be given in terms of a non-symmetric
metric  and
its Riemann tensor.  So in curved space, we could easily have 
 terms, including such terms
as .  
As it turns out,
the method of replacing  only works
to  for the Wess-Zumino terms when the background is
curved, but we are working only to that order in any case.




Other Corrections 
We already discussed some of the other corrections that appear for scalars
at the end of .  These are  terms that
we could have calculated but have not (because the experimental limits are
far greater on the dispersion relations that we have calculated).  One
additional correction of this type is of second order in the scalars but
fourth order in derivatives; they introduce quartic terms in the dispersion
relation.  Some of them T-dualize to a modification for the field strength
of the form , and
there are actually experimental 
limits on such terms.  However, they are very weak
compared to the limits on the second order terms.

We are not just limited to  corrections, even though
these are the only ones known (and incompletely, at that).  Because the 
extrinsic curvature and some of the Riemann components have terms that are
zero-th order in D-brane fields and their derivatives, we expect that all
orders in  should contribute to kinetic terms, with a suppression
by the string length over the warp factor curvature length.  This 
should be small for supergravity to remain valid, but it should still be within
a few orders of magnitude of unity in a Randall-Sundrum type model with only
one fundamental scale.  Of interest
is whether the Riemann tensor of the internal metric  can
contribute to the Lorentz violating terms at some order in the  
expansion; in appendix , we see that it couples to the scalars
only in a Lorentz invariant way in the terms we consider.  Since, in any
realistic (say a warped Calabi-Yau) compactification, we expect 
the curvature of the compact manifold to be of order the string scale (and
therefore the fundamental Planck scale), such terms could contribute to
very high orders in .

We also mention again the fact that there should be corrections due to 
the other background bulk supergravity fields even at .
Unless they also couple to the background metric, we would not expect them
to violate Lorentz invariance as long as their background does not, but
it would be interesting to be able to study them.

Most importantly, the worldvolume fermions should also have Lorentz violation
kinetic terms from  corrections to the  symmetric D-brane action.
Unfortunately, the  corrections to the DBI action are
not known in  symmetric form, so we cannot calculate them.  
Progress in this direction was reported in, but we will
simply estimate that the Lorentz violating terms will be roughly the same
for the fermions as for the scalars.

We close this section with a comment about the applicability of our results, 
then.  We have calculated only 
the purely gravitational contribution to the Lorentz violating kinetic terms
and only at lowest order in .  It is very likely, at least in some
models, that contributions from other fields or even from higher orders in
 (because the internal Riemann curvature should go as ) could 
also be significant.  Therefore, the reader should not consider the limits
we derive here to be definitive for any specific model (especially since the
stringy details of most models are not yet resolved).  Rather, the limits
we get are somewhat rough but model independent because they depend only
on the metric.  Additionally, because the Lorentz invariance is broken by the
background geometry, extra contributions to the  corrections should
not change the order of magnitude of our limits.  
Almost any model of asymmetric warping, if considered as a
solution of string theory, will be subject to them.

Limits on Asymmetric Warping 
We can now use the results of s:corrections  to apply known 
experimental limits on Lorentz violation in the standard model to 
asymmetric warping in the gravitational sector.  In particular, many 
unobserved effects, such as C erenkov radiation by charged particles 
in vacuum and photon decay, can occur if the MAVs of photons and fermions
are different(We do not consider interactions,
such as electromagnetic muon decay, that also violate lepton number.) .  
In fact, vacuum C erenkov radiation and photon decay are so efficient 
that we should observe no particles above threshhold for those interactions
(see, for example).  These two interactions give
the constraint that the magnitude of the difference of photon and electron
MAVs should not be greater than  (in units with the speed of light
equal to unity).  A demonstration of this result, along with a review of 
many dispersion relation tests, is given in.

In fact, we could use more stringent constraints.  For example, ignoring the
parton structure, the proton MAV should differ from the photon MAV by no 
more than .  Atomic spectroscopy experiments
measuring spatial anisotropy of nuclear dipole and quadrupole couplings
give a similar (indirect) bound of ; 
this is the limit used by.
Additionally, other Lorentz
(and even CPT) violating effects in QED have been considered by many authors
(see, for example,).  However,
these mainly deal with polarization effects, and we will not consider them.
To be conservative, we will require that the difference in fermion and
photon MAVs be less than  in absolute value.  However, 
for comparison to the results of, we will also 
quote results using a limit of .

From equations (,), we can therefore see that,
including the numerical factors, we should have
bound 
 ^2 (b_m)^3 _m ,   ^2 b_mn _m b_m , 
 ^2_mn  (b_m)^2 , 
 ^2_mn b^mn  < 10^-16 ,10^-22  in terms of magnitude.
We will use this to put limits on the Lorentz violating function 
in the following subsection, and we will relate this bound to the 
speed of graviton propagation in the asymmetrically warped background.  
Like, we will find the range of parameter space when
our limits improve on the bound  (see 
 for a discussion relating this bound to 
experiments).


Perturbations around Randall-Sundrum 
The prototypical warped braneworld models are those of Randall and Sundrum
 (see for a 
general review), which have one or two branes in a total of 5 dimensions.  
Therefore, we take the asymmetric
warping to be a small perturbation around the Lorentz invariant 
Randall-Sundrum metric below.
To get our limits, we will assume that the other 5 dimensions of string
theory are compactified at the 5-dimensional Planck scale , so the 
fundamental 10D scale, the string scale, is the 5D scale, .
It is trivial to extend our analysis to other cases given some specific
model and our results should not be significantly changed; 
however, we will focus on the most basic case here.  

If the visible sector brane is at , the Randall-Sundrum metric is
RSmetric 
ds^2 = e^2 k y  dx^dx_+ dy^2 where the -(+) sign corresponds to the one (two) brane model.  This is
 with curvature given by the mass scale .  To make the
supergravity approximation valid but to avoid naturalness problems, 
we should have .  For concreteness, we will quote limits 
taking the somewhat arbitrary value .

We should also briefly address the warping in the other 5 dimensions, since
they enter into the limits ().  In a traditional compactification,
this warping vanishes, and, in more general warped compactifications, those
warp factors should not be larger than the fundamental Planck scale if we
can use a geometrical interpretation.  A related issue is the origin of the
5D cosmological constant.  In string theory, this would be related to 
the background supergravity fields, and, in the simple model of section
, the 5-form plays the role of a negative cosmological
constant (see the Einstein equations (,)).  As
long as  is aimed along the Randall-Sundrum  direction, this is 
the same situation as in the  solution of
string theory.  Because of the equilibrium condition (), we would
not have large warp factors in the extra 5 dimensions without taking
.
Therefore, we will assume that the warping in the small compact dimensions
is no larger than  and
does not affect the magnitude of our limits. This choice 
gives the most lenient limits in any event. 

Since the second derivatives of the warp factor vanish in the Randall-Sundrum
scenario, we get the limits
RSlimits 
_m M_5  < (M_5 k )^3 , 
_mn  M^2_5  < ( M_5 k )^2  .Putting in specific numbers for  and , we have
RSlimits2 
_m M_5  < 10^-13 ,10^-19  , 
_mn  M^2_5  < 10^-14 ,10^-20  .These numbers suggest a type of hierarchy problem; perhaps the asymmetric
warping is caused by a black hole or other gravitating object very far from 
our brane in the  direction.  This is the usual radius stabilization 
problem.

Let us now relate the limits (,) to the known
limits on the MAV for gravitons.  Specifically, we will ask in what region
of parameter space do our results improve the limit .
To do so, we must relate the Lorentz violating function  to 
the speed of gravitational wave propagation.  With a global solution, we
could do this by finding the higher dimensional zero-mode of the graviton,
but we will need to make do with perturbation theory since we have only
a solution expanded around .  Our ansatz is to ignore the 5 small
dimensions and use the Randall-Sundrum zero-mode as the graviton wavefunction
in the warped dimension.  We use this wavefunction to get an expectation
value for the speed of gravity, .

For perturbations around the one-brane model, we find that
onebranecg 
c_g-1 _m M_5  M_5 k , 
_mn  M_5^2 (M_5 k )^2 .Depending on which limit we use for the standard model MAVs, these give
us limits better than  when 
for either  or .  The two-brane model is
slightly more complicated because the expectation value depends on the
position of the regulator brane, .  However, to solve the hierarchy
problem, typically .  Then we can approximate the graviton
speed by taking () and replacing .
This gives, for , an improvement over  when
 and, for , an improvement when
.  Since we expect , this covers
almost all of the expected parameter space.  We should also note that
there is a one-sided bound of  from gravitational 
C erenkov radiation.  Our bounds can compete with
or even improve on this more stringent bound (but without sign) when 
.  

We note briefly that these bounds compare well to the
field theoretic loop bounds of.  When using the
same bounds on standard model MAVs as, we find
an improvement on limits for  in precisely the region of parameter
space that we naturally expect to occur.  This seems to have wider
applicability than bounds from loops, which are effective when the 
fundamental scale of the higher dimensions is itself small.  In warped
compactifications, this may not be the case.


Comments on Cosmological Constant Self-Tuning 
Now we will comment on the application of our results to models of 
asymmetric warping used to solve the cosmological constant problem.  As
is well known, the size of the cosmological constant is as yet unexplained
by theory.  The review considers many different
possible resolutions of the cosmological constant problem, including 
the possibility of "tuning" by a scalar field that reduces the effect of 
the vacuum energy density.  The conclusion is that such a method does not
work in models with standard 4D physics.  Nonetheless, self-tuning has 
enjoyed a revival of interest with the discovery by 
 that vacuum energy density on a
brane can be translated into curvature of a bulk scalar.  Because of 
singularities in the bulk, however, these models require fine-tuning to
reproduce 4D gravity and
therefore do not excape the no-go theorem stated above 
.

Seemingly, the way around this difficulty is to place the singularity 
behind an event horizon; additionally, the spacetime metric can be written
in a 5D Schwarzschild-like form
schwarzschild 
ds^2 = -h(r) dt^2 +(kr)^2 dx^2 +h^-1 (r) dr^2  ,where  is the same as in the Randall-Sundrum case (for ,
this is just Randall-Sundrum in different coordinates).  These types of 
solutions with a charged black hole background were first studied in 
 and generalized in 
.  

Even though the full metric does not have  symmetry, 
 
argue that these asymmetrically
warped models evade limits on standard model Lorentz violation because
brane fields feel an  symmetry as long as the brane stays at a 
fixed position.  The only effect at the field theory tree level 
would be to alter the speed of gravitons.  We have seen that Lorentz violation
can be communicated to the standard model both by loopsand by  corrections in string theory as in section .
It is natural to ask whether the limits we derived above are stringent
enough to rule out these models.

The difficulty is that the warp factors at the brane are determined entirely
by the energy density on the brane through jump conditions if we work only
in 5D.  (See for some of
the consequences this has for cosmology.)  Therefore, we find that the 
warp factors for Riemann normal coordinate  are given by 
ccwarping 
b_y =  3M_5^3 , _y = - M_5^3 
(1+), b_yy = -^2 6M_5^6 (1+), 
_yy  = 24k^2 +^2 54M_5^6 (7+60),where  is the brane energy density and 
the brane equation of state is .  To avoid a naked
singularity in the bulk, .  Ignoring this
exotic equation of state and any other cosmological difficulties, our bounds
() become
 ^2 b_y^3_y  
&& ( M_5^4  )^4 (1+)
<

 ^2 b_yy  b_y _y && ( M_5^4  )^4 
(1+)^2 < 

 ^2 b_y^2 _yy   && (k M_5 )^2
( M_5^4 )^2 <

 ^2 b_yy _yy  &&  (k M_5 )^2
( M_5^4 )^2 (1+)< .   assuming that  is larger than , which seems reasonable
if only because of power counting.  The best bound is the third one, since
it avoids ambiguity due to the unspecified value of .  Taking
values for  as before, we find .  
So we cannot use asymmetric warping to tune away 5D Planck scale energy
densities; some other mechanism must explain why the brane energy density
is at least a few orders of magnitude smaller than .  This somewhat
lessens the appeal of the self-tuning mechanism.

It is worth noting that the constraints should be a bit tighter if we note that
the warping  should not be determined solely by the brane energy density
when the setup is embedded into more than 5D (because the jump conditions
are no longer boundary conditions).  If we take, as seems likely in a 10D
scenario, , then we get
ccbound2 
(k M_5 )^3  M_5^4  (1+) < ,
(k M_5 )^4 < .If we use  as before, we find 
 as in ss:general .
However, 
the second relation gives , which is starting 
to reintroduce a hierarchy problem (this time in the bulk).  If we accept
this limit on the symmetric part of the warping, then eqn ( 
gives 
ccbound3 
 M_5^4  (1+) <^1/4  = 10^-4 ,10^-5.4  .This is actually weaker (even if  is order unity) 
than eqn (), but it does use a value
of the bulk energy density that may be undesirably small.



Discussion 
We have seen how the  expansion of string theory can communicate 
symmetry breaking effects between different sectors of a compactification
model - in this case, Lorentz violation is transmitted from gravitation to
the standard model particles.  To our knowledge, this is the first use of
 corrections for such a purpose (but do note that bounds on 
noncommutativity and Lorentz violation in string theory have been studied 
).  We
then used the Lorentz violating standard model propagators to put limits
on asymmetric warping in string compactifications.  These limits, in our
opinion, reduce the appeal of asymmetrically warped models of cosmological
constant self-tuning because they require some other mechanism to
reduce the brane energy density to acceptable values of Lorentz violation.
We should note again that our calculations are not complete even to
 because the additional terms in the action due to 
the background supergravity field strengths are unknown; however, they are
very generally applicable because they only depend on the warp factors.
In addition, our limits seem somewhat stronger than the bounds derived from
field theoretic loops; they improve on previous
limits for the speed of gravity in the interesting region of parameter
space.  We should also note that the limits from the  expansion are
good even if we use a relatively weak bound for standard model Lorentz
violation.  The key parameter in our limits is the ratio of the Lorentz
invariant warp factor derivative to the fundamental Planck scale, as opposed
to the Planck scale itself for loops.  From naturalness considerations,
we expect that the ratio will be near unity.


To close, we comment that  corrections to the D-brane action seem 
very applicable to braneworld models.  They may be useful in correcting
the backgrounds used in the models, just as the  corrections for the
bulk action have been (see, for example, 
)(Also, in Lorentz violating models, 
nonrenormalizable terms may be needed to maintain causality
.) .  
They could
also be used, as in this paper, to discuss the communication of symmetry
breaking between brane and bulk fields.  As one particular example, string
compactifications with 3-form fluxes and a no-scale supergravity 
interpretation, which have been of great interest recently, exhibit 
sequestering of supersymmetry breaking.  That is,
the brane fields do not feel the bulk breaking of supersymmetry at tree 
level.  Although a better knowledge of  corrections involving 
bulk field strengths and worldvolume fermions
will be needed, it would be interesting to carry out an explicit calculation
of supersymmetry breaking on the brane due to the 3-forms.  As we have
seen in the case of  breaking, the  corrections can be just
as important as loop corrections.  They are also somewhat easier to 
compute, since the known corrections can be evaluated using only 
differentiation and algebra and do not require justifying a regularization
procedure for perturbative gravity.  We hope, therefore, that we have
introduced a new technology for the investigation of braneworld 
compactifications of string theory.

Calculation of Scalar Kinetic Term Corrections 
We collect here some of the details of the calculations in section
, specifically the Lorentz violating scalar kinetic terms of
.  For notational convenience, we will call all spacetime
coordinates , whether they are the compact space coordinates  or 
not.

We start by specifying the tangent to the D-brane, which
we take as  with perturbatively
small .  Then the normal bundle vielbein satisfies
normviel 
_X^M ^a _M = 0 or  ^a _= -^__X^m ^a _m which has solution to second order
normviel2 
^a _= -^__X^m e_m^m 
^a _m  , ^a _m = ^a _m 
e^m _m - 1 2  g^ _ ^
_^_X^p _X^n e_n^n 
_n ^a  g_mp  . Here  is the vielbein of  and is trivial
at the position of the brane.  Since its expansion would just give powers of
 and not derivatives, we will ignore it from now on.  Also, for 
notational convenience, since the normal bundle indices  always
enter through Kronecker deltas with compact space indices, we will abuse
notation slightly and replace  with  in future formulae.

The nonvanishing Christoffel symbols are
christoffel 
^0_0m =1 2 _m A , ^m_00 = 1 2 
g^mn  e^A _n A , ^i_jm  = 1 2 _m B^i_j
, ^m_ij = -1 2 g^mn e^B_n B _ij on the spacetime and
(_T)^0_00 &=&1 2 _0 X^m _m A , (_T)^0_0i =
1 2 _i X^m _m A , (_T)^i_00 =1 2 e^A-B 
^ij  _j X^m_m A

(_T)^0_ij  &=& 1 2 e^B-A _ij _0 X^m _m B ,
(_T)^i_0j =1 2 ^i_j _0X^m _m B

(_T)^i_jk  &=& 1 2  (^i_k _j X^m+^i_j
_k X^m - _jk ^il _l X^m)_m B
on the tangent space.  This is just the Christoffel symbol of the pulled-back
metric .  
Plugging into eqn (), we can very 
easily get eqn () for the extrinsic curvature.  

Then, from eqn (), the tangent Riemann components out to 
 are
(R_T)_0i0j  &=& -1 4 a^mb_m _ij  +1 2 a_m b_n
_ij _0 X^m _0 X^n -1 2  a_(m  b_n) _i
X^m _j X^n 

&&-1 2 ( a_mn +3 2  a_m a_n)
_i X^m_j X^n +1 2 (b_mn +1 2 b_mb_n)
_ij _0 X^m_0 X^n

(R_T)_ijkl  &=& 1 4 b^2(_ik _jl -_il 
_jk )+1 2 (b_mn +3 2 b_m b_n)


&&( _i X^m _k X^n _jl  +_j X^m _l X^n _ik 
-_i X^m _l X^n _jk  -_j X^m _k X^n _il )
 . The other components are only , so they square to
.  When squaring, we also need to take into 
account the second order part of the inverse metric pull-back.  Note that
the only terms involving  come from .  To get
 we just contract the Riemann tensor, being careful of
second order terms in the metric.

From eqn (), the normal bundle Riemann tensor is always second
order in , so it does not contribute to the kinetic terms.  That
leaves just .  We end up with
R^mn  &=& -1 2  ( a^mn +a^m a^n) -3 2 b^mn 
+R_pmnq _X^p^X^q -( a_p ^(m +
3 2 a_pa^(m )_0 X^n)  _0 X^p 

&&-1 2 (b_p ^(m  -3 2 b_p b^(m )
X^mX^n
-1 2  (a^mn  +5 2 a^m a^n)_pq _0 X^p
_0 X^q 

&&+1 2  (b^mn -1 2 b^m b^n )_pq 
X^pX^q .Here  is the Riemann tensor of ; note that
it enters in a Lorentz invariant fashion.
Getting the action () is just a matter of squaring.
