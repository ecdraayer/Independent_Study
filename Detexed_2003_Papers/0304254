In our previous papers, we prove the no-ghost theorem without light-cone directions (hep-th/0005002, hep-th/0303051). We point out that our results are valid for more general backgrounds. In particular, we prove the no-ghost theorem for  in the context of the BRST quantization (with the standard restriction on the spin). We compare our BRST proof with the OCQ proof and establish the BRST-OCQ equivalence for . The key in both approaches lies in the certain structure of the matter Hilbert space as a product of two Verma modules. We also present the no-ghost theorem in the most general form.

Introduction 


Even though strings on curved backgrounds have been widely discussed in the last decade or so, rigorous discussion within string theory is very difficult. This is due to the lack of the string theory on general backgrounds, especially the no-ghost theorem. As is well-known, string theory generally contains negative norm states (ghosts) from timelike oscillators. However, they do not appear as physical states. This is well-established for string theory in flat spacetime. When the background spacetime is curved, things are not clear though. 

Standard proofs of the no-ghost theorem requires light-cone directions; if the background is written as  with a unitary CFT , . This is true both in the old covariant quantization (OCQ) and in the BRST quantization.

In our previous papers, we show the no-ghost theorem for  using the BRST quantization

. (See Ref.  for the NSR string). Here, we extend our results to more general backgrounds. We point out that 
 
The vanishing theorem is valid if one can isolate the timelike direction as a  CFT and if the matter Hilbert space is written as a direct product of two Verma modules (as in vanishing ), one for the  CFT and another for the rest, which is assumed to be a unitary CFT.
The no-ghost theorem is also valid for the above Hilbert space (under a certain condition. See no-ghost .)

One particular example is , so we establish the no-ghost theorem in the BRST quantization of . We heavily use the previous results on the old covariant quantization of . In particular, we impose the restriction on the  spin  for the discrete series representations. 

In the context of the OCQ, the no-ghost theorem for  has been known. However, the foundation of the perturbative string theory lies in the BRST quantization, and the OCQ often needs to be justified from the underlying BRST quantization. We compare our proof with the proof in the OCQ and also establish the BRST-OCQ equivalence for . It turns out that the key in both approaches is the certain structure of the Hilbert space mentioned above.[Eq. hilbert  for the BRST quantization and Eq. OCQ_basis2  for the OCQ]

The organization of the present paper is as follows. First, in the next section, we briefly review string theory on . The full proof of the no-ghost theorem is rather involved, so we give the outline of the proof in outline . Section  and  are the discussion of the vanishing theorem and the no-ghost theorem for , respectively. In no-ghost , we present the no-ghost theorem in the most general form. We also discuss a time-dependent background of Ref.  where the background has ghosts in certain cases and explain how the background violates the assumptions of our theorem in those cases. In equiv , we establish the BRST-OCQ equivalence for the backgrounds our no-ghost theorem applies. We summarize our notations and conventions of the BRST quantization in appA . The presentation of the proof in our second paper is slightly different from our first paper although the proof itself is very similar; we will follow the style of our second paper.




Strings on  

 with NS-NS flux is described by the  WZW model. In most applications, one tensors an internal CFT  and considers string theory on . We follow the notations and the conventions of Ref.  with some minor changes. 

The Kac-Moody algebra for  is


[a m , b n ] = i ^ab _  c  c m+n  + k 2 m ^ab  _m+n ,

where  is the level,  and . In terms of the modes , the algebra is

&&[+ m , - n ] = -2 3 m+n  + km _m+n ,

&&[ m ,  n ] = 0,

&&[3 m ,  n ] =  m+n ,

&&[3 m , 3 n ] = -k 2  m _m+n .

The matter Virasoro generator 

m  &=& 1 k-2  _n _ab  a m-n  b n  


&=& 1 k-2  _n 
1 2  (+ m-n  - n  + - m-n  + n ) - 3 m-n  3 n   

satisfies the Virasoro algebra with central charge

c_SL(2,)  = 3k k-2 

and

&& [ m , n ]=m  m+n , 

&& [3 m , n ]=m 3 m+n .

We always assume  to ensure a positive central charge as well as a single timelike direction. When there is no internal CFT ,  so that .



Unflowed representations 

If the spectrum is bounded below, acting repeatedly with  always produces a Kac-Moody primary which is annihilated by . For the moment, let us suppose that this is the case and call these representations as "unflowed representations" (for the reason which will soon become clear.) For the WZW model, a Kac-Moody primary is also a Virasoro primary. A Kac-Moody primary forms a representation of the global  generated by the zero modes . Then, the representations of the  current algebra are built over Kac-Moody primaries by applying  in all possible ways. There are five classes of the unitary representations of the global . They are characterized by the second Casimir  and :

 

Lowest weight discrete series:

D ^+_j =  j,m : m=j, j+1, j+2, ,

where  such that .

Highest weight discrete series:

D ^-_j =  j,m : m=-j, -j-1, -j-2, ,

where  such that .

Principal continuous series:

C ^_j =  j,,m : m=, 1, 2, ,

where  and , .

Complementary (Supplementary) series:

E ^_j =  j,,m : m=, 1, 2, ,

where ,  and .

Identity representation: trivial representation with .



We always consider the universal cover of ;

so, the spin  is not restricted to be a half-integer or an integer. A complete basis for the square integrable functions on  is known from the harmonic analysis; they are given by the matrix elements of the first three representations  (with ) and . Thus, we consider only those representations. We denote the representations of the full current algebra built over those zero mode representations by  and .

Now, the on-shell condition at grade  reduces to 

-j(j-1) k-2 +N+
Here,  is a conformal weight from the internal CFT . For the continuous series, this condition is satisfied only for . By construction, they satisfy the other physical state conditions and they are unitary. Thus, only the discrete series are usually considered for the no-ghost theorem (for the unflowed representations.)

The no-ghost theorem for the background has been widely discussed using the OCQ-. Among them, Refs.  show the theorem for  with the additional restriction on the spin  for :

0<j<k 2 .

We sketch the proof in appC . 

The bound in turn implies that the grade is bounded above from the on-shell condition on-shell :

N+<1+k 4 





Flowed representations 


It is proposed in Ref.  that these representations appeared in the last subsection are not the only representations appear in the WZW model. To see this, note that the current algebra is invariant under the following transformation:

3 n  &=& 3 n  - k 2  w _n, 

+ n  &=& + n+w , 

- n  &=& - n-w .

Then, the Virasoro generators  are related to  by

m  = m  -w 3 m -k 4  w^2 _m.

This transformation is known as the spectral flow. Reference  proposed to include the representations transformed by the spectral flow. Denote the resulting representations by  and , where  labels the spin before the flow (Similarly,  and ). The on-shell condition becomes

0  = -(k-2  - w m  - k 4  w^2 + N  + =1.

In general,  is not bounded below for the flowed representations. However, . Thus, in order for the discrete representations with  not to appear, the spin  has to satisfy the bound

1 2 <j<k-1 2 .

Note that this bound is stronger than the bound bound1 , which is needed to show the no-ghost theorem. When  saturates the lower bound of Eq. bound2 ,  appears; likewise when  saturates the lower bound of Eq. bound2 ,  appears. The representations  correspond to long strings.

Then, Ref.  shows the no-ghost theorem for the spectral flowed representations with the bound bound1 . 



The outline of the proof 

Now, we turn into the discussion of the no-ghost theorem in the BRST quantization. The full proof of the no-ghost theorem is rather involved, so  we give the outline here. The terminology appeared below is explained later. The proof of the no-ghost theorem consists of 3 steps (outline ).

 
 
 
The outline of the proof. 

 

Step 1:
The first is to show the vanishing theorem . The vanishing theorem states that the -cohomology is trivial except at the zero ghost number. This is done by choosing an appropriate filtration  for your BRST operator . A filtration allows us to use a simplified BRST operator  and we can first study the cohomology of . If the -cohomology is trivial, so is the -cohomology (Lemma 3.1 of Ref. ); this is the reason why the filtration is so useful. However, the particular filtration used in standard proofs is also part of the reason why  in those proofs. 

Step 2:
The second is to compute and compare the index  and the signature  of the cohomology group explicitly. If the index is equal to the signature, the no-ghost theorem holds provided the vanishing theorem is valid.


Step 1 and 2 themselves consist of several steps, which are explained in vanishing  and , respectively.

In this approach the matter Virasoro generators themselves play a very important role, and it is useful to have an additional step:

 

Step 0:
Write the matter Hilbert space in terms of products of two Verma modules, one for the  CFT and the other for the unitary CFT .


The step is useful particularly at Step 1.2 and is convenient when one discusses general spacetime backgrounds.



The vanishing theorem for string theory 

The proof of the vanishing theorem consists of three steps (vanishing ):

 

[] Step 1.1:
Apply our filtration a  la Frenkel, Garland, and Zuckerman (Ref.; Eq. (35) of Ref. ). With FGZ's filtration, the simplified BRST operator  can be further decomposed as a sum of two differentials,  and . This decomposition is crucial for the proof; it reduces the problem to the -cohomology, and  acts only on a "" CFT, which contains the timelike part and the  ghost part. This is the reason why the proof does not require . 

[] Step 1.2:
If the -cohomology is trivial, so is the -cohomology. This follows from a Ku nneth formula. Then, the -cohomology is trivial as well from the general property of filtration.

[] Step 1.3:
Now, the problem is reduced to the -cohomology. Show the vanishing theorem for the -cohomology. 


See Refs.  for the actual proof.


 
 
 
The outline of the proof of the vanishing theorem. 

In our previous papers, we show the vanishing theorem for .

We actually show the vanishing theorem in a more general setting. Let  be a Verma module with highest weight  and central charge . Then, we have shown the following theorem:
 [The vanishing theorem for string theory]

The -cohomology can be non-zero only at zero ghost number 

if the matter part of the Hilbert space  can be decomposed as a sum of the following two Verma modules:

 
(Or more generally, the  part is written as nondegenerate Verma modules.)


Here, the restriction on the weights  and  comes in order for the Verma modules to form the basis of the  nonunitary CFT and the  unitary CFT, respectively.

Then, the only nontrivial step here is to establish that the theory in question has the Hilbert space in the form of Eq. hilbert ; this corresponds to Step 0 of outline . 

In addition to the vanishing theorem, we have actually established a stronger statement in the paper:
 [FP-ghost decoupling theorem]

Physical states do not contain Fadeev-Popov ghosts if  is decomposed as in Eq. hilbert .

Although the theorem itself is not necessary to establish the no-ghost theorem, it is useful to establish, e.g. , the BRST-OCQ equivalence (equiv ). 


























Now, we discuss the examples where our vanishing theorem can be applied. Again, one merely has to check that a theory has the Hilbert space in the form of Eq. hilbert .



 case 

For , choose the  CFT as a CFT generated by the timelike oscillators . The isomorphism
 
can be easily shown using the Kac determinant for  (Eq. (45) in Ref. ). The CFT  is a unitary CFT, so .



Flat spacetime or  cases 


Again, choose the  CFT as a CFT generated by the timelike oscillators . The  CFT is a product of the CFT generated by  and a unitary CFT . When , the  CFT can be written in terms of Verma modules with , so reduces to the  case.



 


The Hilbert space of the  WZW model can also be decomposed as in Eq. hilbert  under the restriction on the spin bound1 . This construction of the Hilbert space has been done in Refs. ; it was discussed in order to prove the no-ghost theorem for  in the context of the old covariant quantization. 

Choose the  CFT as a CFT generated by , which corresponds to the timelike : 

m =-1 k  _n 3 m-n  3 n  .

Also, define 

m  = m  -m .


By construction,  commute with  and thus with . Thus, as far as Virasoro generators are concerned, the  WZW model can be decomposed as

U(1) SL(2,)/U(1)

with the Hilbert space consisting of all states of the form

 
where  and . 
Thus, we regard the coset part as . When there is an internal CFT , we include it as a part of . 

Note that even though we write , it does not mean that the  part is completely separated from the coset part as a direct product; the -value for the Virasoro primaries must be common in both.

Since such a construction of the Hilbert space is fairly standard, here we merely check that the weights  and  are as in Eq. hilbert . We discuss the unflowed and flowed representations separately.

(i) Unflowed representations:  The  CFT has 

m^2 k  0.

Thus, the CFT can be written in terms of the Verma modules  except  states. However, there is no on-shell state with  except a few states, which have zero ghost number and have positive norm, so they do not affect the vanishing theorem and the no-ghost theorem. 


The coset can also be written in terms of the Verma modules . For representations , this is possible if the spin  satisfies the bound bound1 . If the Virasoro primary  is at grade  of ,



&=& -j(j-1) k-2 +M+m^2 k +


&=& 2j(k/2-j) k(k-2) +2M k (k 2 -j)+2j k (-j+m+M)+1 k (j-m)^2+>0

since , , , , and . Here, the bound  comes from the  Clebsh-Gordon decomposition: the spin at grade  is from  to . Note that  here is the total -value, not the -value for . The weight  is non-negative because the coset is unitary under the bound.

(ii) Flowed representations:  The discussion for the flowed representations  and  is similar. For the flowed representations, 

0  &=& 0  -w 3 0 -k 4  w^2, 

0  &=& 0  - 0  = L _0^K .


The  CFT can be written in terms of the Verma modules since

= - m^2 k  = -(m +k 2 w)^2 k  0.

Again the  state may be problematic, but one can check that there is no  on-shell state except the ground state. 

The coset can also be written in terms of the Verma modules since 

= -j (j -1) k-2 +M +m ^2 k +>0

for  and

= s ^2+1 4  k-2 +M +m ^2 k +>0

for .






The no-ghost theorem for  


 
 
















Strategy to prove the no-ghost theorem. The traces "" and "" are taken over the observable Hilbert space and the Hilbert space , respectively. The operator  gives eigenvalues  and  counts the total grades.  The no-ghost theorem reduces a calculations of weighted characters modulo the on-shell condition.  


In order to show the no-ghost theorem, the notion of signature  is useful. For a vector space  with an inner product, we can choose a basis  such that

where . Then, the signature of  is defined as
. If , all the  are 1, so  has positive definite norm. Then, the statement of the no-ghost theorem is equivalent to 

tr _   q^-L_0 ^mass   C = tr _   q^-L_0 ^mass  ,

where , the trace "" is taken over the observable Hilbert space, and the operator  gives eigenvalues . Here,  is the "mass" term in  ,i.e. , the -eigenvalue for the ground state [ for the flat spacetime and  for ]. Using the on-shell condition

L_0    = (L_0 ^mass +)   = 0

( counts the total grades.), Eq. noghost1  becomes

tr _   q^  C = tr _   q^ .

Equation noghost2  can be shown with 3 steps (noghost ). This has been done repeatedly for  in Refs. . 

Step 2.1 and 2.2 make use of the BRST quartet mechanism and Step 2.1 uses the vanishing theorem  as well. Step 2.3 can be done by explicitly calculating the both sides. Once one establishes the vanishing theorem, the only nontrivial step is Step 2.3, i.e. , to show
 
Note that the trace weighted by  is an index . 

For the  case, we also make use of closely related quantities: 

tr   q^  C, tr   q^  (-)^ ,

where the trace "" is taken over the Hilbert space . These are essentially weighted characters of the Virasoro algebra. The difference between  and  is that the latter does not impose the on-shell condition. 





Flat spacetime or  cases 


In standard proofs, one explicitly computes the timelike, longitudinal oscillator parts and the  ghosts part. Then, one gets

tr _H    q^  C
= tr _H    q^  (-)^ 
= tr _H _K    q^0 -1 .

This also shows the equivalence with the light-cone spectra.



 cases 


In our previous papers, we pointed out that the standard proof is also valid for  by computing the  part and the  ghosts part if the vanishing theorem is valid for . Then, one gets

tr _H    q^  C
= tr _H    q^  (-)^ 
&=& q^-1  _m  (1-q^m )  tr _H _K    q^0  


&=& ()  tr _H _K    q^0 - 24  ,

where  is the Dedekind eta function.



 

In general, the computation of the index and signature may not be easy and one needs to take an orthonormal basis for the signature. However, for the  case, the  part is written in terms of a free CFT and the coset is unitary just like . Then, the situation is the same as the  case and the computation is essentially the same. Thus, we only discuss  some minor complications specific to .










The Hilbert space consists of a sum of Verma modules of the form basis . We consider the index and the signature for each Verma module with given  and . Only positive  is considered since the no-ghost theorem is expected to hold only for this case. The following basis is taken for Step 2.3:
 
 part: 
The coset part: the basis basis , which is further diagonalized (although we do not have to compute it explicitly.)
It is important here that we take the basis basis , not  since  do not commute with . 

First, let us consider the weighted  characters characters . For all the representations we consider, 

q^  (-)^  
= ()  tr _H _K (>0)   q^0 - 24  . 

Here,  is taken over the Hilbert space  with a given . For flowed representations, one had better use  instead of  for the exponent of ; otherwise, powers of  are not directly related to the mass. However, it is sufficient to use  for our purpose. 

The above weighted character character1  takes the trace over , whereas the index noghost3  takes the trace over . Thus, the weighted character does not really represent the dimension of physical space. 
The on-shell condition needs to be imposed in order to get the dimension from Eq. character1 . This gives rise to two issues. First of all, given a series of representations for , the on-shell condition may not be satisfied for all grades. For the flat spacetime, the on-shell condition is always satisfied by choosing momentum  appropriately. However, in general this may not be the case, and this is not the case for . For example, a continuous representation  typically appears only at the ground state  when .






Second, for the discrete series  and , one must impose the bound bound1 .

The bound in turn implies that the grade is bounded above bound_for_grade  from the on-shell condition. 

Thus, the weighted character can be interpreted as the dimension at a particular grade if the grade is consistent with the on-shell condition and the bound. In other words, even though we sum over all the grades in the character, the full spectrum implied from the character does not appear as physical states. However, this is a minor point since weighted characters for  are the same even at this level [See character_equality ].

For the character weighted by , 

q^  C 
= ()  tr _H _K (>0)   q^0 - 24  ,

where we used the unitarity of the  coset for . Thus, 

tr   q^  C = tr   q^  (-)^ .

Then, taking the on-shell condition into account, we established

tr _H    q^  C
        = tr _H    q^  (-)^ .



Note that the timelike direction cancels with one of the FP-ghost contribution in Eq. character1 , but the character still has a factor of . Consequently, the dimension of the physical Hilbert space is smaller than the Hilbert space of  (by the dimension of a nondegenerate  Verma module). This is because null states arise by tensoring the  CFT and . In the OCQ language, this means that the physical spectrum includes neither timelike oscillators nor OCQ-null states and consists only of DDF states (appC ).

One would recognize that the character character1  is in fact part of the full  characters (times the FP-ghost contribution); e.g. , see Appendix B of Ref. 
(Also, see Refs. -.) . One way to obtain the modular invariant partition function from the character is as follows: 
First, sum over the -eigenvalue with weight . The weight is necessary to avoid the divergence which arises due to the infinite degeneracy of zero mode representations. 
Next, take the "diagonal combination" of character with the anti-holomorphic part. Then, sum over all the representations. Finally, take into account the chiral anomaly
(Also, see Refs. .) . The partition function obtained in this way is identical to the one computed for  model, which is expected to be related to the  model by some Euclidean rotation. 



The no-ghost theorem for string theory 

We saw that the vanishing theorem is valid not only for , but also valid as long as the matter part of the Hilbert space  is written as a sum of two Verma modules: 
 
Moreover, the no-ghost theorem is valid for such a Hilbert space as well. To see this, note that the isomorphism verma  works in both directions. In one direction, we can use the isomorphism to write the  Fock space in terms of a Verma module, but given a Hilbert space  in terms of Verma modules as in Eq. hilbert2 , one can take the basis of a nonunitary  free boson  for the  part. Then, the proof of the no-ghost theorem is essentially the same as the  or  case. 

There is one difference however. The computation of the signature assumes that Virasoro primaries  have positive-definite norm. This is trivial for the  case; the Virasoro primaries in this case are just . However, this point is nontrivial in general and one has to check this point separately. This is similar to the requirement in the OCQ that DDF states have positive-definite norm. Thus, we arrives at the following theorem:









 [The no-ghost theorem for string theory]

 is a positive definite space (i) if the matter part of the Hilbert space  is decomposed as in Eq. hilbert ,

and (ii) if the Virasoro primaries  used to construct the  Verma module have positive-definite norm.

Let us expand condition (ii) more (in the OCQ language). If there were a Virasoro primary in the  part other than a ground state, it would imply that the primary is the Virasoro primary under the full Virasoro algebra. The only case that this is not a OCQ-physical state is when this is a null state, but we assume that there is no such null state in condition (i). Then, the timelike direction is not decoupled and there is a physical state with the timelike polarization. This does not necessarily mean that the theory is problematic. However, if the norm of such a Virasoro primary is not positive-definite, it would imply the violation of the no-ghost theorem. 

It is instructive to see backgrounds with ghosts  and see how these backgrounds violate the assumptions of our no-ghost theorem. 

The Lorentzian orbifold  is an example. In certain cases, this example contains ghosts, so our no-ghost theorem should not apply. This example does not satisfy our no-ghost theorem partly because it violates condition (ii) of no-ghost . 

They consider the spacetime under the following action (For simplicity, consider the bosonic string.):

X^a -X^a (a=0,,d ), X^i X^i (i=d +1, , 25)

They found a ghost when  and we focus on these cases. In the twisted sector,  are antiperiodic; so there is no momentum  and the zero-point energy is shifted. Thus,

&=& 1 16  + M >0, 

&=& (k^i)^2 +d  16  + M' >0,

where Virasoro primaries  are assumed to be at grade , respectively. Thus, the matter Hilbert space is not decomposed as in Eq. hilbert , but one can still form the  Hilbert space by Verma modules since the resulting Kac determinant has no zeros. In fact, the character for the  twisted sector is decomposed in terms of a free boson character :

_c=1,h=1 16  (q) 
&=& q^1 48  _m=1 ^  (1-q^m-1 2  )^-1  


&=& q^1 16   ()^-1  
	_n=1 ^  q^n(n-1) 4   


&=& q^1 16   ()^-1  
	(1 + q^1 2   + q^3 2   + ).
	
However, the  Hilbert space does not satisfy the condition (ii) of no-ghost . For example, the Hilbert space contains a Verma module constructed from a Virasoro primary  and this gives rise to negative-norm states. [The primary corresponds to the  term in Eq. z_2character .] 

Also, one can write each  Verma module in terms of a free boson basis, but the resulting free boson basis is unitary since the  part has positive . (The nonunitarity of the model comes from the nonunitarity of the Virasoro primaries.) The weighted characters for this background characters  are not the same due to these two reasons.

Fortunately, for the Lorentzian orbifold, both  and  are positive so that there is only finite number of on-shell states; physical spectrum can be computed explicitly and there is no ghost when . 



 

BRST-OCQ equivalence 

For string theory on curved backgrounds, one often uses the OCQ. The purpose of this section is to establish the connection between the BRST quantization discussed here and the OCQ. The BRST-OCQ equivalence is well-established for the flat case. When the background is curved, the equivalence may not hold although it is certainly likely. Here, we prove the BRST-OCQ equivalence for the backgrounds where no-ghost  hold. We sketch the standard textbook proof emphasizing the necessary assumptions and the differences from the standard case. As is clear from below, the proof requires the following assumptions:
  

The BRST version of the no-ghost theorem
For each physical state, there is an equivalent class where the FP-ghost sector is in ghost vacuum .


What we have to show is that there is a map which maps the OCQ equivalence classes to the BRST equivalence classes, and the map is both one-to-one and onto. Let  be a state in the matter Hilbert space of the OCQ. Associate a state 

,  

from the Hilbert space in the BRST quantization. Then, the proof consists of 4 steps. 

 
Step 1:
OCQ physical state  BRST closed state  

Show that each OCQ physical state maps to a BRST-closed state. This follows from

Q ,   = _n=0 ^  c_-n  (n  - _n ) ,  .



Step 2:
Equivalent OCQ states  Equivalent BRST states  

Show that if  and  are equivalent OCQ physical states, they map into the same BRST class:

, -= Q  . 

The state is a BRST-closed state from Step 1 and has a zero norm since  is OCQ-null. From the no-ghost theorem (BRST), a zero-norm closed state must be exact. So, this step uses the no-ghost theorem.

Step 3:
The map is one-to-one, i.e. , Equivalent OCQ states  Equivalent BRST states. 

The converse to Step 2. Show that  is OCQ null if Eq. equiv  holds. One expands  in terms of excitations over the ghost ground state, substitute it into Eq. equiv , and compare the both sides. 


Step 4:
The map is onto.  

Show that every BRST class contains at least one state of the form ghost_ground . In our case, this follows from the FP-ghost decoupling theorem (decoupling ).

We have therefore established the no-ghost theorem in the OCQ, for the backgrounds which satisfy no-ghost , in particular for . In fact, one can actually show the no-ghost theorem in the OCQ directly under the same assumption as the BRST quantization. Specifically, as discussed in appC , the proof requires that 
 
[] The Hilbert space is written as in Eq. hilbert .

This assumption is the same as ours.

We assume that the total  of the theory is given by 






L_m  = m  + m  _m   + m . 

We assume that  is a unitary CFT and all states in  lie in highest weight representations. 

The ghost number operator  is normalized so that  since the ghost zero modes will not matter to our discussion.

We will call the total Hilbert space , but it is useful to define the following subspaces:
 
The physical state conditions are

Q phys   = 0, b_0  phys   = 0, L_0  phys   = 0.

Thus, we will consider the cohomology on ;  takes  into itself. The Hilbert space  is classified according to mass eigenvalues. The on-shell condition is written as

L_0    = (L_0 ^mass +)   = 0,

where  is the "mass" term in  ,i.e. , the -eigenvalue for the ground state [ for the flat spacetime and  for ], and  counts the total grade.

Decompose the BRST operator  in terms of ghost zero modes:

Q = + (terms in  with ghost zero modes ).
        
Then, for a state ,
 
Therefore, the physical state condition reduces to
 
Also,  on  from Eq. relative . Thus,  defines a BRST complex, which is called the relative  BRST complex. So, we can define  by
 
and define the relative BRST cohomology of  by
 





The no-ghost theorem in the OCQ:  and  cases 

Here, we sketch the proof for  and  in the old covariant quantization. This has been done in Refs. . The original proof of Goddard-Thorn itself does not hold for these cases, but one can extend to this case via minor modifications. We first give the general strategy in general  which consists of 3 steps, then discuss the flat spacetime,  case, , general case separately in examples .


General strategy 

 

Step 1:
The states of the form

-m_1  -m_2  K_-n_1  K_-n_2  f ,

form a complete basis of the Hilbert space , where

K_n f  = n  f  = 0 (n 1).

Here,  is the generalization of DDF states and  is the generalization of the light-cone operator in Goddard-Thorn's proof. We thus choose  which are nondegenerate and satisfy

[K_m, n ]=m K_m+n .


However, we do not impose  unlike Goddard-Thorn's proof. Also, suppose that  is known to be unitary.

The outline of the proof: 
The proof begins with mapping the above states to the states of the form 

-m_1  -m_2  K_-n_1  K_-n_2  f ,

where .  contains the timelike part and defines a nonunitary  CFT.  defines a Virasoro algebra with . Then, the proof uses the fact that the Kac determinant for  is nonvanishing for . Note that this basis of the Hilbert space OCQ_basis2  is basically the same as the one in the BRST quantization basis .

Step 2:
From Step 1, a physical state  can be written as 

  = s  + k .

 is a spurious state and  is a state with no 's. If  is physical, then  and  are physical as well. A consequence is that  is a null state and .

The outline of the proof: 
The proof directly follows from Goddard-Thorn's proof.

Step 3:
If  is physical, then . Thus,

   = k   = f  .

So, the space of physical states is unitary if  is unitary.

The outline of the proof: 
The proof uses the isomorphism of  with a  Verma modules and that the Kac determinant for  is nonvanishing for . Since the Kac determinant is nonvanishing, there is no Virasoro primaries in the Verma modules other than . 




Examples 

 

[] Flat spacetime or  case: 
Originally, Goddard and Thorn choose

K_n = k_0 _n ,

where  is a light-cone vector. Then, one can immediately conclude that  after Step 2 from  and . However, one needs  to define .

[]  case: 
As pointed out in Refs. , one can alternatively choose

K_n = ^0 _n .

Then,  do not commute, but Step 3 assures . 

[] : 

One can choose

K_n = 3 n .



For the discrete representation  and their flowed representations , Step 1 to 3 follow with the bound on the spin  bound1  since  only within the bound. On the other hand, for the continuous representations , this condition on the weight is always valid.

Note that  by construction, so  is a subspace of the coset . The coset has been shown to be unitary within the bound of  in Ref. . 

[] General cases: 
As one can see, the proof is equally valid as long as one can isolate the timelike part as a  CFT, and if the basis of the Hilbert space  is written as in Eq. OCQ_basis2  or a sum of two Verma modules:

H _,  = V (<0) V (>0).

Note that this is the same as the requirement in the BRST quantization hilbert . In general, the operator  can be constructed by choosing a free boson basis due to the isomorphism verma .
