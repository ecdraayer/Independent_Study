We compute the  correction to the Casimir
energy for the massive  model
confined between a pair of parallel plates. The calculations
are made with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.
The correction is shown to be sensitive to the boundary conditions,
except in the zero mass limit, in which case our results
agree with those found in the literature.















Since the publication of Casimir's paper in 1948 
 on the 
attraction of two neutral, parallel and  perfectly conducting 
plates (an effect that bears his name since then), a lot of work 
on this subject has been done.
However, the great majority of papers 
concerning the Casimir effect found in literature deals with 
non-interacting fields. Quite a few papers are 
devoted to radiative corrections to the Casimir effect
(in the context of QED, see;
in the context of the  theory, see
). For 
free fields, the Casimir energy is given only by the zero-point 
energy of the field, properly regularized and renormalized. 
Hence, different boundary conditions leading to the 
same eigenfrequencies yield the same Casimir energy. In other 
words, at one-loop level the Casimir effect is sensitive to
the eigenfrequencies, but blind to the eigenmodes. An interesting
question is whether this peculiarity 
is maintained if radiative corrections are 
taken into account. In the case of a massless scalar field with 
a quartic self-interaction confined between a pair of parallel plates, 
it has been shown that the first order radiative correction to
the Casimir energy is the same for Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions
. 
However, it is not clear whether this is also true in the case
of a massive scalar field or is a peculiarity of the massless field.
Even for the massless scalar field, it is not obvious whether this property will persist 
at higher orders in the coupling constant.
The purpose of this work is to investigate the former question, namely,
what is the effect of the mass on the first order radiative correction to the Casimir
energy of a self-interacting scalar field
confined between a pair of parallel plates.

We shall consider in this paper the massive 
model in four-dimensional space-time.
It is defined by the Euclidean Lagrangian 
density(Conventions: , .) 

 

where  contains the usual renormalization counterterms.
The system is confined between two parallel plates, located at
the planes  and , where the field is submitted to one
of the following boundary conditions:

 
Dirichlet boundary conditions (DD):

 

Neumann boundary conditions (NN):

 


In the noninteracting case (i.e., ), 
the Casimir energy per unit
of area is the same for both kinds of boundary 
conditions: 

 

Using perturbation theory, one obtains for the  correction 
to the above result the following expression:

 

where  is the Green's function of the free theory (i.e.,
with , but obeying the boundary conditions),
 is the radiatively induced shift in the mass parameter,
and  is the shift in the cosmological constant (i.e.,
the change in the vacuum energy which is due solely to the
interaction, and not to the confinement).

In the spectral representation, the Green's function in -dimensional
space-time is given by

 

with

 

 diverges when  for , therefore a regularization
prescription is needed in order to make sense of . We shall
compute it using dimensional regularization; the result is

 

where

 

Now we can compute the terms appearing in Eq. ():

 

 

where  in the DD case, and  in the NN case.

Collecting terms, we obtain

 

where  is defined as

 

The identity
 

where  denotes the modified Bessel function, provides
the analytic extension of  to ,
with simple poles at 

Let us now fix the renormalization conditions for 
 and .
To do so, let us consider the self-energy . In first order 
in perturbation theory it is given by

 

 will be fixed by imposing the following conditions 
on : (i) that  (except possibly
at some special points), and (ii) that  vanishes
away from the plates when , i.e.,

 

besides, we shall require that  be independent
of . These conditions are fulfilled by taking
, where  denotes the free Green's 
function without boundary conditions  evaluated at the point .
(This is most easily seen in the multiple reflection representation
of the Green's function , in which Eq. () becomes

 

where the  sign corresponds to the NN(DD) case.) Computing
 within dimensional regularization, we explicitly
obtain

 

For the shift in the cosmological constant we shall take

 

With this choice one eliminates the terms proportional to  in 
Eqs. () and (), which do not contribute
to the force between the plates (the linear dependence on  is canceled
by similar terms when one adds the energy of the regions 
and ).

Inserting Eqs. (), (), and () 
into Eqs. () and (), we obtain

 


 

We can now take , obtaining

 


 


It follows froms Eqs. () and ()
that  in three-dimensional space;
equality is attained only in the massless case, in which case one
recovers the results of Ref. :(In order 
to take the limit  in Eqs. () and (),
we have used the following expansion, valid for small :




) 

 

It is also interesting to note that, while  is a
monotonically decreasing function of ,  first
decreases and then eventually increases with . Indeed, 
Eq. () is also valid for fixed  and ; on the other hand,
for  Eqs. () and ()
yield

 


Results for other kinds of boundary conditions (DN,
periodic, and anti-periodic) will be presented elsewhere.
