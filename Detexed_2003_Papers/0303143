Non-commutative Chern-Simons, Matrix Model Theory,
Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) Fluids 
 


Introduction 










Recently, Susskind  showed that an Abelian
non-commutative Chern-Simons theory at level  is actually
equivalent to Laughlin theory :
 
where the star-product is the usual Moyal product with parameter
. Therefore, he obtained the filling factor
 

He also pointed out that the above theory can be formulated in terms
of a matrix model involving classical Hermitian matrix variables
, .  The Lagrangian for the matrix theory is
 
 is the magnetic field. The equation of motion for the coordinate
 (Gauss law constraint) is
 
which can only be solved if the matrices are infinite dimensional.
This corresponds to an infinite number of electrons on an infinite
plane.

For a finite system, Polychronakos  has introduced an
additional set of bosonic degrees of freedom , ,
such that ,
 
Considering , Polychronakos  found a quantum
correction to Susskinds filling factor such that
 
In this case, the Gauss law constraint becomes
 

Later Hellerman and Van Raamsdonk  built the
corresponding wavefunctions for ,
 
where  is the fully antisymmetric tensor.
These are similar to Laughlins wavefunction .
Subsequently, three of us generalised  the above results
to any filling factor given by
 

In what follows, we propose a matrix model to describe such FQH states
that are not of Laughlin type.

 fractional quantum Hall states 

Although the  FQH state is not of the Laughlin type,
it shares some basic features of Laughlin fluids. The point is that
from the standard definition of the filling factor 
, the state  can naively be
thought of as corresponding to  where the
number  of flux quanta is given by a fractional amount of
the electron number; that is
 
In fact this way of viewing things reflects the original idea of a
hierarchical construction of FQH states for general filling factor
.  In Haldane's hierarchy , the elements of
the series
 
correspond to taking  as given by a specific rational
factor of the electron number, i.e.,
 
Upon setting 
 
we have
.
For , e.g.,
 

Matrix model analysis 

To describe FQH fluids at , we consider the following
action for a system of  particles  
where , , 
 and  the gauge for the th particle.  The
 and  currents (Gauss law
constraints) read as
 
where the two  charge operators  and 
are
 

The wavefunctions  describing the 
system of electrons on the non-commutative plane 
 with filling factor  should obey the
constraint       
Once we know the fundamental state 
, excitations are immediately
determined by applying the usual rules. Upon recalling the coordinate
operators as
  
the total Hamiltonian  may be treated as the sum of a free
part given by
 
where 
 and 
 are the operator
numbers counting the  and  particles respectively, and an
interacting part
 
describing couplings between the two sectors  .
The creation and annihilation operators 
, , and  satisfy the
Heisenberg algebra
 
all others are given by commuting relations.  


Wavefunctions 
A way to build the
spectrum of the Hamiltonian  is given by help of the
special condensate operators
 
The wavefunctions for the vacuum  of  read as
 
where the 's are building blocks and given by
 



The corresponding energy spectrum 
is
 

Note that for large value of  and  ,
 behaves quadratically in ,
 
This energy relation is less than the total energy
 of the decoupled configuration 
:
 
Therefore, we have the following relation
 

For the example of the FQH state at , the energy of
the decoupled representation reads as
 
while that of the interacting one is 
 
leading to
 


Conclusion 

We have developed a matrix model for FQH states at filling factor
 going beyond the Laughlin theory. To illustrate our
idea, we have considered an FQH system of a finite number
 of electrons with filling factor
; 
 is an odd integer and  is an even integer.  The
 series corresponds just to the level two of the
Haldane hierarchy; it recovers the Laughlin series 
 by going to the limit  large and contains
several observable FQH states such as
