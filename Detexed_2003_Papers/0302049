We describe the supergravity solutions dual to D6-branes with both time-dependent
and time-independent -fields. These backgrounds generalize the
Taub-NUT metric in two key ways: they have asymmetric warp factors and
background fluxes. In the time-dependent case,
the warping takes a novel form. Kaluza-Klein reduction
in these backgrounds is unusual, and we explore some of the new
features. In particular, we describe how a localized
gauge-field emerges with an analogue of the open string metric and
coupling. We also describe a gravitational analogue of the
Seiberg-Witten map. This provides
a framework in supergravity both for
studying non-commutative gauge theories, and for constructing novel
warped backgrounds.





Introduction 

The aim of this paper is to generalize the correspondence between
D6-branes and multi-Taub-NUT metrics . The case
of particular interest to us is a D6-brane with NS-NS
-fields along certain directions of its world-volume. 
The type IIA
geometry describing the back reaction of these branes has been studied
in , and for massive type
IIA in . For a
particular choice of low-energy fields, the
world-volume theory is a supersymmetric non-commutative Yang-Mill
theory . On the other hand, the M theory
description of this background is a warped geometry with fluxes that
preserves one-half of the supersymmetries. For certain choices of
-field, this background appeared
in . Our approach differs from the AdS/CFT
style approach
of   because we expect to see
a non-commutative gauge-field
directly in
our Kaluza-Klein spectrum. While it might be possible to see this
singlet field in the gravity dual of
lower-dimensional branes, the zero-mode analysis looks
harder . 


We
will also consider branes with time-dependent fluxes of the kind
described in , and studied
in related work . 
The world-volume theory is a
non-commutative gauge theory, but with a time-dependent
non-commutativity parameter .
In these cases, the solution is warped in an unusual way not seen in
the string compactifications studied to date. We will see that the
metric for the internal  space is also warped with a time-dependent
scale factor. A priori, it would have been hard to imagine that this
kind of solution could give rise to localized degrees of freedom. Yet the
existence of a brane dual suggests that this is indeed the case. 
The form of this solution also suggests the existence of a
far larger class of compactifications where the
internal space modulates in a time-dependent way. This direction will be 
investigated elsewhere . 


In the following section, we begin by obtaining the explicit
metrics and fluxes corresponding to the M theory duals of
D6-branes with time-independent fluxes. In section three, we repeat
this analysis for the case of D6-branes with time-dependent
fluxes. This gives us solutions with explicit time-dependent
warping. 

In the final section, we investigate the new issues
that arise in determining the
Kaluza-Klein spectrum for asymmetrically warped metrics of this
kind. In particular, we find that fluctuations of the metric and
-form necessarily couple in these backgrounds. We show this in
two ways: first, by
a direct analysis of small fluctuations around the warped
background. Second, by a duality chasing argument. One of our main
goals in this investigation was to see how the non-commutative gauge
group arises from supergravity. This coupling of fluctuations makes it
clear that a
class of gravity gauge transformations constitute part of the gauge
theory symmetry
group.  We also explicitly find the harmonic 
-forms on these spaces which play a key role in giving rise to space-time
gauge-fields. The couplings and metrics are deformed from the values
we expect for closed strings toward the values we expect for open
strings. 

While we see a good deal of evidence for the emergence of
non-commutative gauge symmetry in our Kaluza-Klein analysis, our
account from a direct small fluctuation analysis is still incomplete. Our duality
chasing argument suggests that the Seiberg-Witten map between
commutative and non-commutative variables map  
should follow naturally from T-duality! Indeed, we are able to obtain
this map from gravity to quadratic order in the gauge-fields. Our
analysis is really a natural extension of the argument by
Cornalba  (see, also )
to gravity. Using similar
reasoning, it should be possible to describe, in a uniform way, the coupling of the
supergravity multiplet to non-commutative gauge-fields. 
There is also a great deal more to be understood about
the time-dependent case. We should also point out that our
results have interesting implications for the geometric approach to
computing the NS 5-brane partition sum studied in . 
Lastly, we note that asymmetrically warped backgrounds have been
considered recently in string theory , and in non-stringy
settings .  


Black Branes and T-duality 
The smeared 5-brane solution 

Our starting point for most of the following discussion is the smeared black 5-brane
solution of IIB supergravity.  It can be obtained, for example, by T-dualizing
a spherically symmetric (in the transverse directions) 6-brane solution along
the brane.  The 5-brane solution is determined by the following dilaton,
, R-R potentials, , and metric:
e^2  &=& g_s^2 H^-1  

ds^2 &=& H^- (-dx_0^2 + + dx_5^2 ) + H^(dx_6^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d_2^2 ) 

C_6 &=& g_s^-1 c r H^-1 dx_0 dx_5 

C_2 &=& g_s^-1 cdx_6 dwhere
H = 1 + c r 
and  is a constant chosen to give the correct value for the 5-brane charge,
i.e. so that
1 (2_s)^2 __  dC_2 =
1 (2_s)^2 __  dC_6 = Q_5
where  is the space transverse to the brane (parametrized by ,
, , and ).  For example, if  is compact with radius ,
then  is , then we find
c = g_s _s^2 R Q_5. 
In other cases this may be modified, as we shall see.  We will always
consider a single brane, so that .

We now proceed to generate some new solutions from this starting point.  Our
main tools are T-duality and lifting to M-theory. We outline our
conventions in Appendix .

The usual story 

It is useful for us to begin with a brief discussion of the standard story
which we plan to generalize.  Typically, one starts with a spherically
symmetric 6-brane, but for practice,  we will instead T-dualize our smeared
5-brane along .  If  is taken to have radius , we obtain:
e^2  &=& g_s ^2 H^-3 2   

ds^2 &=& H^- (-dx_0^2 + + dx_5^2 + dx_6^2 ) + H^(dr^2 + r^2 d_2^2 ) 

C_7 &=& g_s ^-1 c r H^-1 dx_0 dx_5 dx_6 

C_1 &=& -g_s ^-1 cdwhere  and  is given by eqs. () and
().  Gratifyingly, it is the 6-brane solution that we expect.

Now lifting to 11D (with  for simplicity) we obtain:
TN 
ds^2 = -dx_0^2 + + dx_6^2 + H(dr^2 + r^2 d^2 ) +
H^-1 (dy + cd)^2. 
This solution corresponds to a KK monopole solution, with space-time
metric , where  is the Taub-NUT
manifold.

The twisted compactification 

We will now generalize this solution to the case where the D6-brane
supports a rank 2 NS-NS -field. Let us outline the steps:
our starting point is a D5-brane oriented along
 and delocalised along  (this is essentially T-dual
to a D6-brane oriented along  and localised at a point 
in ). The directions  form a square torus. We then 
twist  the directions in such a way that a 
second T-duality along the
delocalised  direction gives a D6-brane with a non-trivial -field 
along . We then lift this configuration to M theory where we
obtain a warped analogue of the Taub-NUT metric of TN   with 4-form
-fluxes. As a matter of notation, note that  where
 is the -dimensional supergravity potential. This will be the
solution that should give rise to a
non-commutative gauge-field. Let us give a detailed analysis of this procedure now.   

Starting with the solution from
section , we make
a change of coordinates (found in):
z_1 &=& x_5 - x_6 

z_2 &=& x_6 R , 
or inverting,
x_5 &=& z_1 + Rz_2 

x_6 &=& Rz_2. 
We take  to be compact with unit radius.  In these variables the
5-brane solution becomes
ds^2 &=& H^- (-dx_0^2 + + dx_4^2 + ^2 dz_1^2
+ 2Rdz_1 dz_2 + R^2 (1 + c r ^2 )dz_2^2
) 

&& + H^(dr^2 + r^2 d_2^2 ) 

C_6 &=& g_s^-1 c r H^-1 dx_0 dx_4 (dz_1 +
Rdz_2 ) 

C_2 &=& g_s^-1 Rcdz_2 d. 




After T-dualizing along , we find
e^2  &=& g_s ^2 H_1^- H_2^-1  

ds^2 &=& H_1^- (-dx_0^2 + dx_4^2 ) +
H_1^H_2^-1 (dz_1^2 + dz_2^2 ) + H_1^(dr^2 +
r^2 d_2^2 ) 

B_2 &=& H_2^-1  dz_1 dz_2 

C_7 &=& g_s ^-1 R' 2r H_2^-1  dx_0 dx_4 dz_1 dz_2 

C_5 &=& g_s ^-1 R' 2r H_1^-1 dx_0 dx_4


C_3 &=& g_s ^-1 R'H_2^-1 dz_1 dz_2 d

C_1 &=& -g_s ^-1 R'dwhere we have defined
g_s &=& _s R g_s 

R' &=& g _s _s 
 
H_1 &=& 1 + R' 2r  

H_2 &=& 1 + R' 2r  and have scaled  so that it has the natural T-dual radius of
.  The constant  in () has been fixed in
() and () by computing .

If we now set  and lift to M theory we obtain the solution:
ds^2 &=& H_1^-1 3  H_2^1 3  (-dx_0^2 + +
dx_4^2 ) + H_1^2 3  H_2^-2 3  (dz_1^2 +
dz_2^2 ) + H_1^2 3  H_2^1 3  (dr^2 +
r^2 d_2^2 ) 

&& + H_1^-1 3  H_2^-2 3  (dy +
R'd)^2 

A_3 &=& H_2^-1 dz_1 dz_2 (dy + R'd). 
Note that the 3-form has a non-trivial field strength with  legs in
the direction of  and 2 legs along the internal space. 

Let us make the map between parameters explicit. Viewing the type IIA
configuration as our starting point, we began 
with a solution whose parameters are , , and the angle
 which determines the strength of the -field via 
B_2(r=)-B_2(r=0) = dz_1 dz_2. 
Our derivation of the IIA
supergravity solution led to a  which vanished at the origin, but shifting
 by any constant 2-form also satisfies the equations of motion.  When we
lift to 11 dimensions, we have new parameters , , and the
strengh of the 3-form, .  In terms of the IIA parameters, the relation is
R_11  &=& g_s _s 

_p &=& g_s^1 3   _s 

A_z_1 z_2 y () - A_z_1 z_2 y (0) &=& . Generalizing to higher rank -fields 

It is a simple matter to repeat the analysis above with additional twisted
compactifications, obtaining supergravity solutions corresponding to
-fields of rank 4 or 6.

In the rank 4 case, one starts with a black 4-brane smeared in two directions
and performs two sets of coordinate redefinitions and T-dualities to obtain the
following black 6-brane configuration with flux:
e^2  &=& g_s ^2 H_0^H_1^-1 H_2^-1  

ds^2 &=& H_0^- (-dx_0^2 + dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 ) +
H_0^H_1^-1 (dz_3^2 + dz_4^2 ) + H_0^H_2^-1 (dz_5^2
+ dz_6^2 ) 

&& + H_0^(dr^2 + r^2 d_2^2 ) 

B_2 &=& H_1^-1  _1 dz_3 dz_4 + H_2^-1  _2 dz_5 dz_6


C_7 &=& g_s ^-1 R' 2r H_0 H_1^-1 H_2^-1  dx_0 dx_1 dx_2 dz_3 dz_4 dz_5 dz_6 

C_5 &=& g_s ^-1 R' 2r H_1^-1 _2 dx_0 dx_1 dx_2
dz_3 dz_4 

&& + g_s ^-1 R' 2r H_2^-1 _1 dx_0 dx_1 dx_2 dz_5 dz_6 

C_3 &=& -g_s ^-1 R' 2r H_0^-1 _1 _2 dx_0 dx_1 dx_2 

&& + g_s ^-1 R'H_1^-1 _1 dz_3 dz_4 d+
g_s ^-1 R'H_2^-1 _2 dz_5 dz_6 d

C_1 &=& -g_s ^-1 R'd. We have defined
g_s &=& g_s _s^2 R_4 R_6  

H_0 &=& 1 + R' 2r_1 _2  

H_1 &=& 1 + R'_1 2r_2  

H_2 &=& 1 + R'_2 2r_1 . The lift to M theory has the form (again setting )
ds^2 &=& H_0^-2 3  H_1^1 3  H_2^1 3  (-dx_0^2 +
dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 ) + H_0^1 3  H_1^-2 3  H_2^1 3 
(dz_3^2 + dz_4^2 ) 

&& + H_0^1 3  H_1^1 3  H_2^-2 3  (dz_5^2 + dz_6^2
) + H_0^1 3  H_1^1 3  H_2^1 3  (dr^2 +
r^2 d_2^2 ) 

&& + H_0^1 3  H_1^-2 3  H_2^-2 3  (dy +
R'd)^2 

A_3 &=& -R' 2r H_0^-1 _1 _2 dx_0 dx_1 dx_2 

&& + (H_1^-1 _1 dz_3 dz_4 + H_2^-1 _2 dz_5 dz_6
)(dy + R'd). Similar considerations can be applied to the rank 6 case.  We will
write down only the form of the 11D solution:
ds^2 &=& -H_0^-1 H_1^1 3  H_2^1 3  H_3^1 3  dx_0^2 +
H_1^-2 3  H_2^1 3  H_3^1 3  (dz_1^2 + dz_2^2 )
+ H_1^1 3  H_2^-2 3  H_3^1 3  (dz_3^2 + dz_4^2
) 

&& + H_1^1 3  H_2^1 3  H_3^-2 3   (dz_5^2 +
dz_6^2 ) + H_1^1 3  H_2^1 3  H_3^1 3  (dr^2
+ r^2 d^2 ) 

&& + H_0 H_1^-2 3  H_2^-2 3  H_3^-2 3  (dy +
R'd+ R 2r  H_0^-1  t_1 t_2 t_3 dx_0 )^2 

A_3 &=& R 2r  H_1^-1  t_2 t_3  dx_0 dz_1 dz_2 + R H_1^-1 
t_1 dz_1 w dz_2 d

&& + R 2r  H_2^-1  t_1 t_3  dx_0 dz_3 dz_4 + R H_2^-1 
t_2 dz_3 w dz_4 d

&& + R 2r  H_3^-1  t_1 t_2  dx_0 dz_5 dz_6 + R H_3^-1 
t_3 dz_5 w dz_6 d

with
H_0 &=& 1 + R' 2rc_1 c_2 c_3  

H_1 &=& 1 + R'c_1 2rc_2 c_3  

H_2 &=& 1 + R'c_2 2rc_1 c_3  

H_3 &=& 1 + R'c_3 2rc_1 c_2 . 

and where  and .  Note the
appearance of a cross term in the metric between  and .  This is a
consequence of the fact that a D6-brane with a rank 6 -field induces a
non-zero  field (said differently, the D6-brane with a rank 6  carries
D0-brane charge).  This  lifts to become the off-diagonal metric terms
seen above.

Time-Dependent Cases 

Another new solution can be obtained by performing the null-brane
quotient  on
the D5-brane, with the parabolic quotient acting along the brane (in directions ,
, and ), and the shift direction transverse ().  We
recall that the null-brane quotient acts by
&x^+ &x^+ 

&x^- &x^- + 2x + 2^2 x^+ 

&x &x + 2x^+ 

&z &z + 2R. Now let us switch to the natural invariant coordinates:
&x^- &= x^- - z R  x + z^2 2R^2  x^+ 

&x &= x - z R  x^+ 

&z &= z R . In these coordinates, the quotient action is simply .

In terms of these invariant coordinates (for simplicity, we will drop
the tildes from now on), the smeared 5-brane is given by
e^2  &=& g_s H^-1  

ds^2 &=& H^- (-2dx^+ dx^- - 2xdx^+ dz + dx^2 + 2x^+ dxdz +
(x^+)^2dz^2 + dx_3^2 + dx_4^2 + dx_5^2 )

&& + H^(R^2 dz^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d_2^2 )

C_6 &=& -g_s^-1 c r H^-1 dx^+ (dx^- dx + x^+ dx^- dz -
xdxdz)dx_3 dx_4 dx_5 

C_2 &=& g_s^-1 Rcdz d, where,
H = 1 + c r ,
and  is the same as the case of an ordinary compact direction (see equation
()).

Next, we T-dualize along .  We obtain a solution for a D6-brane with
 flux:
e^2  &=& g_s ^2 H^- h^-1  

ds^2 &=& H^- (-2dx^+ dx^- + dx_3^2 + dx_4^2 + dx_5^2 )
+ H^h^-1 (dx^2 + dz^2 ) 

&& + H^(dr^2 + r^2 d_2^2 ) +
H^- h^-1 R^-2 (-x^2 (dx^+)^2 + 2x^+ xdx^+ dx) 

B_2 &=& h^-1 R^-1 (-xdx^+ + x^+ dx)dz 

C_7 &=& -g_s ^-1 c r h^-1 dx^+ dx^- dxdx_3 dx_4 dx_5 dz 

C_5 &=& g_s ^-1 R^-1 c r H^-1 dx^+ (x^+ dx^- -
xdx)dx_3 dx_4 dx_5 

C_3 &=& g_s ^-1 R^-1 ch^-1 (-xdx^+ + x^+ dx)dzd

C_1 &=& -g_s ^-1 cd. We have defined
g_s = _s R g_s
which is the value of , and
h = 1 + c r  + (x^+ R )^2
and where we have again rescaled  so that it has the natural T-dual radius
.

Note that as , we have , , and the solution
reduces to that of a standard spherically symmetric black 6-brane, as expected.

Finally, we would like to lift this configuration to M-theory.  We set
 to avoid cluttering the formulae:
ds^2 &=& H^-1 3  h^1 3  (-2dx^+ dx^- + dx_3^2 + dx_4^2
+ dx_5^2 ) + H^2 3  h^-2 3  (dx^2 + dz^2 )


&&  + H^-1 3  h^-2 3  R^-2 (-x^2 (dx^+)^2 +
2x^+ xdx^+ dx)+ H^2 3  h^1 3  (dr^2 + r^2 d^2 +
r^2 ^2 d^2 ) 

&& + H^-1 3  h^-2 3  (dy +
cd)^2 

A_3 &=& -R^-1 h^-1 (-xdx^+ + x^+ dx)dz(dy +
cd). As a simple check on the algebra, we note that the equation of motion for
the M theory 3-form is obeyed; namely that 
 (both sides vanish in this case). This solution can be further
generalized by adding static -fields along various directions of
the D6-brane. 

Kaluza-Klein Reduction 
Some preliminary comments 
The metrics and fluxes obtained in our prior discussion define both M
theory and type IIA compactifications. Our subsequent discussion
assumes an M theory compactification, but similar comments apply to type IIA. 
It is worth first recalling how we obtain localized 7-dimensional modes for
the case of vanilla Taub-NUT. We begin by considering small
fluctuations around our supergravity solution, 




where  parametrizes metric fluctuations, while 
parametrizes 3-form fluctuations. In conventional situations without
background fluxes, the two
fluctuations decouple, and can be analyzed separately. 

So we consider 3-form fluctuations of the form ,
A_3  = A_1 + B_2 , 

with  a 7-dimensional gauge-field, and  a 10-dimensional
2-form. The normalizable closed
2-form  is related to the one-form  by the condition
 
Despite appearances,  is not trivial in cohomology because  is not
normalizable. 
Roughly, reducing on  gives us 10-dimensional propagating fields,
while reducing on  gives 7-dimensional fields. The gauge
invariant field strength then takes the form, 

which agrees with our expectations from string theory.  

The  gauge symmetry 

visible at low-energies arises from the
symmetry

since  


Note that the gauge symmetry of the full theory 
is much larger since the gauged
7-dimensional Poincare group is still unbroken by this
background. However, these two symmetry groups can be considered
separately in the low-energy theory. 

To proceed,  let us actually construct the 2-form , which was found for Taub-NUT
in . We will use the same approach
to find forms on our generalized Taub-NUT metrics.  The space of harmonic
two-forms can be decomposed into two components, each containing either self-dual
or anti-self-dual forms. Topologically, Taub-NUT is equivalent to  so any
closed 2-form  is exact, and can be written in the form
. If  is to be non-trivial then   cannot be normalizable.
Our search therefore reduces to finding
one-forms, , satisfying .  To generalize our
discussion in a way that will be useful later, let us write our
Taub-NUT space in the form
gtn 
ds^2 = G_1 (r)(dr^2 + r^2 d_2^2 ) + G_2 (r)(dy +
d)^2. 
Here we assume that  has periodicity , which means that
 for
the metric gtn . For this metric, we define vierbeins
 . 
We make the following ansatz for the form of 
&=& g(r)(dy + d) 

d&=& g'(r)dr(dy + d) -
g(r)dd

&=& G_1^- G_2^- g'(r)e^r e^y -
 r^2 G_1^-1 g(r)e^e^

d&=& G_1^- G_2^- g'(r)e^e^-
 r^2 G_1^-1 g(r)e^r e^y.  For  to be SD (ASD), we require that  satisfy
g'(r) &=&  r^2 G_1^- G_2^g(r) 

&& g = [^r G_1^-  G_2^  dr r^2 ]. 
To check normalizability, we integrate
-= 2g'(r)g(r)dr d d dy =
8^2 g_s _s . [g(r)]^2 _0^. 
It will turn out that in all of the cases that we consider, the ASD solution
is normalizable, and the SD solution is not.  Also, we will find
that generally , so the above formula reduces to
= 8^2 g_s _s [g()]^2. 
In order to fix the normalization constant, we use the following argument
which appears in. 
The action for a membrane wrapping the directions , , and a transverse
direction should give rise, on reduction along , to the action of an open string
ending on the D6-brane.  The membrane action is
S = _M2 A_3 = g_s^-2 3   (2)^2 _p^3 g'(r)drdy A_1 = g() 2g_s^2 3  _s^2 
A_1
while the open string world-sheet action has a piece
S = _  A_1. 
On comparing these two expressions, we find that , and so
g(r) = 2_p^2 [-_r^G_1^- G_2^dr r^2 ]. 
Returning to the case of standard Taub-NUT, we have  and
.  The integral is particularly simple and gives,
g(r) = 2_p^2 H^-1 . 
Finally, let us see reduce 
part of the 11-dimensional SUGRA action using
.  Ignoring  for the moment, the kinetic term for the 4-form gives
S &=& -1 2_11 ^2 d A_3 _11  d A_3 

&=& -1 2(2)^8 g_s^3 _s^9   g_s^-1   _^6,1   dA_1
_7 dA_1 _TN  _4 

&=& -1 2(2)^4 g_s _s^3 _^6,1   dA_1 _7
dA_1. 
This is the correct 7D YM action with the correct coupling constant, 

Let us imagine, for the moment, that we know the complete
7-dimensional effective action to all orders in . We could now
contemplate moving in the space of SUGRA solutions by turning on a background
. By turning on this background, we reduce the full
 Lorentz group to some subgroup. 
Nevertheless, the low-energy physics should be captured by
the complete effective action which, from string theory, we expect takes the form 
S_eff  = 1 g_s (2)^6 _s^7   d^7x  
   ( 1  + 2_s^2 (F_2+B_2) )    +
O(F_2).    

This is a completely commutative description of the low-energy
physics which has, among other features, linear couplings to the
background .  This is
one way to describe the physics of our warped compactifications, but
it requires knowledge of physics beyond supergravity. We
now turn to a direct analysis of small fluctuations around the warped solutions.  

The static warped case 
Reduction on warped metrics introduces a number of novel issues
to which we now turn. 
Let us begin by overviewing the key features of the supergravity
solutions described earlier.  The D6-brane world-volume
supports a -dimensional abelian gauge-field. We turn on 
an NS-NS -field  along certain directions of the
world-volume. The -field
is characterized by its rank (, , or ). The presence
of the -field explicitly breaks the  Lorentz symmetry to
a subgroup that depends on the rank. The corresponding M theory duals
are the warped metrics of section  which generalize
the Taub-NUT space. 
By a warped metric, we mean
a metric that takes the form:
usual  ds^2 = f(r) ds_space-time ^2 + ds_ ^2. The coordinate  on
which the warp factor  depends is along the compactification space
. We use the term
"compactification" here in an abuse of terminology since  for us is a non-compact
manifold. Nevertheless,  supports normalizable modes which
propagate in space-time.

The -field in type IIA lifts to the 3-form, , with field
strength  in M theory. The second important feature of these
solutions is the presence of  flux. It is typical in
supergravity that warping is accompanied by fluxes. This
complicates a Kaluza-Klein analysis since the metric and -form
modes can mix in a non-trivial way. A discussion of how to find
massless modes in situations like this appears
in , which we will use as a guide. The first
change from the usual case of usual  is that our warping is
asymmetric. Let us parametrize space-time by coordinates 
, and let , for simplicity, be non-vanishing in the 
directions. The metric takes the form, ds^2 = f_1(r) ds^2_
x_0, x_3,x_4,x_5, x_6   + f_2(r) ds^2_ z_1, z_2   +
ds_ ^2. The accompanying M theory  has  legs in the
 directions and  legs in . We want to describe the
localized vector multiplets. More precisely, we want to
describe the leading terms in the action for a fluctuation 
. The leading terms in the action are quadratic in the fluctuation
with all the
background parameters absorbed into the metric on the space of
fluctuations, 

This is quite different from the commutative description of
commDBI  in which the background  appears
explicitly even for the leading terms.
However, this is the usual procedure for determining the
effective action and light degrees of freedom around a given SUGRA
solution. This existence of (at least) two descriptions is very much
along the lines described  in . This approach should,
morally, give
the non-commutative description. If this is true then at least the
coupling constants and metric should be deformed toward the values we
expect for open strings. 

 In the unwarped case, vectors
arose by reducing  on harmonic -forms of . We need to be
more careful here. 
An  fluctuation, , can be written in the form A_3 =
(x) C^(3)  + A_1(x)  C^(2)  + B_2  C^(1) 
where  is an -form on the internal space. The
fields  and  have arbitrary dependence on .
Since we want to consider vectors, let us set  and .
Note that any vector  is automatically part of a
supermultiplet that includes  scalars. These additional scalars
come from metric fluctuations.
Now there is an immediate worry; namely, is  a vector under
 or under ? Since we have broken the symmetry
to  by an explicit , it seems more natural to 
consider an expansion like
generalansatz   A_3 = A_dx^ C^(2) _1 + A_1 dz^1  C^(2) _2 + A_2 dz^2
 C^(2) _3, where  and the  are a priori independent. 
However, this decomposition does not seem natural if we
want to see a gauge symmetry in the effective theory that mixes the
 and  directions. In this case,  for example, both
 and  are needed to give a gauge covariant 
field strength, 
. Another possibility is to insist on an expansion
that involves just field strengths rather than potentials, but that
seems unnatural.  If we want an
expansion in terms of the supergravity potential  rather than the field
strength , it seems more natural to start by considering a fluctuation of the form
A_3 = ( A_dx^+ A_1 dz^1 + A_2 dz^2 )
, where we introduce one internal 2-form . We take this choice
as our starting point, although we will see in
section  that the more general ansatz of generalansatz  is
actually possible. 

The fluctation is expanded in eigenmodes of the equation of motion
 d
*  d A_3 = - G_4 d A_3, where 
denotes the Hodge dual with respect to the warped metric.  
The right hand side of eomC , which comes from the
Chern-Simons interaction

in M theory, is
a  form where  denotes a  form in space-time and
a  form on . Using fluct  which is a  form, we see
that the left hand side of eomC  never gives a  form
so these terms decouple initially. 

The left hand side can be expanded to give, d  *  d
A_3 &=& d* F_2  (f_1^a+1/2  f_2^1-a  * ) + *F_2
d (f_1^a+1/2  f_2^1-a   * ) & & + d*A_1( f_1^b+3/2  f_2^1-b * d ) 
+ *A_1d(f_1^b+3/2  f_2^1-b  * d).
The
Hodge star products are now with respect to the unwarped
space-time metric and the metric for . The numbers 
depend on the number of legs that  and , respectively, have
in the directions of . To make the last two terms vanish, we
require that  

The first term of expansion  gives the equation of motion for
, and it is
already clear that the metric and couplings will be asymmetric. We can
see this explicitly. Let us assume, for the moment, that the only
way gauge-field kinetic terms arise is from this first term. The
analogue of TNcoupling  now gives a matrix of coupling constants,
 (f_1^a+1/2  f_2^1-a  
*). The value of the coupling now depends on which component of  we
consider through the value of  or . This is a feature
forced on us by the asymmetric
warp factors. For small , we can evaluate warpcoup  for a
harmonic . The harmonic form on our internal space for the
rank  -field is
determined by using the same ansatz as in xiansatz . The function
 is again given
by genericg  but
with different warp factors.  The result in this case (with the
correct normalization) is
g(r) = 2_p^2 (1 + )(1 +
1  )2r (2r+ R'  +
2r   + R' )^2 . 
Using the explicit form for , we see that
S = 1 4g_YM ^2 _a=0 ^2 f^(a) (B)_^7  F^(a)  
F^(a) .
The index  on  again refers to how many legs the field strength has lying along
the -field (e.g. ).  The coupling
 is the usual 
value for  so all of the -dependence is absorbed into the functions 


Explicitly we find, in the limit of small  that:
f^(0)  &=& 1 + B^2 6  - B^4 16  + O (B^6) 

f^(1)  &=& 1 - B^2 6  + 5B^4 48  + O (B^6) 

f^(2)  &=& 1 - B^2 2  + 7B^4 16  + O (B^6). We now demand that our effective space-time action be covariant taking
the form
S 1 G_s _^7  G  G^ G^ F_ 
F_ 
for some coupling  and some metric  which can both
depend on . Note that the indices  in
cov   run over all
 space-time coordinates. If we assume that the -dependence is of the form we
expect from open string physics G_s &=& g_s u(B) 

G_  dx^dx^&=& dx^dx^+ v(B)(dz_1^2 + dz_2^2)
with , then , 
, then we expect the functional dependence of the
action cov  on  to be
S 1 4g_YM ^2  u(B)^-1  [v(B) F_xx F_xx  + 
F_xz F_xz  + v(B)^-1 F_zz F_zz ]. 
We can solve for these parameters in terms of the  above
u(B) &=& (f^(1) (B))^-1  

v(B) &=& f^(0) (B) f^(1) (B)  =
f^(1) (B) f^(2) (B) . 
The second of these equations imposes a consistency check on our
solution. Indeed, if we expand our functions to arbitrary order in 
f^(a) (B) = 1 + _i=1 ^c_i^(a)  B^2i 
then to order ,  the consistency check is simply that 
, which is satisfied by our
solution fa . However, at order , the functions  
of fa  do not satisfy this constraint. This is not surprising for two reasons:
first, higher derivative corrections to supergravity like terms of the
schematic form  can, in principal, 
contribute at . Second, as we shall now see, there are many
additional contributions to the gauge-field kinetic terms even at the
level of supergravity. 

To see this, let us return to our analysis of equation expansion . 
More
interesting, and problematic, than the first term is the second
term. This term is a  form, and so
does not give a non-vanishing term in the action when wedged with 
. However, it does give couplings between the supergravity fields
and the fields localized on the brane in a way described
in . 
For example, a term on the brane of the form

arises this way. 
Usually, without warping, we would
pick a gauge where  is harmonic
d * = 0 to make this term vanish. This still works in the commutative
directions where  if we choose the gauge,
d (* f_1^1/2  f_2  ) =0,
but not for the non-commutative terms with .(There is
  some freedom here to choose a gauge so that the problematic terms
  with  or  vanish rather than . However, the problematic  terms
  cannot be cancelled by a metric fluctuation in the way described
  subsequently. Rather, if these gauge choices are sensible then the 
  term must cancel against a new induced  fluctuation.) 

 How are we to
remedy this problem? Implicitly, we have decoupled metric fluctuations
from our discussion so far, but now we are forced, by the asymmetric warping,
to reintroduce  fluctuations to satisfy the equations of
motion. Said differently, there is a
coupling of the form
cross  (*  G_4) dA_3 where  is a metric fluctuation. The background flux
read from ranktwoM  has the form
 This leads to a
non-vanishing coupling between  and . 


The second term in expansion  is a  form. Let us take the
case of . To cancel these
terms by appropriate metric fluctuations, note that cross 
contributes the following terms to the  equation of motion:
 & d (  g   __1 _6 2   dx^_1  dx^_5  
 g^_6 1  g^22   B_12  *_b  + 
&  g   __1 1 _7   dx^_1  dx^_5  
  g^11  g^_7 2   B_12  * _b ). 
These terms give rise to both  and  forms. The first two 
terms of metricfluct  can cancel the terms of expansion  with
 but not  if
 
The proportionality constant is a function of . The  terms
have the form  for some internal space 2-form
. These terms modify the gauge-field kinetic terms. 

In a similar way, to cancel the terms
with , we also need to consider  and 
fluctuations. To determine the correct combination of metric
fluctuations, we should analyze the equation for metric
fluctuations which comes from terms in the action with the schematic form,
g _L  g + (*  G_4) (* 
G_4) + (*  G_4) dA_3, where  is the operator obtained by expanding  to
quadratic order in the metric fluctuations. 
With a suitable gauge choice,  is the Lichnerowicz
Laplacian. The last two terms arise because of the non-vanishing
background . 

Metric fluctuations are not the only fluctuations induced by our
original choice fluct . The  form  plugged into
the right hand side of eomC  gives a  form. To cancel this
term, we need to supplement the original  with an induced term of the
form
 A_3' *(B_12  F_2)  , where  is a 0-form on the internal space.
This  form is chosen so that the  pieces of 

cancel up to a possible  term on the left hand side. 
In turn, this new induced fluctuation 
mixes, via the Chern-Simons term and the 4-form kinetic term, with
 and . 
Rather than continue along this path, which is quite
involved, let us turn to an
alternate method based on duality. 

 
Insights from duality chasing 

Let us recall the method that we used to generate the warped
supergravity solutions. 
We started with the 11-dimensional Taub-NUT solution.  After reducing
along the circle direction to
get a IIA D6-brane, we T-dualized to get a smeared D5-brane of type IIB.  We then
performed a change of coordinates, and compactified a new
direction. In the static case, we effectively T-dualized back to type
IIA on a non-rectangular torus generating a -field. In the
time-dependent case, we switched to coordinates in which the
null-brane quotient is a simple circle identification. Again, we T-dualized
back to IIA. Generating higher rank -fields simply required more
T-dualities. In either case, the result is a IIA D6-brane with
-fields along some world-volume directions. Finally, we lifted
these configurations to  dimensions. 

At the starting point of this duality chain, the correspondence
between 11-dimensional supergravity and the low-energy theory on the
brane world-volume is well understood.  As discussed in section
, the gauge fluctuations on the
brane correspond to -form fluctuations of the form ,
where  becomes the gauge-field on the brane, and  is the
normalizable harmonic -form on Taub-NUT. The overall normalization of
 is determined by comparing the membrane and open string
actions. On reduction, the correct Yang-Mills
coupling and action emerge.   

To take advantage of our understanding in the basic case, and to learn more
about the warped backgrounds, it is natural to take the
known localized fluctuations from Taub-NUT and push them through the chain of
dualities.  By construction, we should obtain fluctuations of the
-dimensional fields which are localized on the brane, and which
solve the equations of
motion (so that they give rise to massless -dimensional fields).
Let us perform this exercise first for the static case with a rank 
-field, and then for the time-dependent case.

Duality chasing the static background 
We start with the ordinary Taub-NUT gauge fluctuations studied earlier,
A_3 = (A_dx^+ A_5 dx^5 + A_6 dx^6 )where
= 2_p^2 d[H_1^-1  (dy + R 2  
d)].
The warp factor  here, and  appearing below, are defined in section 
.  Note that  has been rescaled to  to agree with
the twisted solution.  This is the same procedure that was followed in section
, but this time we will carry the fluctuations with us under the 
successive dualities.

After chasing this fluctuation through the duality chain, we find that the  fluctuations
appear as -form fluctuations in the new background:
A_3 &=& 2_p^2 A_dx^d[H_1^-1 (dy + 
Rd)] 

&& - 2_p^2 H_1^-1  (_5 F_2). 
In the second line, the  acts only in the , 
directions.  Explicitly in components 
A_  = - 2_p^2 H_1^-1  _ 
 ^  _A_. 
This induced -form fluctuation had to have been there to cancel the
contribution to the equation of motion from the Chern-Simons
coupling. This is precisely the induced  form 
described in indthree . However, here we have an explicit form for
the fluctuation. We can indeed check that chasefluct   satisfies
d   d A_3 =  G_4 A_3. 
The  and  fluctuations give rise to both a -form
fluctuation, 
and metric fluctuations, in a particular combination.  The -form
component is given by
A_3 &=& 2_p^2 (A_5 dz_1 + A_6 dz_2 )[
R 2r^2 H_1^-1  H_2^-1  dr(dy + Rd).


&& . - R 2 H_1^-1  dd]
while the metric fluctuations are most simply written as a pair of vielbein
fluctuations,
e^z_1  &=& H_1^1 3   H_2^-1 3   [dz_1 + 2_p^2 
R 2r^2  H_1^-2  A_6 dr] 

e^z_2  &=& H_1^1 3   H_2^-1 3   [dz_2 - 2_p^2 
R 2r^2  H_1^-2  A_5 dr].
That a combination of metric and -form fluctuations are needed is
in accord with our earlier direct analysis.

Suppose we consider a different set of fluctuations that differ by a gauge
transformation   
Before chasing this fluctuation through the duality chain,
we know that this corresponds to the same supergravity solution because it
differs from our original configuration 
by a 3-form gauge transformation 
  After
performing the dualities, we must therefore also have the same
solution. However, now even the metric
differs for  and .  The resolution must be that the two answers
differ by some combination of 3-form shift and diffeomorphism.  In this
way, what we would have thought of as a  gauge symmetry becomes
mixed with diffeomorphisms, and in this way, the resulting theory can be
reinterpreted as having a non-commutative gauge group.

With some foresight, let us define , .
The latter of these two redefinitions is natural from the change of variables 
() between  and .  The definition of  can then be
justified from the symmetry between  and .  The two equations 
above may now be written
e^z_i  = H_1^1 3   H_2^-1 3   [dz^i + 2_p^2 
 d(H_1^-1  ) ^ij  A_j ].
These results are exact, at least to the extent that supergravity can be 
trusted at each step in the duality chain.  However, in our subsequent
discussion in this section, we will
work only to linear order in the gauge fluctuation .

The form of the metric fluctuation suggests a natural change of coordinates
Z^i = z^i + 2_p^2 H_1^-1  ^ij  A_j
where . 
This diffeomorphism moves all the metric fluctuations into the 
world-volume; in other words, only components of the metric that have no
Taub-NUT indices fluctuate. However, there is no unique choice of
diffeomorphism. There are other diffeomorphisms that
accomplish the same task since only
the -dependence is fixed by this constraint.  

Specifically, let us 
consider a more general change of coordinates
Z^i = z^i + 2_p^2 (H_1^-1  ^ij  - ^ij  
)A_j
where  is a constant anti-symmetric matrix.  The suggestive
label is no mere
coincidence.  As we shall see, this theta will have an interpretation as the 
non-commutativity parameter of the world-volume theory.  Of course, we
could consider more general 
diffeomorphisms, but it turns out that these particular ones are especially nice.
Also, when this diffeomorphism, thetadiffeo , is pulled back to the brane
world-volume, 
i.e. computed at , then the first term drops out leaving simply
Z^i = z^i - 2_p^2 ^ij  A_j.
Under (), the metric fluctuations become
e^z_i  = H_1^1 3   H_2^-1 3   [dZ^i - 2_p^2 (
H_1^-1  ^ij  - ^ij  ) (_A_j dx^+ 
_k A_j dZ^k )]. 
The background -form,
A_3 = H_2^-1  dz_1 dz_2 (dy + Rd)
also changes.  The combination of fluctuating -forms becomes, to 
linear order in  (also neglecting the induced -form from the second line
of chasefluct ),
A_3 &=& 2_p^2 (A_dx^+ 1 ^2   A_i dZ^i 
)d[H_1^-1 (dy + Rd)] 

&& - 2_p^2 H_2^-1 (H_1^-1  - ^12  
)(_A_i dx^+ _j A_i dZ^j )dZ^i 

&& (dy + Rd). 
This expression can be cleaned up by making a -form gauge transformation.
Specifically by adding an exact -form
d[2_p^2 H_2^-1  (H_1^-1  - ^12 
) A_i dZ^i (dy + Rd)], 
we obtain the total fluctuating -form
A_3 &=& 2_p^2 A_dx^d[H_1^-1 (dy + R
d)] 

&& + 2_p^2 A_i dZ^i d[(1 + ^12  )
H_2^-1  (dy + Rd)]. 
As mentioned earlier, we can choose any constant value for the
parameter .  Let us consider three particular choices of 
that simplify the above fluctuations.

The first choice we consider is .  For this choice, the
diffeomorphism () vanishes at .  As we shall see, this 
means effectively that on the brane, we see only commutative gauge 
transformations.  However, we cannot really escape non-commutativity
in the full -dimensional
theory in the sense that a commutative gauge transformation on 
still maps to a diffeomorphism. 

The next choice is , i.e. 
.  In this case, the -form piece above vanishes and the  
fluctuations move entirely into the metric.
The metric fluctuations become explicitly
e^z_i  = H_1^1 3   H_2^-1 3   [dZ^i - 2_p^2
1   H_1^-1  H_2 ^ij  (_A_j dx^+ 
_k A_j dZ^k )].
At  this reduces to
e^z_i  = H_1^1 3   H_2^-1 3   [dZ^i - 2_p^2
1   ^ij  (_A_j dx^+ _k A_j dZ^k
)]. 
One more choice worth mentioning is 
.  If we believe the correspondence between the
 appearing in the diffeomorphism and the  of non-commutative 
Yang-Mills, then this should correspond to pure NCYM.  We find for this
choice that the -form fluctuation becomes
A_3 &=& 2_p^2 A_dx^d[H_1^-1  
(dy + Rd)] 

&& + 2_p^2 A_i dZ^i d[^2 H_2^-1  
(dy + Rd)]. Near , , so  and 
appear on equal footing.  This is precisely what we would expect for pure
NCYM.

Finally, let us consider what happens to the commutative gauge group of our
starting point.  Here, we take the point of view that we have fixed
a diffeomorphism initially. The duality chain and the diffeomorphism
then define  a map from the
original theory of supergravity on a Taub-NUT space to a new theory
with flux.  Under a gauge transformation , 
we are then instructed to perform a further diffeomorphism of the form 
() but with  replaced by  (in addition to
simply shifting  and  by  and ).  This
diffeomorphism acts non-trivially on all of the gauge fields, and on any other
fields that we might consider, such as fields that correspond to scalars
on the D6-brane.  Explicitly, at , a field would transform as
= 2_p^2 ^ij  _j _i . 
So, in total, a gauge field like  would transform as
A_= _+ 2_p^2 ^ij  _j _i
A_. 
These are, of course, the expected noncommutative gauge transformations
to linear order in .

Relation to the Seiberg-Witten map 
In this section we will set .
The diffeomorphism () for the case  has an
interesting relation to the Seiberg-Witten map relating the
non-commutative gauge field  to the ordinary gauge
field . As shown in
, in the presence of
a background -field, we can define (for ) the following
diffeomorphism on the world-volume of a single D-brane:
X^i = x^i + ^ij A _j(x).
Under this diffeomorphism,
(F_ij (X) + B_ij )X^i x^k X^j x^l  = B_kl 
so that the coordinates  are interpreted as the coordinates in which
the commutative field strength  is constant.
This diffeomorphism therefore moves the gauge
fluctuations on the brane entirely into the metric.
Moreover, the
diffeomorphism () is not unique, but only defined up to
diffeomorphisms that leave  invariant.

We have already seen that under the diffeomorphism () for
, the gauge field fluctuations are moved entirely into the
metric, at least to linear order in . Based on its remarkable similarity to
(), it is natural to wonder whether we can move 
the gauge fluctuations into the metric to all orders in .
We will argue below that this is indeed the case provided
we replace  in () by . Specifically, we will
use the diffeomorphism
Z^i = z^i + (H_1^-1  ^ij  - (B^-1 )^ij  
)A _j(Z)
= z^i +
1   H_1^-1  H_2 ^ij  A _j(Z).
To facilitate comparison with (), 
it is convenient to rewrite () as 
z^i = Z^i - 1   H_1^-1  H_2 ^ij  A _j(Z).
The coordinate  is thus the analogue of  in (),
while  is the analogue of .
Instead of applying this diffeomorphism to the fields
 and  respectively, it is more
useful to apply it to the field strengths
 and .
Using the explicit forms of the background field () and
the fluctuation () obtained by the duality chasing, we compute
G_4 &=&  dz^1dz^2 d[H_2^-1  (dy + 
R 2   d)], 

G_4 &=&  (F_12  dz^1dz^2 + _A_i dx^dz^i 
) 

&& [R 2r^2 H_1^-1 H_2^-1  dr(dy +R 2  
 d) - R 2 H_1^-1   dd]


&&+ ^2R^2 4r^2  H_1^-2  H_2^-1  A_idz^idr
ddwhere we have only shown the terms in  that are independent of
.
We now apply the diffeomorphism () to 
. 
In order to compare the result with (), which strictly
speaking, is valid for maximal rank -field, we will now ignore all
dependence of the gauge fields on the coordinates  which
correspond to worldvolume coordinates transverse to the -field.
Having thus dropped all terms involving , we find
to lowest order,  and
G_4+G_4dZ^1dZ^2 d[H_2^-1  (dy + 
R 2   d)].
Thus, to lowest order,  we can indeed interpret the  as the
coordinates in which the 4-form
field strength  is constant (in ), and () is the
natural generalization of (). 

We shall now verify the second order correction, so we
write .  The second order piece, , is a
function of the space-time coordinates, and of , and is explicitly
given by:
A_i = A_i + a_i =
A_i + ^jk  (2A_k _j A_i - A_k _i A_j )
+ O (A^3)
where we have defined the natural -dependent combination
^ij  = - 1   H_1^-1  H_2 ^ij .
Note that this is precisely the tensor contracted with  
in ().
To this order, we now find
G_4+G_4dZ^1dZ^2 d[H_2^-1  (dy + 
R 2   d)] + P_i dZ^i dr
dd,
where,
P_1 &=& -R 2^2  
[R^2  2r^2   H_1^-2  H_2^-1 
a_1 + H_1^-1  _r a_1 

& & - R 2r^2 ^2   H_1^-3  (
2A_1 _2 A_1 - A_2 _1 A_1 - A_1 _1 A_2 )+ O (A^3)],
and similarly for . In writing the above expression, we have used
A_1(z) = A_1(Z) - 1   H_1^-1  H_2 (A_2 _1 A_1 - 
A_1 _2 A_1 ) + O (A^3).
We see from () that we can interpret the  as the
coordinates in which the 4-form
field strength  is constant (in ) only if the  vanish.
Due to the presence of the derivatives in , the constraint 
provides a non-trivial
consistency check of the diffeomorphism ()
with the choice of -dependent noncommutativity
parameter (). 
Happily, the choice of  given
by () indeed satisfies this constraint.

At ,  reduces to the previous ,
and () reproduces
the Seiberg-Witten map between  and  to linear
order in . In this sense
we can view equation () as a lift of the usual
Seiberg-Witten map  between
commutative and non-commutative variables to the full supergravity theory.
The diffeomorphism () is the corresponding lift 
of equation ().
It is very reasonable to expect that the above procedure can be iterated,
and that this lift can be constructed to all finite orders in  (or
equivalently to all finite orders in ).  We expect that all of
the statements of the previous section should similarly extend to
all orders.

Duality chasing the time-dependent background 

Before jumping into a time-dependent duality chase, it is worth surveying the
structure of the time-dependent solution 11Dtimedep , which takes the form:
ds^2 &=& f_1(r, x^+) (-2dx^+ dx^- + dx_3^2 + dx_4^2
+ dx_5^2 ) + f_2(r,x^+) (dx^2 + dz^2 )


&&  + f_3(r,x^+) (-x^2 (dx^+)^2 +
2x^+ xdx^+ dx)+ f_4(r,x^+) ds__1 ^2 + f_5(r,x^+) ds__2 ^2. The accompanying M theory  has both  and 
pieces. There are multiple warp factors in the metric survey  but
what is most remarkable is that the internal space warp factors depend
on . In this sense, space-time and the internal space are warped
with respect to one another. A direct analysis of small fluctuations, along
the lines of section , should demonstrate the
existence of a localized gauge-field in an interesting way. 
However, the same issues that we met in the static case
will also appear in this case. We will therefore follow the duality
chasing tactic again. 

Let us start again with the fluctuation , where 
= 2_p^2 d[H^-1  (dy + R  d)]. 
On T-dualizing , changing to invariant null-brane coordinates, T-dualizing
back, and lifting to  dimensions, we find again a mixing of -form
and metric fluctuations.  Let us first define the following combinations
of the original gauge fluctuations which naturally appear at the end of the
duality chain:
A_+ &=& A_+ + z A_x + z^2 A_- 

A_x &=& A_x + z A_-.
We drop the tildes from now on.  Furthermore, we make the same definitions as 
before so that the coordinates agree with ().  Then the result 
is a -form fluctuation
A_3 &=& 2_p^2 [A_i dx^i + A_- dx^- + Hh^-1  A_z dz
+ (A_+ + h^-1 (x^+ x R^2  A_x + x^2 R^2  A_- )
)dx^+ .

&& . + (Hh^-1  A_x - h^-1  x^+ x R^2  A_- ) dx
][c r^2  H^-2  dr(dy + cd)

&& - cH^-1  (A_+ dx^+ + A_- dx^- + A_x dx + A_z dz + A_i
dx^i )dd. The metric fluctuations can be most succinctly written by making some 
replacements in the metric ()
& dx^- &dx^- + 2_p^2 c r^2  H^-2  x R  A_z dr 

& dx &dx + 2_p^2 c r^2  H^-2  x^+ R  A_z dr 

& dz &dz - 2_p^2 c r^2  H^-2  (x^+ R  A_x
+ x R  A_- ) dr. As before, a particular change of coordinates presents itself for use
in moving the metric fluctuations purely into the world-volume 
directions.  If we let  run over the indices (, , ), then a
natural diffeomorphism is
X^= x^- 2_p^2 H^-1  ^  A_where, 
^z-  &=& -^-z  = x R  

^zx  &=& -^xz  = x^+ R , with all other components of  zero.  This agrees with the results
reported in .

We close by noting that under this diffeomorphism, the fluctuating
part of the -form becomes (to
linear order in )
A_3 &=& 2_p^2 (A_+ dx^+ + A_i dx^i + A_dx^)d[H^-1  (dy + cd)] 

&& - 2_p^2 H^-1  h^-1  [(x^+ R )^2 d(
A_z dz) + (x R^2  A_- + x^+ R^2  A_x ) dx^+ dx .

&& . + (x R  dx^+ - x^+ R  dx)(
x^+ R  dA_x + x R  dA_- )](dy + c
d).  Clearly, there is much more to be said. This analysis can be continued
along the lines of
section  and section , perhaps giving an
analogue from gravity of the Seiberg-Witten map for the time-dependent case.

Conventions and Rules 
In performing type II T-duality and lifts to M theory, we will
(mostly) use the conventions
found in. Let  denote the
eleven-dimensional Planck scale, and  denote the string scale. 

Lifting IIA to M theory 

A type IIA SUGRA configuration can be lifted to 11 dimensions.  Let
 parametrize the eleventh direction. The 
coordinate is compact with periodicity .  Writing the 11-dimensional
fields on the left and the IIA fields on the right, we have:

G_  &=& e^-2 3  G_ ^(IIA)  + 
e^4 3  C_C_

G_y  &=& -_p e^4 3  C_

G_yy  &=& _p^2 e^4 3   

A_  &=& C_  

A_y  &=& _p B_ . T-Duality 

We dualize in the direction , which we scale to have periodicity 
(and is hence dimensionless).

The NS-NS fields transform in the following manner:
e^2&=& _s^2 e^2  G_xx   

G_xx ' &=& _s^4 G_xx   

G_x ' &=& _s^2 B_x  G_xx   

G_ ' &=& G_  - G_x G_x  - B_x B_x  G_xx  


B_x ' &=& _s^2 G_x  G_xx   

B_ ' &=& B_  - B_x G_x  - G_x B_x  G_xx  .
The transformation of the R-R potentials is given by
_s^-1 C_x ^(n)  ' &=& C_ ^(n-1)  -
(n-1)C_[x ^(n-1) G_]x  G_xx   

_s C_ ^(n)  ' &=&
C_x ^(n+1)  + nC_[ ^(n-1) B_]x 
+ n(n-1)C_[x ^(n-1) B_x G_]x  G_xx  .
