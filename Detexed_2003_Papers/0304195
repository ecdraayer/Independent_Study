Abstract 

 
We propose a useful method for deriving the effective theory 
for a system where BPS and anti-BPS domain walls coexist. 
Our method respects an approximately preserved SUSY near each wall. 
Due to the finite width of the walls, SUSY breaking terms arise at tree-level, 
which are exponentially suppressed. 
A practical approximation using the BPS wall solutions is also discussed. 
We show that a tachyonic mode appears in the matter sector 
if the corresponding mode function has a broader profile 
than the wall width. 

  



Introduction 
Supersymmetry  (SUSY) is one of the most promising candidate 
for the solution to the hierarchy problem. 
When you construct a realistic model, however, SUSY must be broken 
because no superparticles have been observed yet. 
Thus, considering some SUSY breaking mechanism is an important issue 
for the realistic model-building. 
However, conventional SUSY breaking mechanisms are somewhat complicated 
in four dimensions. 

On the other hand, the brane-world scenario , which was originally 
proposed as an alternative solution to the hierarchy problem, 
has been attracted much attention and investigated in various frameworks. 
It is based on an idea that our four-dimensional (4D) world is embedded 
into a higher dimensional space-time(The original idea along 
this direction was proposed in Ref.. 
) . 
The 4D hypersurface on which we live is generally called a brane , 
and it can be a D brane (a stack of D branes) in the string theory 
or a topological defect in the field theory like a domain wall, 
vortex, monopole and so on. 
Recently, in spite of its original motivation of solving 
the hierarchy problem, the extra dimensions are utilized 
in order to explain various phenomenological problems, 
such as the fermion mass hierarchy, 
the proton stability, 
the doublet-triplet splitting in the grand unified theory 
and so on. 
In particular, the brane-world scenario can provide some simple mechanisms 
of SUSY breaking. 
One of them is a mechanism where SUSY is broken by the boundary conditions 
for the bulk fields.(
Its basic idea was first proposed in Ref.. ) 

There is another interesting SUSY breaking mechanism, 
which utilizes BPS objects . 
They are the states that saturate the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) 
bound, and preserve part of the bulk SUSY. 




By using the (BPS) D branes, for example, we can break 
SUSY in a very simple way. 
This mechanism is called pseudo-supersymmetry   or 
quasi-supersymmetry  . 
In this mechanism, the theory has two or more sectors 
in which different fractions of the bulk SUSY are preserved, 
and all of it are broken in the whole system. 
One of the simplest examples is a system where parallel D3 brane and 
anti-D3 brane coexist with a finite distance. 
(See Fig..) 
Since each brane preserves an opposite half of the bulk SUSY, 
SUSY is completely broken in this system. 
A 4D effective theory for such a system can be derived by using 
the technique of the nonlinear realization for the space-time 
symmetries . 



   our-setup.eps  
 The brane configuration of the pseudo-supersymmetry. 
 

In the field theoretical context, 
there is a similar SUSY breaking mechanism to the pseudo-supersymmetry. 
In this mechanism, SUSY is broken due to the coexistence of 
two BPS domain walls  which preserve 
opposite halves of the bulk SUSY. 
Therefore, the corresponding field configuration is non-BPS. 
We will refer to such a non-BPS configuration 
as a wall-antiwall configuration  in this paper. 
One of the main differences from the pseudo-supersymmetry is 
that the BPS walls have a finite width unlike the D-branes. 
Due to this wall width, SUSY breaking terms arise at tree-level 
in contrast to the pseudo-supersymmetry scenario 
where they are induced by quantum effects. 
In general, such a non-BPS configuration is unstable. 
However, we can construct a stable wall-antiwall configuration 
by introducing a topological winding around the target space 
of the scalar fields. 

When you discuss the phenomenological arguments on the wall-antiwall 
background, we need to derive a low-energy effective theory on it. 
If we eliminate the auxiliary fields of the superfields at the first step, 
the procedure of integrating out the massive modes becomes very complicated 
. 
In the case of the BPS-wall background, this complication can be avoided 
by keeping a half of the bulk SUSY preserved by the wall to be manifest, 
i.e.  by expanding the bulk superfields directly 
into lower-dimensional superfields 
for the unbroken SUSY.  
In the case of the wall-antiwall background, however, such a way out 
cannot be applied because there is no SUSY preserved in the whole system. 
Therefore, it is difficult to derive the effective theory 
on such a background correctly. 
In Ref., only mass-splitting between boson and fermion in 
each supermultiplet is calculated 
with the help of the low-energy theorem .(
Some other SUSY breaking terms were also estimated in Ref., 
but they were only part of the whole terms.) 


In this paper, we will propose a useful method for 
deriving the effective theory in the wall-antiwall system. 
To avoid inessential complications, we will consider three-dimensional 
(3D) walls in a 4D bulk theory throughout this paper. 
Our method respects the approximately supersymmetric structure 
near the walls, and the resultant Lagrangian is written by 
the 3D superfields and the SUSY breaking terms. 
We can calculate all SUSY breaking parameters  systematically 
in our method. 



Using this method, we will show that a tachyonic mode appears 
in the effective theory from the matter sector 
if the corresponding mode function has a broader profile 
than the wall width. 
We will also provide an approximation method using the BPS wall solutions. 
This approximation is useful as a practical method
because the BPS wall solutions can easily be found than the non-BPS ones. 

In the superstring theory, it is well-known that 
BPS D-branes can be described by the kink solutions 
in the field theory of the tachyon. 
In particular, a D brane and anti-D brane pair is described 
as a wall-antiwall solution 
in an effective theory on a non-BPS D brane. 
Thus, our method can also be used 
in the discussion of the tachyon condensation 
in the superstring theory. 

This paper is organized as follows. 
In the next section, we will provide useful expressions 
of the 4D bulk action, which respect opposite halves of the bulk SUSY. 
In Sect., we will consider the wall-antiwall configuration 
and derive the 3D effective theory. 


A practical approximation method is provided in Sect..  
In Sect., we will demonstrate our method 
in an explicit example of the stable wall-antiwall configuration.  
We will also discuss the gauge interactions in Sect.. 
Sect. is devoted to the summary and the discussion. 
Notations and some useful properties of the classical background 
are listed in the appendices. 







Useful expressions of the bulk action  We will consider the following Wess-Zumino model as a 4D  bulk theory. 
 S=^4 xd ^2d ^2   +^4 xd ^2 W()+^4 xd ^2 W ( ), 
 where 
 (y^,)=A(y^)+2 (y^)+^2F(y^) 
 (y^x^+i^) 
is a chiral superfield. 

Here, we decompose the Grassmann coordinates  and  
as(
The notations of  and  are different from those 
in Refs..)  
 ^= e^i/2  2  (_2^+i_1^), 
 ^   = e^-i/2  2  (_2^
 where  is a constant phase. 
Corresponding to this decomposition, we also decompose the 
supercharges  and  as 
 Q_= e^-i/2  2  (Q_2 -iQ_1 ), 
 Q _   = -(Q_)^* = -e^i/2  2  
 (Q_2 +iQ_1 ).  Then, it follows that 
 Q+Q =_1Q_1+_2Q_2. 
Under the above decomposition, the 4D  SUSY algebra can be rewritten as 
 Q_1 ,Q_1  Q_2 ,Q_2  
 =2_(3) ^m^2 _ P_m, 

 Q_1 ,Q_2  -Q_2 ,Q_1  
 =-2i^2 _ P_2. 
This can be interpreted as the central extended 3D  SUSY algebra 
if we identify  with the central charge. 

Now, if we perform an integration for  in Eq.(), 
we can obtain the following expression. 
 S=^3xd ^2_1d x_2  
 D_1^ ^(1) D_1 ^(1) 
 +2 ^(1) _2^(1) +4e^-i W(^(1) )  , 
 where , 
 
is a covariant spinor derivative(
Throughout this paper, derivatives for Grassmann variables are regarded as 
left-derivatives.)  for -SUSY, and 
 ^(1) (x^m,x_2,_1)e^_1Q_1 A(x^m,x_2) 

 A+e^i/2 (^2)_ _1^^ +i 2 _1^2(_2 A+e^i F).  Throughout this paper,  denotes the 3D Lorentz index, 
and the -direction is chosen as the extra dimension. 
The relation between  and the original chiral superfield  
is given by 
 (y^,)=
 e^-_1_2_2 e^-i_2D_1+i_2^2_2 ^(1) 
 (x^m,x_2,_1).  On the other hand, if we perform an integration for , Eq.() 
becomes 
 S=^3xd ^2_2d x_2 
 D_2^ ^(2) D_2 ^(2) 
 +2 ^(2) _2^(2) -4e^-i W(^(2) )  , 
 where  
is a covariant spinor derivative for -SUSY, and 
 ^(2) (x^m,x_2,_2)e^_2Q_2 A(x^m,x_2) 

 A-ie^i/2 (^2)_ _2^^ +i 2 _2^2(_2 A-e^i F). 
The relation between  and  is given by 
 (y^,)=
 e^_1_2_2 e^i_1D_2+i_1^2_2 ^(2) 
 (x^m,x_2,_2).  From Eqs.() and (), we can obtain the relation 
between  and  as follows. 
 ^(1) (x^m,x_2,_1) __2=0  = e^i_1D_2+i_1_2 
 ^(2) __2=0  

 ^(2) (x^m,x_2+i_1^2,i_1)  In fact, we can explicitly show that 
 && ^2_1d x_2  
 D_1^ ^(2) (x^m,x_2-i_1^2,-i_1) 
 D_1 ^(2) (x^m,x_2+i_1^2,i_1)  . 

 &&  .+2 ^(2) 
 (x^m,x_2-i_1^2,-i_1)_2
 ^(2) (x^m,x_2+i_1^2,i_1)   

 ^2_2d x_2 
 D_2^ ^(2) D_2 ^(2) 
 +2 ^(2) _2^(2)   , 
 and 
 ^2_1d x_2 
 e^-i W(^(2) (x^m,x_2+i_1^2,i_1))  
 = ^2_2d x_2 
 -e^-i W(^(2) ) . 
 Namely, we can derive Eq.() by substituting Eq.() 
into Eq.(). 


Wall-antiwall system  Classical field configuration 
Let us assume that the bulk theory () has two supersymmetric 
vacua  and , and that there exists a BPS domain wall 
configuration  which interpolates between them. 
That is, 
 (-)=,  ()=,
and  satisfies a BPS equation 
 _2 i W '(A _cl1 ),  where a prime denotes a differentiation for the argument, and 
 W()-W() . 
If we take this value of  as that in the decompositions () 
and (),  and  correspond to the unbroken and 
broken supercharges respectively. 

When the theory has the BPS domain wall , 
it also has the "anti-BPS" domain wall . That is, 
 (-)=,  ()=, 
and the BPS equation for  is 

 _2 i W '(A _cl2 ).  This anti-BPS wall preserves -SUSY and breaks -SUSY. 

Now we will consider a system in which the above two kinds of BPS walls 
coexist. 
Since the two walls preserve opposite halves of the bulk SUSY, 
All of it are broken in such a system. 
That is, a corresponding field configuration  is non-BPS. 
Unlike the BPS wall, such a non-BPS configuration is usually unstable 
. 
However, we can construct a stable non-BPS configuration 
by introducing the topological winding around the target space of 
the scalar field . 
We will discuss an explicit example of such a stable configuration 
in Sect.. 
In the following, we will assume that the extra dimension (-direction) 
is compactified on  with radius . 

Furthermore, to simplify the discussions, we will also assume that 
the superpotential  has the following symmetric property(
This assumption is not essential for our method of deriving 
the effective theory. 
It is just a matter of convenience. 
) . 
 W'(A-A_M )=W'(A_M -A),  where  is a middle point between 
the two vacua on the target space. 
Under this assumption, the BPS and anti-BPS walls are located 
at antipodal points on , and  has the following property. 
(See Fig. in Sect..)
 _2(x_2-R) _2(x_2), 

 W'((x_2-R)) W'((x_2)).  The upper signs in R.H.S correspond to 
the case of a stable configuration with the topological winding, 
and the lower signs correspond to the case of an unstable configuration 
with no winding. 
From now on, we will choose the origin of the coordinate  
so that the (approximate) BPS wall is 
located at  and the anti-BPS wall is at . 


Mode-expansion 
First, we will consider the mode-expansion of  in Eq.(). 
The classical background of  is 
 ^(1) (x_2,_1) e^_1Q_1 (x_2)
 =(x_2)+i 2 _1^2_2(x_2)+e^i F_cl (x_2)  
 

 (x_2)+i 2 _1^2_2(x_2)-e^i 
 W '(A _cl (x_2)) . 
Here we used the equation of motion for the auxiliary field  
in the last equation. 

Similarly, the background of  is 
 ^(2) (x_2,_2) = e^_2Q_2 (x_2) 
 =(x_2)+i 2 _2^2_2(x_2)+e^i 
 W '(A _cl (x_2)) . 
The superfield equation of motion 
 -1 4 D ^2 +W'()=0 
can be rewritten in terms of  as -1 2 D_1^2 ^(1) +i_2 ^(1) 
 -ie^-i W'(^(1) )=0. 
 By substituting  into 
Eq.() and using the equation of motion for , 
we can obtain the linearized equation of motion 
for the fluctuation field  as 
 -1 2 D_1^2  ^(1) +i_2  ^(1) 
 -ie^-i W"(^(1) ) ^(1) 
 =0.  Let us denote the component fields of  as 
  ^(1) =a^(1) +_1^(1) +1 2 _1^2f^(1) . 
Then, we can obtain the following linearized equation of motion 
for  by picking up linear terms for  from 
Eq.(). 
 -i_(3) ^m_m ^(1)  _ +i_2 ^(1) _-i W"()^(1) _ 
 =0. 
Therefore, the mode equation for  can be read off as 
 i_2u ^(1) _(n) -e^-i W"()u^(1) _(n)  
 =m_(n) u ^(1) _(n) ,  where  are eigenvalues. 
Note that this has a very similar form to that of the BPS-wall case 
. 
The only difference is that the argument of  is 
a non-BPS configuration , instead of . 
On the other hand, the mode equation for  receives more corrections 
than that for  when you change the background 
from the BPS one to the non-BPS one. 


Therefore, it is convenient to use the mode functions of 
 in the following derivation of the 3D effective theory. 

To simplify the discussion, we will consider a case that 
 and all parameters of the 4D bulk theory are real. 
In this case,  (
There is another possibility that , but it can be reduced 
to the case of  by the redefinition of the coordinate: 
. 
)  and the mode equation () can be 
rewritten as  
 -_2+W"() n  m_(n) n , 

 _2+W"() n  m_(n) n ,  where  and  are defined by 
 u^(1) _(n) =1 2  (n +in ). 
Using these mode functions,  can be expanded into 
3D fields as 
 ^(1) _(x^m,x_2)=1 2  _n=0 ^ n (x_2)_R (n) (x^m)
 +in (x_2)_I (n) (x^m) . 
 Here, note that the mode equation () has two zero-modes, 
 0 (x_2) C_0e^_0^x_2 d yW"((y)) , 
 

 0 (x_2) C_0e^-_R ^x_2 d yW"((y)) , 
 where  is a common normalization factor. 
The corresponding fields  and  are the goldstinos
for the broken - and -SUSY, and localized on the (approximate) 
BPS and anti-BPS walls, respectively. 
Therefore, it is convenient to introduce the following 3D superfields. 
 ^(1) _(0) (x^m,_1) a^(1) _(0) (x^m)+_10 (x^m)
 +1 2 _1^2f^(1) _(0) (x^m), 

 ^(2) _(0) (x^m,_2) a^(2) _(0) (x^m)+_20 (x^m)
 +1 2 _2^2f^(2) _(0) (x^m).  Considering Eqs.() and (), 
the mode-expansion of the fluctuation field  
can be expressed as 
  ^(1) (x^m,x_2,_1) 1 2  
 0 (x_2)^(1) _(0) (x^m,_1)+0 (x_2+i_1^2)
 ^(2) _(0) (x^m,i_1)  

 &&+(massive modes ).   Strictly speaking, the bosonic component of this expression deviates 
the correct mode-expansion 
because we used the mode functions of . 
However, this deviation is negligibly small when the distance 
between the walls is large enough(
In the BPS wall limit, the mode functions of bosonic and fermionic 
zero-modes approach to a common function.)  
On the other hand, the massive modes cannot be well described 
by using 3D superfields 
because they have broadly spread profiles along the -direction 
and thus receive large SUSY breaking effects. 


Derivation of 3D effective theory 
In the following, we will concentrate ourselves on the low-energy region 
where all massive modes are decoupled, and will drop them from expressions. 
By substituting the expression 
 ^(1) (x^m,x_2,_1) ^(1) (x_2,_1) 

 &&+1 2  0 (x_2)^(1) _(0) (x^m,_1)
 +0 (x_2+i_1^2)^(2) _(0) (x^m,i_1)  
into Eq.() and carrying out the -integration, 
we can obtain the 3D effective theory. 

A zero-th order term for the fields, i.e.  the cosmological 
constant term, can be calculated as 
 _cc ^(3)  ^2_1d x_2 
 D_1^ _cl ^(1) D_1 ^(1)  
 +2 _cl ^(1) _2^(1) 
 +4W(^(1) )   

 -x_2 (_2)^2+W'() ^2  =-V_0,
 where  is an energy (per unit area) of the background 
field configuration . 

Linear terms for the fields are cancelled due to 
the equation of motion for . 

Then, we will calculate quadratic terms for the fields. 
 _quad ^(3)  ^2_1d x_2

 -1 2 m_0^2a^(1) _(0) -a^(2) _(0)  ^2, 
 where  is 
a dimensionless number, which is exponentially suppressed 
in terms of the wall distance , 
and the scalar mass parameter  is defined as 
 m_0^2 -x_2 W"'()0 ^2 
 =x_2  W"'()0 ^2 

 x_2 W"'()0 0  
 =-x_2 W"'()0 0 , Here, we have used the formulae Eqs.() and 
(), 
and the functions  and  are defined as 

 (x_2) _2(x_2)+W'((x_2)), 

 (x_2) _2(x_2)-W'((x_2)),  which are contained in  and  as 
 ^(1) (x_2,_1)(x_2)+i 2 _1^2(x_2), 
 

 ^(2) (x_2,_2)(x_2)+i 2 _2^2(x_2). 
 Note that  and  satisfy the mode equations () 
with , and are related to  and  as 
 (x_2)=V_0 0 (x_2), 
 (x_2)=V_0 0 (x_2). Equalities in Eq.() are followed from 
this relation and Eqs. () and () 
in Appendix . 

From Eqs.() and (), 
the bosonic part of the 3D Lagrangian  is 
 ^(3) _bosonic  -V_0-1 2 
 (^ma^(1) _(0) ,^ma^(2) _(0) )1   1

 &&+(interaction terms ). 
 Then, canonically normalized scalar fields are 
 a_+(0) 1+ 2  a^(1) _(0) +a^(2) _(0)  , 
 

 a_-(0) 1- 2  a^(1) _(0) -a^(2) _(0)  . 
 For the auxiliary fields, we redefine them as 
 f_+(0) 1- 2  f^(1) _(0) +f^(2) _(0)  , 


 f_-(0) 1+ 2  f^(1) _(0) -f^(2) _(0)  . 
Using these fields, Eq.() can be rewritten as 
 ^(3) _bosonic  -V_0-1 2 ^ma_+(0) _ma_+(0) 
 -1 2 ^ma_-(0) _ma_-(0) 
 -1 2 2m_0^2 1-  a_-(0) ^2 

 &&+1 2 f_+(0) ^2+1 2 f_-(0) ^2+(interaction terms ). 
 Notice that the massless mode  is the Nambu-Goldstone mode 
for the translation along the -direction. 
In fact, the mode function of  is 
 u_+(0) (x_2) 1 2(1-)  0 (x_2)+0 (x_2) 
 

 &&1 2(1-)V_0  (x_2)+(x_2) 
 =2 (1-)V_0  _2(x_2). 
This mode function is correctly normalized as expected. 
 x_2 u_+(0) ^2 =1. 
We can calculate interaction terms in a similar way. 
For example, cubic couplings are obtained as 

 ^(3) _cubic  ^2_1d x_2
 41 3! W"'(^(1) ) ^3  

 _111 a^(1) _(0)  ^3+_112 a^(1) _(0)  ^2a^(2) _(0)

 &&+g_(-RI )  2  a^(1) _(0) -a^(2) _(0)  0 0 , 
 where 
 _111  1 62  x_2 W"'()0 ^3, 
 

 _112  1 2  x_2 
 W"'()0 ^2_20 +1 2 W""()0 ^20  , 
 

 _122  1 2  x_2
 W"'()0 ^2_20 +1 2 W""()0 ^20  , 
 

 _222  1 62  x_2 W"'()0 ^3, 
  

 g_(-RI )  -x_2 W"'()0 ^20 
 =x_2 W"'()0 ^20 .  The second equality in Eq.() is followed from 
the relations (), () and (). 

The "-terms" for  and  correspond to Eq.(3.3) 
in Ref., but terms for  and  
were missed there. 

Notice that the above cubic couplings are all SUSY breaking terms. 
In fact, we can easily show that there are no supersymmetric couplings 
in the effective theory. 
This stems from the assumption that  and all parameters 
in the bulk theory are real. 
As will be seen in the next section, supersymmetric interaction terms 
appear in the effective theory if we introduce a complex coupling constant 
in the bulk theory. 

The existence of the last Yukawa coupling term in Eq.() 
is expected from the low-energy theorem, which predicts 
the relation among the Yukawa coupling constant ,  
the mass-splitting between the bosonic and fermionic modes  
and an order parameter of SUSY breaking  as 
 g_(-RI ) =m_0^2 V_0  . 
This relation can easily be seen from Eqs.(), () 
and () in our approach.  


Matter fields  In order to construct a more realistic model, we need to introduce 
matter fields, which do not contribute to the domain wall configuration. 
Here, we will introduce an extra chiral superfield  as matter fields 
whose interactions are given by 
 W_int (,X)= 2 W"()X^2+X^3, 
 where constants  and  are positive and complex, respectively. 
The first term in Eq.() is required in order to localize 
the lowest modes of  on the walls, and the second term provides 
interactions among the matter fields, which are important 
when we discuss the phenomenology(
Proliferation of the matter fields is straightforward. 
) . 
The component fields of  are denoted as 
 X(y,)=A_X(y)+2 _X(y)+^2F_X(y). 
We will assume that  does not have a nontrivial background, 
i.e.  .
The corresponding field to  in Eq.() is 
 ^(1) _X(x^m,x_2,_1) e^_1Q_1 
 A_X(x^m,x_2)  

 a^(1) _X(x^m,x_2)+_1^(1) _X(x^m,x_2)
 +1 2 _1^2f^(1) _X(x^m,x_2).
The mode equations for the fermionic component  
can be obtained in the same way as the derivation of Eq.().  
 -_2+W"() n  m_X(n) n , 

 _2+W"() n  m_X(n) n , 
 where  are eigenvalues. 
Using solutions of these equations,  can be expanded as 
 ^(1) _X (x^m,x_2)=1 2  _n=0 ^
 n (x_2)_R (n) (x^m)
 +in (x_2)_I (n) (x^m) . 
From Eq.(), we can see that there exist two zero-modes 
whose mode functions are  
 0 (x_2) C_Xe^_0^x_2 d y
 W"((y)) ,  

 0 (x_2) C_Xe^-_R ^x_2 d y
 W"((y)) ,  where  is a common normalization factor. 

Following Eqs.() and (), 
we can see that  can be expanded approximately as
 ^(1) _X 1 2  
 0 (x_2)^(1) _X(0) (x^m,_1)

carrying out the -integration.

whose mass eigenvalues are

For different values of , the mass spectrum of the scalar modes 
has different features. 
First, let us consider the case of .(

For example, see the comment below Eq.().) 
In this case,  has a sharp peak around  
and can be well approximated there by the following Gaussian function. 
 0 (x_2) C_Xe^-b 2 x_2^2 , 
 (in the neighborhood of . )
where .(
From the assumption that , we can show that . ) 
This means that the normalization factor  is estimated as 
 C_X b   ^1/4 . 
Therefore, we can approximate  as 
 0 (x_2) b   ^1/4  
 (x_2) (0)  ^. 
As a result, we can clarify an -dependence of

 m_X^2 ^3 b

in Appendix . 
From this expression, we can see that the absolute value of

On the other hand,  increases linearly as  grows up(
We can show that R.H.S. in Eq.() is positive 
from the assumption that . 
) .

 (when  ) because  can be approximated by  
when  is large enough. 

From Eqs.() and (), 
we can conclude that the two lightest modes  
become almost degenerate with a large mass eigenvalue 
compared to  in Eq.() 
in the case of . 

In the case of , the mode equation () has 
the same form as Eq.(). 
As a result,  and a massless scalar besides 
the NG mode  appears in the 3D effective theory. 

As we will see in Sect., in the case of , 
it follows that  and thus 
there appears a tachyonic mode in the effective theory. 
This means that the classical background  is 
unstable. 

In the case of , both  and  become zero, 
and thus both scalar modes  are massless. 
This is a trivial result because 
SUSY breaking in the -sector is not transmitted 
to the -sector at tree-level in this case. 



Next, we will consider interaction terms. 
They are calculated just in a similar way to the derivation 
of Eq.(). 
The interaction terms among the matter fields, which come from 
the second term of Eq.(), are as follows. 
 ^(3)m  _cubic  ^2_1

 _112 ^X  2  x_2 
 0 ^2_20 ,  
 _122 ^X  2  x_2
 _20 0 ^2. 
The first line of R.H.S. in Eq.() represents 
supersymmetric interactions, which were absent in Eq.(), 
and the remaining terms are 
SUSY breaking terms.  

The interaction terms between the "wall fields" and the matter fields, 
which come from the first term of Eq.(), can also 
be calculated in a similar way. 


BPS-wall approximation  In this section, we will provide a useful approximation 
for the derivation of the 3D effective theory(
A method we will provide in this section is essentially the same one 
as the "single-wall approximation" proposed in Ref.,  
but it was used only to estimate the mass-splittings 
between bosons and fermions. 
Here, we will show that it can be applied to the estimation 
of all parameters  in the effective theory.   
) . 
Since the BPS equations () and () are 
first order differential equations, 
finding the BPS wall solutions  and  is 
easier than finding the non-BPS configuration , 
which is a solution of a second order differential equation. 
So it is a practical method 
to approximate  by using  and . 

For example, let us derive an approximate expression of  
defined in Eq.(). 

Notice that  is well approximated as follows(
Locations of the walls are taken to be at  in the definition 
of  and . 
) . 
 (x_2) . 
Then, using the BPS equation (), 
 (x_2)2_2(x_2-R), in the region of . 

On the other hand, from Eqs.() and (), 
 can be written as 
 (x_2)=(R)e^-_R ^x_2 d y W"((y)) . 
 From Eq.(), the constant factor  is estimated as 
 (R)2_2(0). Thus, in the region of , Eq.() is 
approximated as 
 (x_2)(R)e^-_0^x_2 d y W"((y))
 +_0^R/2 d y W"((y))+_R/2 ^R d y 
 W"((y))  

 (R)e^2_0^R/2 d y W"((y)) 
 e^-_0^x_2 d y W"((y))  

 && 2_2(0)e^2_0^R/2 d y 
 W"((y)) e^-_0^x_2 d y W"((y)) . 
Here we have used Eq.() in Appendix . 



Consequently, we can approximate  as 
 (x_2) . 
 An approximate expression of  can be obtained in a similar way. 
 (x_2) . 
Note that these expressions are continuous at . 

The energy (per unit area) of the configuration  can be well approximated 
by the sum of the tension of the two BPS walls. 
 V_0 && x_2 (_2)^2+(W'())^2 
 +x_2 (_2)^2+(W'())^2  

 2x_2 (_2)^2+(W'())^2 . 
From these expressions, we can also obtain approximate expressions of 
the mode functions , ,  
and  through Eqs.() and (). 
Hence, using all of them, we can calculate all parameters of 
the 3D effective theory with high accuracy. 


Example of wall-antiwall configuration  In this section, we will provide an example of the wall-antiwall 
configuration in a specific model, and demonstrate explicit calculations 
discussed in the previous sections. 
The model we consider here is the following sine-Gordon type model 
. 
  _^2^2 +W()_^2 +h.c. , 
 W()=^3 g^2 g   , 
where a scale parameter  has a mass-dimension one and 
a coupling constant  is dimensionless, and both of them 
are real positive. 
The bosonic part of the model is 
 _bosonic =-^A _A-^4 g^2 
 g  A ^2 .
The target space of the scalar field  has a topology of 
a cylinder as shown in Fig.. 
This model has two supersymmetric vacua at , 
both lie on the real axis. 



   cyld.eps  
 The target space of the scalar field . The lines at 
  are identified with each other. The SUSY vacua 
 are .  
 

There are BPS and anti-BPS walls interpolating these two vacua. 
The BPS wall solution is 
 (x_2)= g 2^-1 e^x_2 - 2  , 
which interpolates from the vacuum at  to 
the one at  
as  increases from  to . 
The anti-BPS wall solution is 
 (x_2)= g -2^-1 e^-x_2 +3 2  , 
which interpolates from  to 
. 
Thus, a field configuration corresponding to the coexistence of these walls 
will wrap around the cylinder of the target space of  
as  goes around . 
Such a topological winding ensures the stability of the configuration. 

Indeed, there is a solution of the equation of motion, 
 ^_A+^3 g g  A  
 g  A =0,  which corresponds to the wall-antiwall system. 
That is, 
 (x_2)= g am  k x_2,k , 
 where  is a real parameter and the function  denotes 
the amplitude function, which is defined as an inverse function of 
 u()=_0^ d  1-k^2^2  . 
For ,  is a monotonically increasing function, 
and has a desired topological winding number. 
The parameter  is related to the radius of the compact space  
through 
 2R=4k  K(k), 
where  is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind. 
In the case of , in other words, 
when the configuration  can be regarded as a wall-antiwall system, 
the parameter  is close to one, and can approximately be written as 
 k1-16e^-R  . 
A profile of  is shown in Fig..



   AclSG2.eps  
 The profile of the classical solution . 
 The dotted lines  and

Solving the mode equation () for this background, 
we can obtain the normalized mode functions of the zero-modes as follows.

  k x_2,k +k k x_2,k  , 
 

 0 (x_2) ^2 gkV_0  
  k x_2,k -k k x_2,k  , 
where functions  and  are the Jacobi's elliptic 
functions. 
The profiles of these mode-functions are shown in Fig.. 
With these expressions, we can calculate all parameters of 
the 3D effective theory by using the formulae (), 
() and (). 



   fermion-mode.eps  
 The profiles of the mode-functions  
  and . 
 

As discussed in Sect., we can introduce matter fields localized 
on the walls. 
Let us introduce a matter chiral superfield  in the 4D bulk theory, 
and assume an interaction to the "wall superfield"  as 

 W_int (,X)= 2 W"()X^2
 =- 2 g   X^2, 
 where a dimensionless constant  is positive. 



The field configuration
 (x_2) g am  k x_2,k , 
 

 A_Xcl  (x_2) 0,  is a static solution of the equation of motion. 
Solving the mode equations () for this background, 
we can obtain the mode functions of the zero-modes for the matter fields 
as follows. 
 0 (x_2)C_X  k x_2,k 
 +k k x_2,k  ^, 

 0 (x_2))C_X  k x_2,k 
 -k k x_2,k  ^, 
where  is a common normalization factor(
The definition of  here is different from that in Eq.() 
by a factor of .

From these expressions, we can obtain the mass eigenvalue of  
defined in Eq.() as 
 2m_0^2 1- =1-k^2 k^2 ^2. 
This coincides with the result of Ref.. 

Fig. shows the ratio  
as a function of . 
From this plot, we can see that  
in the region of . 
This means that a tachyonic mode appears in the effective theory, 
and the classical background () is not stable 
in this region. 



   lstrto.eps  
 The ratio  as a function of . 
 

In the case of , the background is stable 
since . 
Here, note that  itself is not the coupling constant 
between  and . 
Indeed,  in Eq.() is expanded as  
 W_int (,X)=-g 2 X^2+, 
where ellipsis denotes higher dimensional operators suppressed 
by the scale . 
Thus, the true coupling constant is . 
Therefore, the large value of  does not represent the strong coupling 
region as long as  is small. 

In this model, an exact solution () is known. 
In general, however, it is not easy to find such a non-BPS solution 
because we must solve a second order differential equation. 
On the other hand, BPS wall solutions can easily be found 
at least numerically since the BPS equation is a first order 
differential equation. 
As we explained in the previous section, we can calculate 
the parameters of the 3D effective theory with high accuracy 
by using only the BPS wall solutions  and . 
For example, an approximate expression of  can be obtained 
from Eq.() as 
 (x_2)  
   . 
 and the mode functions can also be approximated in a similar way. 


Interaction with the gauge supermultiplet  In this section, we will derive the 3D effective theory 
including a gauge supermultiplet. 
For simplicity, we will discuss an abelian gauge theory. 
An extension to the non-abelian case is straightforward. 
Let us introduce a vector superfield  
in the 4D bulk theory. 
In the Wess-Zumino gauge, its component fields are denoted as 
 V(x^,,)=-^v_ +i^2 -i^2+1 2 ^2^2 D. 
When we consider interactions with fields 
localized on the BPS wall , it is useful to expand 
 as V(x^,,)
 =e^-_1_2_2 
 _2^(1) (x^m,x_2,_1)+_2^2^(1) (x^m,x_2,_1) , 
 where
 ^(1) _(x^m,x_2,_1) 
 -i_(3) ^m_1 _v_m-_1^2_1 , 
 

 ^(1) (x^m,x_2,_1) 
 -v_2-_1_2-1 2 _1^2 D. 
Here, 3D Majorana-like spinors  and , 
which still have the -dependence, are defined 
by the decomposition,(
The notations of  and  are different from those 
in Ref.. 
)  
 ^= e^i/2  2  (_2^+i_1^). 
Using the 4D gauge transformation, we can eliminate the 3D scalar  
except for its zero-mode . 

In this case, the 4D superfield 
strength  can be written as 
 W_(y^,)=-i 2  e^i/2 
 e^-_1_2_2 e^-i_2D_1+i_2^2_2 
 u^(1) _(x^m,x_2,_1)+iw^(1) _(x^m,x_2,_1) , 
where  and  are 3D gauge invariant quantities 
and defined as 
 u^(1) _(x^m,x_2,_1)e^_1Q_1 _2 
 =D_1 ^(1) +_2^(1) _

 _2 -_1 D +i_(3) ^m_1 _v_m2 
 +_1^2i 2 _(3) ^m_m_2 _ -_2_1  ,  

 w^(1) _(x^m,x_2,_1)e^_1Q_1 _1 
 =1 4 D_1^2^(1) _ +i 2 _(3) ^m_m^(1)  _

 _1 +_(3) ^mn _1 _v_mn 
 -i 2 _1^2_(3) ^m_m_1 _.
Here,  is a 4D field strength. 

Similarly, when we consider interactions with fields localized 
on the anti-BPS wall , the following expansion is useful. 
 V(x^,,)
 =e^_1_2_2 
 -_1^(2) (x^m,x_2,_2)+_1^2^(2) (x^m,x_2,_2) ,
where 
 ^(2) _(x^m,x_2,_2) 
 -i_(3) ^m_2 _v_m-_2^2_2 , 
 

 ^(2) (x^m,x_2,_2) 
 -v_2-_2_1-1 2 _2^2 D. 

In this case,  can be written as 
 W_(y^,)=-i 2  e^i/2 
 e^_1_2_2 e^i_1D_2+i_1^2_2 
 u^(2) _(x^m,x_2,_2)-iw^(2) _(x^m,x_2,_2) , 
where  and  are another 3D gauge invariant 
quantities, and defined as 
 u^(2) _(x^m,x_2,_2)e^_2Q_2 _1 
 =-D_2 ^(2) -_2^(2) _

 _1 +_2 D -i_(3) ^m_2 _v_m2 
 +_2^2i 2 _(3) ^m_m_1 _ +_2_2  ,  

 w^(2) _(x^m,x_2,_2)e^_2Q_2 _2 
 =1 4 D_2^2^(2) _ +i 2 _(3) ^m_m^(2)  _

 _2 +_(3) ^mn _2 _v_mn 
 -i 2 _2^2_(3) ^m_m_2 _.
 
The kinetic terms for the gauge supermultiplet can be rewritten 
in terms of  and , 
i.e.   and , as 
 S^V_kin  ^4 xd ^2
 1 4 W^W_+h.c.  

 ^3 xd ^2_1
 1 2 (u^(1) )^2-(w^(1) )^2 .  Here we have assumed a minimal gauge kinetic function, for simplicity. 

Similarly, Eq.() can also be rewritten 
in terms of  and , 
i.e.   and , as 
 S^V_kin  = ^3 xd ^2_2 
 1 2 (u^(2) )^2-(w^(2) )^2 .  In this case, the mode-expansion of the gauge supermultiplet is trivial. 
That is, 
 ^(1) (x^m,x_2,_1) 
 1 2R  ^(1) _(0) (x^m,_1) 

 &&+_n=1 ^1 R  
 nx_2 R ^(1) _(n+) (x^m,_1)
 +nx_2 R ^(1) _(n-) (x^m,_1) , 

 ^(1) (x^m,x_2,_1) 
 1 2R  ^(1) _(0) (x^m,_1) 

 &&+_n=1 ^1 R  
 nx_2 R ^(1) _(n+) (x^m,_1) 
 +nx_2 R ^(1) _(n-) (x^m,_1) . 

 The mode-expansions of  and  
can be done in a similar way. 

Next, we will consider the gauge interaction with the matter field . 
In the 4D bulk theory, it is written as 
 S_matter ^V=^4 xd ^2d ^2 X e^2qV X, 
 where  is a gauge coupling constant. 

Notice that the abelian gauge symmetry should be represented as 
an  symmetry in our case since 3D superfields are real. 
Thus, the vector superfield  discussed so far should be understood 
as a  matrix, 
 V=V_R 0 -i i 0 , 
where  is a real vector superfield. 
The matter superfield  should be understood as a 2-component column vector 
whose gauge transformation is 
 X-2q0 -i i 0  X, 
where  is a transformation parameter, which is a chiral superfield. 

Then, by substituting Eqs.() and () 
into Eq.() and carrying out the -integration, 
the following expression can be obtained. 
 S_matter ^V ^3xd ^2_1d x_2
 D_1^ ^(1) _X D_1 ^(1) _X
 +2 ^(1) _X_2^(1) _X  
 +2q ^(1) _X^(1) D_1^(1) _X  . 
 
 &&.
 - ^(1) (2q^(1) -q^2^(1)2 )^(1) . 
In order to derive the 3D effective theory, 
we should substitute mode-expansions () 
and () 
into the above expression. 
Note that there are a lot of light modes in the gauge supermultiplet 

when the compactified radius  is large compared to the wall width. 
They will remain to be the dynamical degrees 
of freedom after the massive matter modes are integrated out.  


As a result, the interaction terms with the gauge supermultiplet 
can be obtained as follows.

Summary and discussion  We have provided a useful method for the derivation 
of the effective theory in a system 
where BPS and anti-BPS domain walls coexist. 
Although the corresponding field configuration  is non-BPS, 
it can approximately be regarded as a BPS wall or an anti-BPS wall  
in the neighborhood of each domain wall. 
So the light modes localized on one of the walls 
form (approximate) supermultiplets for the corresponding 3D  SUSY. 


Due to the existence of the other wall, however, 
such approximate SUSYs are broken. 

Thus, the 3D effective theory for this system consists of two parts; 
a supersymmetric part described by 3D superfields and 
a SUSY breaking part. 
All parameters of the effective theory can be calculated systematically 
in our method. 







The SUSY breaking terms can be classified into two types. 
The first-type ones involve only modes localized on the same wall. 
Such terms are induced due to the deviation of the background 
from the BPS wall, 
which is mainly characterized by  or  
in Eq.(). 
Indeed, all parameters for such terms  
are expressed by overlap integrals involving  or . 
The second-type ones are 
direct couplings between modes localized on the different walls. 
Both types of the SUSY breaking terms receive 
an exponential suppression in terms of 
the ratio of the wall distance  to the wall width .(
In the model discussed in Sect., 
. ) 
In particular, all SUSY breaking terms vanish at tree-level 
in the "thin-wall" limit, i.e.  . 
This situation corresponds to the pseudo-supersymmetry  
discussed in Ref..  
In this limit, SUSY breaking is induced through the loop effects 
involving the bulk fields, such as the gauge field 
discussed in Sect.. 
In the case that  is finite, on the other hand, 


the tree-level terms of SUSY breaking discussed in this paper arise 
besides the loop-induced ones. 
It depends on the ratio  whether the tree-level ones dominate 
over the loop-induced ones or not. 



From the SUSY breaking mass terms calculated in our method, we have shown that 
maximal mixings occur between the bosonic zero-modes localized 
on the different walls, while the fermionic zero-modes remain to be localized 
on each wall. 
This means that oscillations will occur between the bosonic modes localized 
on the different walls(
This is a similar situation to the one in Ref. 
where the multi-BPS-wall configurations are considered.) . 

An effective theory on the domain wall can also be derived 
by using the nonlinear realization technique for the space-time symmetries. 
In particular, we can obtain an effective theory on a BPS wall 
by regarding the existence of the wall 
as the partial SUSY breaking. 
This method is powerful for the general discussion of the BPS walls 
because it uses only information on symmetries. 
The relation between this method and the mode-expansion method 
 is discussed in Ref.. 
Similarly, we can derive an effective theory on a non-BPS  wall 
by the nonlinear realization method. 
Since the wall-antiwall system is non-BPS, 
we can apply this method to our case. 
However, the nonlinear realization method cannot respect a specific structure 
of the configuration, such as the wall-antiwall structure. 
Thus, in order to discuss the specific features of the wall-antiwall system, 
we have to take the mode-expansion method as we have done in this paper.  
If you would like to know the relation between our result and 
the result of Ref., 
you should combine our method with the result of Ref.. 

In this paper, we have concentrated ourselves on the case 
that the Ka hler potential is minimal, for simplicity. 
An extension to the non-minimal Ka hler case is possible, 
although the classical background  and the mode functions 
cannot be obtained analytically in that case. 
Thus, the BPS-wall approximation discussed in Sect. 
is useful in such a case because solving the BPS equations 
(the first order differential equations) is much easier than 
solving the equations of motion (the second order differential equations) 
in the numerical calculation. 

When we introduce the matter fields, we must take care of 
the strength of the couplings between the matter and the wall fields. 
As we have demonstrated in Sect., 
a weak coupling between them leads to a tachyonic scalar mode 
in the effective theory. 
This means that the background field configuration is unstable 
unless the matter modes are strongly localized on the walls. 
Roughly speaking, if the matter modes are localized 
within the wall width , the background is stable. 
Therefore, the fat brane scenario is allowed 
in the wall-antiwall system. 
Using the above tachyonic mode as the "Higgs" field, 
it might be possible to propose a new mechanism of symmetry breaking. 





In the superstring theory, it is well-known that 
BPS D-branes can be described by the kink solutions 
in the tachyon field theory. 
In particular, a system where D brane and anti-D brane coexist 
is represented by a wall-antiwall solution 
in an effective field theory on a non-BPS D-brane. 
Thus, our method discussed here is useful 
in the discussion of the tachyon condensation 
in the superstring theory. 


In order to construct a more realistic model, we have to investigate 
a wall-antiwall system in a 5D SUSY theory. 
However, 5D SUSY theories are difficult to handle 
because they have many SUSY (at least eight supercharges).  
In fact, 5D SUSY theories are required to be nonlinear sigma models 
in order to have a BPS domain wall, 
due to their restrictive forms of the scalar potential. 
However, our approach suggests how to derive the 4D effective theory 
for the wall-antiwall system, 
once we find a method for deriving an effective theory on a BPS wall 
in five dimensions.  
Expanding the discussion to the supergravity is also an interesting 
subject.

Notations  
Basically, we follow the notations of Ref. 
for the 4D bulk theory. 
Notations for 3D theories  
The notations for the 3D theories are as follows. 

We take the space-time metric as 
 ^mn =(-1,+1,+1). 
The 3D -matrices, , 
can be written by the Pauli matrices as 
 _(3) ^0=^2, 
 _(3) ^1=-i^3, 
 _(3) ^3=i^1, 
and these satisfy the 3D Clifford algebra, 
 _(3) ^m,_(3) ^n =-2^mn . 
The spinor indices are raised and lowered by multiplying  
from the left. 
 _^2 _ ^, 
 ^^2 ^ _. 
We take the following convention of the contraction of spinor indices. 
 _1_2_1^_2 
 =^2 _ _1^_2^
Properties of   Here, we collect some properties of the classical 
configuration . 



The equation of motion for the classical solution  is  
 _2^2W "(A _cl )=0. 
By multiplying  with this equation, 
we will obtain 
 1 2 _2_2^2-W'()^2 =0. 
This means that 
 _2^2-W'()^2=c,  where  is a real constant. 
In the case that  is a BPS wall configuration, 
we can see that  from the BPS equation. 
For the wall-antiwall configuration,  is a tiny constant. 
Typically, it is exponentially suppressed by the wall distance . 
In the model discussed in Sect., for instance, 
 c=^2 gk  ^2(1-k^2)
 16^4 g^2 e^-R . 
In particular, in the case of the real configuration 
mainly discussed in this paper, Eq.() can be rewritten as 
 (x_2)(x_2)=V_00 (x_2)0 (x_2)=c.  
Thus,  is related to  in Eq.() through 
 c=V_0 2R .  Under the assumption (), 
the following relations hold. 

 W"((x_2-R)) -W"((x_2)), 

 W"((-x_2)) W"((x_2)),  W"'((x_2-R))=W"'((x_2)). The upper sign in R.H.S. of Eq.() corresponds to the case that 
the configuration  is stable, 
and the lower sign corresponds to the case of an unstable configuration, 
respectively. 

Thus, together with Eq.(), 
we can obtain the following relation. 
 W"'() (x_2-R) 
 =-W"'() (x_2).   100
