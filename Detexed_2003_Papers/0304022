ABSTRACT 

      We investigate a large class of supersymmetric magnetic brane
solutions supported by  gauge fields in AdS gauged
supergravities.  We obtain first-order equations in terms of a
superpotential. In particular, we find systems which interpolate
between AdS (where  or )
at the horizon and AdS-type geometry in the asymptotic region,
for . The boundary geometry of the AdS-type
metric is Minkowski. This provides smooth
supergravity solutions for which the boundary of the AdS spacetime
compactifies spontaneously.  These solutions indicate the
existence of a large class of superconformal field theories in
diverse dimensions whose renormalization group flow runs from the
UV to the IR fixed-point.  We show that the same set of
first-order equations also admits solutions which are
asymptotically AdS but singular at small
distance. This implies that the stationary AdS
 solutions typically lie on the inflection points of the
modulus space.

Introduction 

        Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime has a natural boundary which,
under the Poincare patch, is a Minkowski spacetime.  This provides a
simple but non-trivial example with which the holographic principle
can be tested through the AdS/CFT correspondence
. Since AdS spacetime can exist in
higher-dimensions ( in supergravities), it is worth
studying the possibility of spontaneous compactification of the AdS
boundary.  Any Ricci-flat perturbation on the boundary is consistent
with the equations of motion of pure Einstein gravity with a negative
cosmological constant. It is of interest to obtain solutions in gauged
supergravities whose asymptotic geometry is described by the metric

ds^2_D = e^2k z  ds_D-1 ^2 + dz^2,
where the metric  is not Ricci-flat.  This metric cannot
be Einstein for general , since the corresponding Ricci-tensor is
given by

R_ab  &=& e^-2k z  R_ab  - (D-1) k^2 _ab 

R_zz  &=& - (D-1) k^2.

However, at the boundary with , the spacetime
is Einstein even for non-vanishing , provided that it is
smooth. In this paper, we consider boundary metrics of the type

ds_D-1 ^2 = dx^ dx_+ ^-2  d_2^2,

where  is the metric of a two-sphere , hyperbolic
two-plane  or two-torus . We will refer to the metric
(), with the boundary given by (), as
the AdS-type metric.

    Brane solutions whose boundary metric is given by
() have been studied in various dimensions

. They are all supported by a set of 2-form field
strengths, which are proportional to the volume of ,
together with a set of scalars and a superpotential. Thus, these
solutions can be viewed as the magnetic duals of the AdS black hole
solutions obtained in.  Smooth
and supersymmetric solutions of this type have hitherto been limited
to , with the exception of a smeared NS5-brane on 
.

        The case of , with the radius given by ,
provides a simple procedure for wrapping extra dimensions. This
enables one to make contact between -dimensional gauged
supergravities and -dimensional quantum field theories. In
fact, investigations into the possibility that our  world arises
as a spontaneous compactification of a  theory on
Minkowski has a long history . In 1953, Pauli attempted,
in one of his many unpublished works, to obtain an  Yang-Mills
field from such a compactification of pure six-dimensional Einstein
gravity. Such a solution was later obtained in,
where additional gauge and Higgs fields, together with a scalar
potential, were added. A six-dimensional supergravity theory with such
a solution was constructed in. However, the string or
M-theory origin of this supergravity theory remained to be
understood. In this paper, we have obtained brane solutions in 
gauged supergravity whose boundary is precisely the metric
().  This suggests that the effective action at the
boundary (with an UV cut-off for inducing gravity) of our brane
solution is precisely the aforementioned six-dimensional gauged
supergravity.

         We use a simple method to obtain first-order equations which
describe such solutions and obtain smooth solutions for which
 is the metric for an , as well as an  and
. We begin by performing a Kaluza-Klein reduction on ,
keeping only the singlet of the group action . The resulting
-dimensional theory consists of the metric and a set of scalars
with a scalar potential. We find that there exists a superpotential,
which enables us to obtain the first-order equations for a domain wall
solution. Lifting this system back to  dimensions yields a magnetic
-brane.

       With this method, we obtain the first-order equations for a
large class of solutions, which include previously-known solutions as
well as new ones. Although we have not found the most general
analytical solutions, their qualitative structures can easily be
investigated. In particular, numerical analysis shows that there is a
large class of solutions which smoothly interpolate between AdS
 geometry in the horizon and AdS-type geometry in
the asymptotic region, where  can be  or  and
. There are also solutions which have the asymptotic
geometry AdS and are singular at small
distance. The stationary solutions of AdS with
constant scalars and their M-theory and string theory interpretation
have already been reported in a letter.

         This paper is organized as the follows.  In the next section,
we re-derive magnetic brane solutions in -dimensional AdS
Einstein-Maxwell gravity by using the -dimensional
superpotential. In sections 3 and 4, we use the superpotential
method to find single-charge and two-equal-charge branes in
-dimensional AdS gauged supergravities, respectively. In
sections 5-8, we consider general multi-charge branes in various
dimensions. Analytical solutions are found for the single-charge
branes, whereas numerical analysis is used when there are multiple
charges. The ten and eleven dimensional origins of our solutions
are described in section 9. Conclusions are presented in section
10.

Branes in AdS Einstein-Maxwell gravity 

         Let us consider a -dimensional theory with the Lagrangian

e^-1  L = R - 1 2n!  F_^2 +
,

where , 
and the cosmological constant is given by . We perform a
dimensional reduction on an -dimensional space with the ansatz

ds_D ^2 &=& e^2   ds_D-n ^2 +
^-2  e^2   d_n^2,

F_&=& m^-n _, 
where

= -n 2(D-2)(D-n-2)  , = -(D-n-2) n . 
The reduction is consistent and the resulting -dimensional
Lagrangian becomes

e^-1  L  = R - 12 ()^2 - V(),
where the scalar potential is given by
V= 12 ^2 m^2 e^2(D-n-1)  -
n(n-1)
^2 e^2(D-2) n   -
e^2 .
The constant ,  or , corresponding to
 being the metric for a unit -sphere, hyperbolic
-plane or -torus, respectively. We would like to express the
scalar potential () in terms of a superpotential
. Namely,

V=(W  )^2 - D-n-1 2(D-n-2)  W^2.

We find that this to be possible only for , in which case the
superpotential is given by

W=D-2 D-3   ( m e^(D-3)   +
2 ^2 m^-1  e^  ), 
provided that the constraint 
 is satisfied.  Note that, in the case of  which
corresponds to a 2-torus, the 2-form field strength vanishes. In fact,
in this case we find that, if we do turn on , then there is a
superpotential only in eleven dimensions, which is given by

W=1 22  (3m e^-8 37    +
 m^-1  e^27   ).

Though a curious feature, since there is no vector field in the
eleven-dimensional sector of M-theory we shall not further
consider this case.

    We can now construct a domain wall solution in  dimensions,
with the metric ansatz

ds_D-2 ^2 = e^2A  dx^  dx_+ dy^2,

where  and  are assumed to depend only on the
transverse coordinate . The equations of motion are given by

&&+ (D-3) A' = V  , A" + (D-3) A'^2 = -V D-4 ,

&&12 - (D-3) (D-4) A'^2 = V,

where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to . Since the
scalar potential can be expressed in terms of a superpotential,
these second-order equations can be solved by the first-order
equations

W  ,A'=-1 2 (D-4)  W. 

    We lift these equations of motion back to -dimensions,
expressed in terms of the coordinate  such that the solution
takes the form

ds_D^2 &=& e^2u  dx^ dx_+ e^2v  ^-2 
d_2^2 + d^2,

F_&=& m^-2  _.
 
The first-order equations for the functions  and  are given
by

du d =-2^2 - m^2
e^-2v  m 2(D-2)(D-3)   ,dv d =-2^2 + (D-3) m^2
e^-2v  m2(D-2)(D-3)  , which have the solution

e ^2v =e ^-4 ^2 m 2
(D-2)(D-3)     - (D-3)m^2  2
^2 ,u=-2(D-2) (D-3)^3  
^2 m  v D-3 . 
With the new coordinate , the
solution can be expressed as

ds_D^2&=&( r)^2
H^D-2 D-3  dx_ ^2+dr^2 ( r)^2 H^2 +r^2
d_2^2,

F_&=& m ^-2 _ =
 2(D-1) D-3    _, 
where .  It is interesting
to note that, once the cosmological constant is fixed, there is no
free parameter associated with the  field strength.  This is
rather different from the standard brane solution, in which the charge
of a supporting field strength is typically an arbitrary integration
constant. In the present case, it is uniquely determined by a
supersymmetric condition, which translates into the condition
presented below (). For vanishing , the above
solution is purely gravitational with locally AdS geometry.

    The second derivative of the function  with respect to the
co-moving coordinate  is given by

d^2u d^2  = 2 H (D-2)(D-3) r^2 .

We find that, for , .  For ,
we have .  In both cases, the solution is regular
everywhere.  On the other hand, if , then 
 and the solution is singular.  Thus, there seems to be a clear
correlation between the singularity structure and the sign of
.  This is rather different from supersymemtric domain
wall solutions where  is always
non-positive regardless the singularity structure
.

    These solutions are among those that have already been found in
 by solving the D-dimensional equations of motion
directly (To recover the notation of, let
 and .) , and the
corresponding Killing spinors have been determined in
. The cases of the  magnetic string and the 
"cosmic monopole" can be embedded in  gauged supergravity
.

Single-charge branes in AdS gauged supergravities 

        The above analysis is only applicable in gauged supergravities
in  and , since in gauged supergravities in , the
2-form field strengths always have a dilaton coupling.  In general, a
2-form field strength couples to a dilatonic scalar in the following
fashion:

L =-14 e^-a   F_^2, 
where the constant  can be parameterized as
a^2=- 2(D-3) D-2 .
Here,  takes the values  with .  In
, the  solitons are considered as
building blocks, while the  solitons are considered as
threshold binding states of these basic building blocks, since the
field strength associated with  can be viewed as linear
combinations of those with .  In this section and the next,
we consider magnetic brane solutions in AdS gauged supergravities
supported by a field strength whose dilaton coupling is
characterized as  and . Hence, they can be viewed as
single-charge and two-equal-charge branes, respectively.

          The relevant Lagrangian can be expressed as

e^-1  L  = R - 12()^2 -
14 e^-a_1   F_^2 - V(), 
where  is given by  in ().  The scalar
potential can be expressed in terms of a superpotential

V=(W  )^2 - D-1 2(D-2) W^2,

and  is given by

W=2g(1 a_1  e^12 a_1   -
1 a_2  e^12 a_2  ).

The value of , which can be determined by examining the
gauged supergravities in  and 5, is given by

a_1 a_2= -2(D-3) D-2 .

We can reduce the theory on  with the ansatz

ds_D^2 &=& e^2   ds_D-2 ^2 +
^-2  e^2  d_2^2,

F_&=& m ^-2  _,=
-1 (D-2)(D-4)  ,= -12 (D-4)
. 
The -Lagrangian is given by

e^-1  L &=& R-12 ^2 -
12()^2 -V,

V&=&12^2 m^2 e^-a_1 +
2(D-3)    -
2^2 e^(D-2)  +
V e^2  .

As in the previous discussion,  for  and
 for .  Now it amounts to finding a superpotential
 such that

V=(W  )^2 + (W  )^2
-D-3 2(D-4)   W^2. 
The superpotential exists, provided that  and  satisfy
() and that ,  and  satisfy

(2^4 -m^2 g^2) (D-2) a_1^2 - 2(D-3) m^2 g^2=0.

The superpotential is given by

W= 2a_1 (D-2) ^2 g (2(D-3) +
a_1^2 (D-2))  e^-12 a_1 + (D-3)  
+ e^ W . 
It is worth noting that the existence of the superpotential only
depends on the condition (), rather than on any specific
value of .

      In the case of a single-charge brane,  and hence
. The constraint () becomes

^2=2 a_1^-1  m g,

and the superpotential reduces to

W=1 2 me^-12 a_1 +
(D-3)   +  e^ W
. 
The first-order equations for the -dimensional system are
therefore given by

W  ,W  ,A'=-1 2 (D-4)  W.  

      Having obtained the first-order equations for the
-dimensional domain walls, it is of interest to lift these
equations to  dimensions so that they correspond to magnetic
branes.  The brane solutions have the structure

ds_D^2 &=&e^2u  dx^ dx^ _  + e^2v  
^-2 d_2^2 + d^2,

F_&=& m ^-2 _=
 a_1 2 g  _,
where the functions  and  and the dilaton  depend only on
the coordinate .  They satisfy the first-order equations

d d &=&2 (-122  ma_1
e^-12a_1 - 2v  + dW d ),

dv d &=&-1 2 (D-2) (12 
m(D-3)e^-12a_1 - 2v  + W),

du d &=&12 (D-2)  (12 
me^-12a_1 - 2v -W).
Note that the  fields form a closed system.
() can be solved explicitly by making the coordinate
transformation .
Defining

Fe ^1 2 (a_2-a_1) ,Ge ^1 2 (a_1+a_2)+2v , 
we find that the first two equations in () yield

G'+ m+ G=0, 
where . The solution is

G=e ^- y - m  .

We have absorbed a trivial integration constant by a constant shift in
the coordinate .  The dilaton equation of motion gives

1 a_1-a_2 F' F = m
a_1 4G +g 2  (1-F^-1 ). 
Plugging in  we find that, for ,

F=e ^- y -D-3 D-5  
m  +c_1 e ^12(D-5) y  G .

This yields







e ^2u =c_2 e ^- y e ^-1 2 (a_1+a_2)  ,e ^2v =(e ^- y - m  )e ^-1 2  (a_1+a_2)  .

The metric of the solution can be expressed as

ds_D^2 = (g r)^2 H^-1 D-2  (dx_^2 + (1 -
 m  (g r)^2 ) ^-2 
d_2^2) + H^D-3 D-2   4dr^2 ^2
r^2 , 
where

H=1 -  m  (g r)^2  1 -
D-3 D-5   m  (g r)^2  +
c_1 (g r)^D-3   ,
and the dilaton is given by

e ^1 2 (a_1-a_2) =H, 
with the new coordinate . This
solution is valid for ; we shall present the 
solution momentarily.  To understand the solution better, it is
instructive to write the function , where the
definitions of  and  can be straightforwardly read off
from (). Then the metric can be expressed as

ds_D^2 = H^-1 D-2   W^1 D-2  [ (g
r)^2 (dx^ dx_+ H ^-2  d_2^2) +
H W^-1  4dr^2 ^2 r^2 ].
 
Thus, the solution can be viewed as an intersection of a domain wall,
characterized by the function , and a -brane, characterized
by the function .

         Clearly, the asymptotic infinite region of the metric is
, in which case  and the metric
behaves as

ds_D^2=(gr)^2 (dx^ dx^+ ^-2 
d_2^2) + dr^2 ^2 r^2 . 
If , in which case  is the metric of a
2-torus, then the above metric describes locally AdS
spacetime. For , the above metric can be viewed as a
domain wall wrapped on .

       The full solution with , also obtained in
, describes a domain wall.  This can be viewed as a
distribution of branes from the ten or eleven-dimensional point of
view. Hence, this solution corresponds to the Coulomb branch of the
superconformal Yang-Mills theory on the boundary
.

       For , the metric is regular everywhere provided
that the constant .  The corresponding metric interpolates
between AdS at small distance to the
AdS-type metric () at large distance.  When 
is non-vanishing, the  term can dominate at small distance
and hence the metric can become singular.

       For , the solution is always singular at small
distance.  The singularity can be naked if  vanishes at the
singularity but can coincide with the horizon if  is divergent at
the singularity.  The nature of the singularity depends on the
specific value of the constant .

        Let us now look at the examples of  and  in
detail.

3-brane in  

   This solution was also obtained in.  In this case, the
dilaton and the function  are given by

e ^5 3   =H= 1 - 
m  (g r)^2  1 - 2 m  (gr)^2 
+ c_1 (g r)^4  . 
For  and , the metric is regular everywhere, which
approaches AdS at small distance.  For , the
metric has a singularity which is naked if  and which coincides
with a horizon if . The structure of the singularity is
qualitatively the same as the domain wall singularity corresponding to
.

     If we set  and rescale the coordinates as the following:

resc 
gr k g r,x^1 k 
x^,

then by sending  we obtain the geometry
AdS with a constant dilaton.  If we instead take
 then, after sending ,
we obtain the solution

ds_7^2 &=& (gr)^2  H^1/5   dx^ dx_+
m ^2H^1/5   d_2^2 +
 H^4/5 4dr^2 ^2r^2 ,

H^-1  &=& 2 + c_1 (gr)^2 . 
When , the metric becomes AdS,
where AdS approaches the boundary.  Depending on the sign of 
, the metric approaches a singularity at  or at some finite
value .  In both cases, the singularity coincides with a
horizon. However, for  the metric components of 
diverge while, for , they vanish.

     This is rather different from our previous solution ()
with , in that the structure of AdS occurs at the
asymptotic region instead of at the horizon.  It is rather interesting
that the AdS can be in both the IR region, as in
(), and in the UV region, as in (). This indicates
that the stationary solution AdS lies on the inflection
point of the modulus space.

      For , the function  has a simpler form when
, where . In this case,

H=(1 - m  (g r)^2 )^-1 .

Thus, the singularity at small distance coincides with the
horizon. Clearly, for , the denominator of  in
() approaches zero first and hence the singularity coincides
with the horizon.  On the other hand, for  the numerator
of  in () approaches zero first and hence the singularity
is naked.

Membrane in  

    In this case, the dilaton and the function  are given by

H6  e ^8 5   =H= 1 -
 m  (g r)^2  1 - 3
m  (gr)^2  + c_1 (g r)^3  . 
The singularity structure is similar to that of . For 
 and , we recover a smooth solution that goes to
AdS in the IR limit. For , the denominator of
 in () is strictly positive and we have a naked
singularity. On the other hand, for  the singularity is
located on the horizon.

If we set  and perform the rescaling (), then for
 we obtain the geometry AdS with a constant
dilaton. If we instead take , then
after sending  we obtain the solution

ds_6^2 &=& (gr)^2  H^1/4   dx^ dx_+
m ^2H^1/4   d_2^2 +
 H^3/4 4dr^2 ^2r^2 ,

H^-1  &=& 3 + c_1 gr ,  
which approaches AdS in the asymptotic region, where
AdS approaches the boundary. The short-distance behavior is
dependent on . More precisely, while the singularity
coincides with the horizon for positive and negative , for
 the length parameter of  diverges at the
singularity. On the other hand, for  it vanishes.  Thus,
as in the case of , the AdS solution appears in
both the IR and UV regimes.

Finally, the case of  can be described in terms of the
parameter . For  there is a
naked singularity while, for , the singularity
coincides with a horizon.

String in  

One can find the string solution in a manner analogous to the
previous cases, with the coordinate transformation 
. The resulting metric has the
form () for  but with the dilaton and the
function  given by

e ^3 2   =H=1 - 
m 3 g^2 r   1 + (c_1 -  m 3 g (g r)) (g r)^-1  ,  
where .  This solution was
obtained and analyzed in.  Here, we make a further
observation for  that if we make the rescaling
(), accompanied by 
, then after sending  the function  becomes
 and the metric ()
becomes

ds_5^2 = (gr)^2 H^1/3   dx^ dx_+
m  ^2H^1/3   d_2^2 +
H^2/3 4dr^2 ^2r^2 . 

Black hole in  

In this case we have

e ^4 3   =H=1 -
m  (gr)^2  1 + c_1 g r  + 
m  (g r)^2  .  
The metric is clearly singular regardless of the sign of
. For , the singularity always coincides
with the horizon. For , the singularity is naked if
 but coincides with the
horizon if .

     For , we can make the rescaling ()
accompanied by .  Then, after sending
, the function  and
the metric () becomes

ds_4^2 = (gr)^2 H^1/2   dx^ dx_+
m  ^2H^1/3   d_2^2 +
H^1/2 4dr^2 ^2r^2 . 
This is the standard single-charge AdS black hole obtained in
.  Thus, our solution is more general than the
previously-known AdS black hole.

Two-equal-charge branes in AdS gauged supergravities 

           For the case of a brane with two equal charges, 
and hence . The constraint () becomes

^2=a_1^-1  mg ,

and the superpotential () becomes

W=me^-12 a_1 + (D-3)  
+  e^ W . 

         The first-order equations for the -dimensional system
are therefore given by (). Having obtained the first-order
equations for the domain walls, it is of interest to lift these
equations back to give rise to the first-order equations for the
magnetic branes, whose structure is given by ().  The
higher-dimensional equations of motion are given by

d d &=&2 (-12  ma_1
e^-12a_1 - 2v  + dW d ),

dv d &=&-1 2 (D-2) (
m(D-3)e^-12a_1 - 2v  + W),

du d &=&12 (D-2)  (
me^-12a_1 - 2v -W).
Note that the  fields form a closed system. We can find
exact solutions of this system only in particular cases. In the case
of , the system can be solved exactly but the form of the
solution is not very illuminating. However, a simple
partial solution for  is given by

y,d dy =e ^-/2 . 

Domain wall solution 

For , and therefore vanishing flux, the first-order
equations () can be solved straightforwardly by
making the coordinate transformation

de ^D-4 4 a_1  . 
After applying a second coordinate transformation, 
, the
solution can be expressed as






e ^ =H^a_1 ,  
where  and  has absorbed a constant
factor. In the above, we have used the convention that . This
is a domain wall solution which was obtained in.

Asymptotic boundary region 

For , we do not find analytical solutions.  Here, we
shall present the asymptotic behavior at the boundary of the
metric. Making the coordinate transformation 
, we express the metric () as

ds_D^2=e ^2u  (dx^  dx^ _ 
+dy^2)+e ^2v ^-2 d_2^2.  
When  the boundary conditions are 
, and . The solution
of () can be solved near  as an expansion. For
, the result is

e^2u &=&(D-3)^2 (D-2)g^2 y^2 (1 +
2 mg 3c^2 (D-3)2(D-2)   y^2 +
),

e^2v &=& (D-3)^2 c^2 (D-2)g^2y^2 
(1- mg(3D-8) 3c^2(D-3)2(D-2)  
y^2 + ),

e^&=& 1 + 2mg c^2(D-3)(D-5)  y^2 +
, 
where  is an arbitrary integration constant which measures the
relative scale size of  and .  When
, the solution of () is given by the expansion

e^2u  &=& 4 3g^2y^2  (1 +
mg 36c^2 y^2
+),

e^2v  &=& 4c^2 3g^2 y^2 
(1 -7mg 66c^2 
y^2 + ),

&=& -12 c^-2  mg y^2(y).
 
In this case, the field  is dual to an operator of dimension
. The solutions of the two-dimensional wave
equation go as  and . Notice that  has
the second solution only for , which is the non-normalizable mode
associated with the operator dual to the field  turned on.

        Having obtained the boundary solution, it is of interest to
examine how the solution flows into the bulk region.  In the case
of , since there is no AdS
fixed-point in the system, the solution can only flow into a
singularity in the bulk. For the case of , there is a
AdS fixed-point and it is natural to expect that
the solution flows into this fixed-point in the bulk.  We shall
examine this in the following.

AdS 

For , there are fixed-point solutions with constant
 and  for ; they are given by






u=-2 g a_1 (D-4) (
D-4 D-3 )^a_1^2/2 ,  
which have the geometry AdS. For , this was
found in. For , such a solution would be
complex.

Interpolating from AdS to AdS 

       It is of interest to study whether these fixed-point
solutions lie in the IR or UV region.  If AdS
lies in the IR region, then it can smoothly flow to the UV region
of the AdS-type solution ().  On the other
hand, if AdS lies in the UV region, then it must
instead flow into a singularity.

       We study this issue by examining the flow of the solution using
the Taylor expansion method.  If we assume that there exists a
solution which is AdS at the asymptotic boundary,
then we can Taylor expand to find the next order in the solution
slightly away from the boundary.  We find the following:

e^2u  &=& (D-4)^2(D-3) D-2  
(D-3)^2D-2   
(D-2) g^2 y^2 (1 + c y^n + ),

e^2v  &=& m (D-4)^D-4 D-2   (D-3)^2D-2   
2(D-2)  g  (1 - 12 c(D-4) y^n + ),

e^ 2(D-2)    &=&
(D-4 D-3 )^1D-2   (
1

&& + 18c (D^2 - 3D -2 + (D-2)D^2 - 2D + 7 ) y^n +
),
where  and the coordinate 
is defined by .  The constant  is a free
parameter determining how fast the solution flows away from the
AdS boundary.  The solution will flow into a singularity
in the IR region.

      Now, we will instead assume that there exists a solution with
AdS on its horizon. Then, expanding away from the
horizon yields

e^2u &=& (D-4)^-2(D-3) D-2   (D-3)^2 D-2  
(D-2) g^2 r^2 (1 + c r^n + ),

e^2v  &=& m (D-4)^D-4 D-2   (D-3)^2D-2   
2(D-2)  g  (1 - 12 c(2D-7 + D^2-2D-7 ) r^n
+ ),

e^ 2(D-2)    &=&
(D-4 D-3 )^1D-2   (1

&& + 18c (D^2 - 5D + (D-4)D^2 - 2D + 7 ) r^n +
),
where  and the coordinate  is
defined by .  The constant  is again a
free parameter determining how fast the solution flows away from
the AdS horizon.  In fact, the solution smoothly flows to
the AdS-type boundary solution ().  We verify
this numerically by using () as our initial data.
For example, Fig.  shows the functions , 
and  for .  We see that the dilaton,
although not constant, is finite. The functions  and 
become linearly dependent on the coordinate when the coordinate
increases as governed by () with .

    (green) for a smooth solution that runs from AdS
 at the horizon to an AdS-type geometry in the asymptotic
   region.   

     To conclude, we find that for two-equal-charge branes
there are two types of solutions.  The first type has
AdS in the UV boundary region but is singular in
the IR region.  The second type interpolates between the
AdS-type solution in the UV region () and the
AdS solution in the IR region.

Two-charge 3-brane in  

     The maximal gauged supergravity in  has  gauge
fields.  We consider the truncation to the two diagonal 
subsector.  The relevant  Lagrangian is given by

e^-1 L _7 = R - 12 (_1)^2 -
12 (_2)^2 -
V -14 _i=1 ^2 X_i^-2  (F_^i)^2,

where  with

a_1=(2, 25 ),a_2=(-2, 25 ).

The scalar potential  is given by
V =g^2 (-4X_1 X_2 - 2 X_0 X_1 - 2 X_0 X_2 + 12
X_0^2) , 
where .  The potential can be expressed in
terms of a superpotential given by

W=g 2  (X_0 + 2X_1 + 2 X_2).


    We can consistently reduce the theory on the  with the same
metric ansatz as before but specializing to . The ansatz for
the two  2-form field strengths is given by

F_^i=  m_i ^-2  _12q_i g^-1  _. 
We obtain the  scalar potential

V=12^2 (_i=1 ^2 m_i^2 X_i^-2 )
e^8    -
2 ^2 e^5   + V
e^2  .

It is straightforward to obtain the corresponding superpotential,
which is given by

W= 2  (_i=1 ^2 m_i X_i^-1  )
e^4   + W e^  ,

provided that the constraint

^2 = (m_1 + m_2)g
is satisfied.  Thus, the charge parameters  have the
constraint .  The first-order equations of the
five-dimensional domain wall are given by

_i'=2 W _i ,W  ,A'=-1 32  W.
Lifting the equations back to  yields the equations of motion
for the 3-brane:

d d  &=& 2(- 22 
(m_1 a_1 X_1^-1  + m_2 a_2 X_2^-1 )
e^-2v  + dW d ),

dv d  &=& -1 52  (22
(m_1 X_1^-1  + m_2 X_2^-1 ) e^-2v  +
W),

du d  &=& 1 52  (
 2 (m_1 X_1^-1  + m_2 X_2^-1 )
e^-2v  - W).  

        In the case of , it is consistent to set
, and the system () reduces to the
 single-charge system discussed in section 3.1. After taking
 and 
, the exact solution is given by ()
and (). This solution was obtained in.  For
, the system reduces to the  two-equal-charge system
discussed in section 3.2.  For general , we do not find
analytical solutions and so it is instructive to study the
solution using numerical approach.

General asymptotic region 

    We begin by determining the asymptotic behavior in the AdS-type
boundary. As discussed in the previous section, we can express the
metric in the form () by making the coordinate
transformation . We have the boundary conditions
, and  for small
. The leading terms in the Taylor expansion of the solution of
() are given by

e^2u  &=& 4 g^2 y^2  ( 1 +
 (m_1 + m_2) g 30 c^2  y^2 + ),

e^2v  &=& 4c^2 g^2 y^2  ( 1 -
13 (m_1+m_2) g 60c^2  y^2 + ),

e^_1 2   &=& 1 +  (m_1 -
m_2)g 8c^2  y^2 + ,
 e^_2 10    &=&
1 +  (m_1 + m_2)g 40c^2  y^2 + , 
where  is an arbitrary integration constant.  The normalizable
solutions for  and  imply that the dual operators are
not turned on.  Next, we examine how these solutions flow from the
above boundary into the bulk.

AdS and AdS 

For , solutions to the equations () with
constant  and  are given by

e ^2 _1 &=&m_2-m_1 (m_2-m_1)^2+m_1
m_2   m_2 ,e ^-5 2  _2 =4 3  cosh (_1/2 ),

e ^-2v &=& -g e ^-3 10  _2   (m_1 e ^-_1 2   +m_2 e ^_1 2   ) ,u=-g 2 e ^-4 10  _2 -2 R_ads  .  
This solution is discussed in detail in.  Note that
the AdS radius  depends on two variables, namely  and
the ratial of the charge parameter .  This is because the
charges of this system are constrained by , as discussed
earlier.  It is invariant under the simultaneous interchanges
 and .  The
reality conditions of the solution constrain the constants  and
, as well as the choice of  in the solution.  Let us first
consider the case , corresponding to  as the
metric of a unit (non-compact) hyperbolic 2-plane.  In this case, the
reality of the solution implies that . This includes
the choices of  (or ) and , which were
discussed in.  The first case gives rise to 
supersymmetry in , while the second case gives rise to 
 supersymmetry.

    Now let us look at the choice of , corresponding to
 as the metric of .  In this case, the reality
conditions for () imply that .  The
condition () implies further that .
Therefore, the AdS solution can only have 
 supersymmetry but cannot arise from the pure  minimal
gauged supergravity.

        If we define a charge parameter , then the
condition for having  versus  can be summarized as the
following:

q[0,2] && H^2,

q(-,0) or  (2,) && S^2.

The solution was lifted to  in, and the
corresponding metric describes a warped product of AdS with a
six-dimensional space which can be viewed as  bundle over
 or .  In the latter case, the solution provides a
concrete example of a supersymmetric and smooth compactification
of M-theory to AdS.

Interpolating from AdS to AdS 

      As discussed above, AdS arises for 
 and .  The special cases of a single
non-vanishing  or  have been discussed in sections 3
and 4, respectively . We now consider the general case of 
with . As in the previous cases, AdS
can occur at either the boundary or the horizon of the AdS. In
order to demonstrate this, we use a special case of ,
 and a positive sign in (). For simplicity, we
also set . As a boundary solution, the Taylor expansion of
the metric components and the scalars goes as

e^2u &=&18 5  (18 125 )^1/5  y^-2  (1 +
c y^n + ),

e^2v  &=& 6 (450)^1/5  (1 -3 2 c y^n + )
,


e^_1 2   &=& 23  (1 -
75c(n+1) 2(25n-68) 
y^n + ),

e^_2 10    &=& (27 50 )^1/10 
(1 -c(n+1) 2(n-4) y^n + ),

where the coordinate  is defined to be  and 
is an arbitrary integration constant.  The constant  can take two
values:  or .  Clearly, this solution will
flow into a singularity in the bulk.

     On the other hand, as a solution near the horizon, we find that
the Taylor expansion of the next to leading order is given by

e^2u &=&18 5  (18 125 )^1/5  r^2 (1 +
c r^n + ),

e^2v  &=& 6 (450)^1/5  (1 - 3(2895 + 209193 )c 2
(805 + 59193 )  r^n + )

e^_1 2   &=&
23  (1 - 15193

e^_2 10    &=& (27 50 )^1/10  (1
-c193  2(15 + 193 ) r^n + ),

where  and  is an arbitrary integration
constant.  The coordinate  is defined by .  We
can use the above as the initial data to obtain a numerical
solution. Plots of the functions  and

Interpolating from AdS to AdS 

      The AdS fixed-point arises for  and
.  The Taylor expansion analysis indicates that the
solution can occur either in the boundary or the horizon of the
AdS.  For a concrete example, we choose , , 
and a negative sign in ().  The boundary solution behaves
as

e^2u  &=& (25 8 )^2/5  y^-2  (1 + c y^n +

e^_2 10    &=& (5 16 )^1/10  (1 -
n+1 2(n-4)  c y^n + ), 
where  or .  The constant  is an arbitrary
integration constant.  Clearly, the flow of this solution from the
boundary leads to a singularity in the bulk.

       As a horizon, AdS has the behavior

e^2u  &=& (64 625 )^1/5  r^2 (1 + c r^n + ),

e^2v  &=& (625 2 )^1/5  (1 -3(15 +

e^_2 10    &=& (5 16 )^1/10  (1 -
15  c 2(3 + 15 )  r^n + ),

where ,  is an integration constant and 
is defined by .  We can use this solution as
our initial data for numerical analysis.  The result is plotted in
Fig. .

study the M-theory dual to a certain six-dimensional theory whose
IR dynamics is given by a ,  superconformal field
theory.

Two-charge membrane in  

          The scalar potential in gauged supergravity with two 
isometries was obtained in.  From this, we deduce
that the relevant Lagrangian involving the two  vector
fields is given by

e^-1 L _6 = R - 12 (_1)^2 -
12 (_2)^2 -
V -14 _i=1 ^2 X_i^-2  (F_^i)^2,

where  with

a_1=(2, 12 ),a_2=(-2, 12 ).

The scalar potential is given by

V=49 g^2 (X_0^2 - 9 X_1 X_2 - 6 X_0 X_1 - 6 X_0 X_2),

where .  As in the previous case, the scalar
potential can be expressed in terms of a superpotential ,
given by

W=g 2 (43 X_0 + 2 X_1 + 2 X_2).


       We consistently reduce the theory on the  or  with
the same metric ansatz as before but specializing to . The
ansatz for the two  field strengths is given by 

. We obtain the  scalar potential

V=12^2 (_i=1 ^2 m_i^2 X_i^-2 )
e^6    -
2 ^2 e^4   +
V e^2  .

It is straightforward to obtain the corresponding superpotential,
given by

W= 2  (_i=1 ^2 m_i X_i^-1  )
e^3   + W e^  .

As in the  case, the constraint  must
be satisfied, implying .  The first-order equations of the
four-dimensional domain-wall has the same form as (), but
with .  Lifting the equations back to  yields

d d  &=& 2(- 22

du d  &=& 1 42  (
 2 (m_1 X_1^-1  + m_2 X_2^-1 )
e^-2v  - W).  

     In the case of , it is consistent to set

section 3.1. After taking  and

by () and (). For general , we do
not find analytical solutions and so it is instructive to study
the system using the numerical approach.

Asymptotic boundary region 

We can express the metric in the form () by making
the coordinate transformation . We have the
boundary conditions  and

e^_1 2   &=& 1 +  (m_1 -
m_2)g 3c^2  y^2 + ,e^_2 8    =
1 +  (m_1 + m_2)g 12c^2  y^2 +
, 
where  is an arbitrary integration constant. As in the case of

the dual operators are not turned on. Next, we examine how these
solutions flow from the above boundary into the bulk.

AdS and AdS 

For , solutions to the equations () with
constant  and  are given by

e ^2 _1 &=&3 2  m_2-m_1 (m_2-m_1)^2+4 9 m_1 m_2   m_2 ,e ^-2 _2 =3 2  cosh (_1 2  ),

e ^-2v  &=& -4g e ^-_2 2    3 (m_1 e ^-_1 2   +m_2 e ^_1 2   ) ,u=-2 3 g e ^-3 8  _2 -2 R_ads   , 
which have the geometry AdS or AdS
for  or , respectively. These solutions were
discussed in detail in and are similar to one
found in. As in the  result, we can define a
charge parameter .  We have  or

When  or , the system has  supersymmetry.
Otherwise, it has  supersymmetry.  Note that the AdS
radius  depends on only  and .

          These solutions have been lifted back to  massive
supergravity in.  The  metric describes a
warped product of Ads with an internal metric composed of an
 bundle over  or .

Interpolating from AdS to AdS 

      As we discussed above, AdS arises for

non-vanishing  and  have been discussed in sections
3 and 4, respectively . We will now consider the general case of

 can occur as an asymptotic geometry in one solution and a
horizon geometry in another.  In order to demonstrate this
explicitly, we take ,  and a positive sign in

asymptotic boundary solution, the Taylor expansions of the metric
components and the scalars go as

e^2u &=& (128 81 )^1/4  y^-2  (1 +

where the coordinate  is defined to be  and
 is an arbitrary integration constant.  The constant  can
take two values:  or .  Clearly, this
solution will flow into a singularity in the bulk.

     On the other hand, for the solution with AdS at
the horizon, we find the Taylor expansion of the next leading
order to be given by

e^2u  &=& (81 128 )^1/4  r^2 (1 + c r^2 + ),

where  and  is an integration
constant. The coordinate  is defined by .
This solution runs smoothly to large distance, where it asymptotes
to the AdS-type solution ().  This can be
demonstrated with numerical calculation, using the above Taylor

are solutions with AdS in the asymptotic boundary as
well as at the near-horizon geometry. For a concrete example, we
choose , ,  and a negative sign in

asymptotic region into a singularity in the bulk.

     In the solution whose near-horizon geometry is AdS

Three-charge string in  

Let us now consider the minimal gauged supergravity in 
coupled to two vector multiplets. The Lagrangian is given by

e^-1 L _5=R - 12 (_1)^2 -12 (_2)^2 - 14_i=1 ^3 X_i^-2  (F_^i)^2 - V +
e^-1  14 ^  F^1_ F^2_  A^3_, 
with the scalar potential

V=-4g^2 _i=1 ^3
         X_i^-1 .
The quantities 
are given by

&&X_i=e^12a_i ,

&&a_1=(2, 2 6 ), a_2=(-2,26 ),a_3=(0,- 46 ).

The scalar potential  in () can be also
expressed in terms of the superpotential , given by

W=2 g _i X_i.


We now reduce the theory on  with the previous metric ansatz
specializing on . The ansatz for the three  2-form
field strengths is given by

F_^i=   m_i ^-2  _12  q_i g^-1  _.

The resulting  scalar potential is

V=12 ^2 (_i m_i^2 X_i^-2 )
e^4   -

,
and the corresponding superpotential is

W= 2 (_im_iX^-1 _i)
e^2   +

Thus, the charge parameters  satisfy . The
first-order equations for the three-dimensional system have the
same form as () but now with

du d  &=& 1 32  (
 2 (m_1 X_1^-1  + m_2 X_2^-1  + m_3
X_3^-1 ) e^-2v  - W).  

For , it is consistent that  and  vanish
and this system reduces to the  system of section 2, with the

 system of section 3.1. After taking

and ().

For , it has recently been found that one can
consistently set , with an exact solution
given by
ds_5^2&=&H^-2/3 [ (g r)^2 (e ^
m 2g^3 r^2  dx_ ^2+H^2 ^-2  d_2^2)+H^2
dr^2 (g r)^2  ],

e ^-6 _2 &=&H, 
where we made the coordinate transformation

d dr =-e ^v (g r)^2 , 
and where

H=1- m 2g^3 r^2 . 

For general , we do not find analytical solutions and so it
is instructive to study the system with a numerical approach.

Asymptotic boundary region 

We can express the metric in the form () by making
the coordinate transformation . The boundary
conditions are  and 
 for small . The leading terms of the Taylor
expansion of the solution of () are given by

e^2u  &=& 1 g^2 y^2  ( 1 +
 (m_1 + m_2+m_3) g 9 c^2  y^2 + ),

e^2v  &=& c^2 g^2 y^2  ( 1 -
7 (m_1+m_2+m_3) g 18c^2  y^2 + ),

e^_1 2   &=& 1 -  (m_1 -
m_2)g 2c^2  y^2 log  y + ,

e^_2 6    &=& 1 -  (m_1 +
m_2-2m_3)g 6c^2  y^2 log  y + , 
where  is an arbitrary integration constant. The
non-normalizable solutions for  and  imply that
the dual operators are turned on, provided that the values of

Next, we examine how these solutions flow from the above boundary
into the bulk.

AdS and AdS 

For , the fixed-point solution is given by

e^2 _1  &=& m_1 m_2 
(m_3+m_2-m_1 m_3 - m_2 + m_1 ),e^6
_2  = m_1m_2(m_3^2 - (m_1-m_2)^2) 
m_3^2(m_1 + m_2 - m_3)^2 ,

e^-2v &=&-g((m_1 + m_2 - m_3)(m_3^2 -
(m_1-m_2)^2) m_1^2m_2^2m_3^2 )^13 ,

u&=& -g e^_2 6   ((_1/2) +
12 e^-32 _2 ) -2 R_ads   .
This solution was discussed in detail in. The reality
condition of the solution implies that when three vectors with the
magnitudes  can form a triangle,  should be the
 metric. On the other hand, when they cannot form a triangle, the
metric should be that of .(AdS solutions
were also recently found in in a different
construction.)   If any of the  vanish, there is no fixed-point
solution, except when one vanishes with the remaining two being equal.
The AdS radius depends on  and two of the three charge
parameters.

Interpolating from AdS to AdS 

As in the previous cases, AdS can occur either as an
asymptotic geometry or on the horizon. In order to demonstrate
this, we take  and . For this choice of charge
parameters, we can set .  For simplicity, we also set
.  As an asymptotic boundary geometry, the Taylor expansions
of the metric components and the scalars are

e^2u &=& 8 2^1/3  25  y^-2  (1 + c y^n + ),

e^2v  &=& 2 2^1/3  (1 -12 cy^n
+),

e^_2 6   &=& 2^1/3  (1 + -116 (11 +317 )
 y^n + ),

where the coordinate  is defined to be  and
 is an arbitrary integration constant.  The constant  can
take two values: .  Clearly, this solution
will flow into a singularity in the bulk.

     On the other hand, for the solution with AdS at
its horizon, we find the Taylor expansion of the next leading
order to be

e^2u  &=& 25 8 2^1/3  r^2 (1 + c r^2 + ),

e^2v  &=& 2 2^1/3  (1 -126 (33 + 1017 ) c r^2

e^_2 6   &=& 2^1/3  (1 + 1 208  (147 -
1117 ) r^2 + ),

where  is an integration constant and  is defined by

for the numerical calculation. The resulting plots are presented
in Fig. ), which show that the solution runs
smoothly from AdS at the horizon to the AdS-type
asymptotic behavior given by ().

Interpolating from AdS to AdS 

      AdS can also occur as an asymptotic geometry
for one solution or as a horizon geometry for another.  As a
concrete example, let us consider  and , for
which case we have .  For simplicity, we set . The
boundary solution behaves as

e^2u  &=& (9 1024 )^1/3  y^-2  (1 + c y^n + ),


e^2v  &=& 6^-1/3  (1 -12 c y^n + ),

e^_2 6   &=& 6^-1/3  (1 + 120  (11 + 319 )
 c y^n + ),

where  and  is an integration constant.
Clearly, the solution will encounter a singularity when it runs away
from this asymptotic region.

      For the solution with AdS at its horizon, the
near-horizon behavior is

e^2u  &=& (1024 9 )^1/3  (1 + c r^n + ),

e^2v  &=& 6^-1/3  (1 -110 (11 + 219 ) c

e^_2 6   &=& 6^-1/3  (1 + 1100 (7 -11

constant. We can use this as the initial conditions for a
numerical calculation and the results are plotted in
Fig. . This shows that the solution runs smoothly
from AdS at the horizon to the AdS-type
asymptotic geometry given by ().

Four-charge black hole in  

Let us now consider the  gauged  supergravity in four
dimensions. The Lagrangian is given by

e^-1 L _4=R - 12 (_1)^2 -12 (_2)^2 -12 (_3)^2 14_i=1 ^4 X_i^-2  (F_^i)^2 - V , 
with the scalar potential

V=-4g^2 _i<j  X_i X_j.  
The quantities  are given by

&&X_i=e^12a_i ,

&&a_1=(1, 1, 1),a_2=(1, -1, -1),a_3=(-1, 1, -1),a_4=(-1, -1, 1). 
The scalar potential  in () can be also expressed
in terms of the superpotential , where

W=2 g _i=1 ^4 X_i. 
We use the metric ansatz () and take the four
 2-form field strengths to be

F_^i= m_i ^-2  _
12q_ig^-1  _. 
A solution will be supersymmetric provided that the following
constraint is satisfied:

^2=g_i m_i, 
and hence .  The equations of motion are
given by

d d  &=&
2(- 22  _i=1 ^4 m_i a_i X_i^-1  e^-2v  +
dW d ),

dv d  &=& -1 22 
( 2  
_i=1 ^4 m_i X_i^-1  e^-2v  + W),

du d  &=& 1 22  (
 2  _i=1 ^4 m_i X_i^-1  e^-2v  -
W).  

For , it is consistent that  and 
vanish and this system reduces to the  system of section 2,
with the solution given by (). For
general , we do not find analytical solutions and it is
instructive to study the system using the numerical approach.

Asymptotic boundary region 

We can express the metric in the form () by making
the coordinate transformation . We have the
boundary conditions  and 
 for small . The leading terms of the Taylor
expansion of the solution of () are given by

e^2u  &=& 1 4g^2 y^2  ( 1 +
 _i=1 ^4 m_i g 3 c^2  y^2 + ),

e^2v  &=& c^2 4g^2 y^2  ( 1 -
2 _i=1 ^4 m_i g 3c^2  y^2 + ),

e^1 2    &=& 1 -  _i=1 ^4
a _i m_ig 2c^2  y^2 + , 
where  is an arbitrary integration constant. As in the cases of
 and , the normalizable solutions for  and
 imply that the dual operators are not turned on. Next, we
examine how these solutions flow from the above boundary into the
bulk.

AdS and AdS 

For , we have not obtained the general solution
for arbitrary . However, a class of special solutions results
from setting .  This enables one to
consistently set . For this
truncation, fixed-point solutions for  are given
by

e ^2   &=& 3m_2-m_1(m_1-m_2)(m_1-9m_2)  2m_2 ,e ^-2v = 4g
 sinh   m_1 e ^-2 -m_2 ,

u&=& 12g( 2(m_1 e ^-3 2  +3m_2
e ^1 2  ) m_2-m_1 e ^-2   sinh  +e ^3 2  +3e ^-1 2  ) 2 R_ads   . 
This solution was discussed in detail in
. The reality condition of the solution implies that for
, corresponding to , we must have either  and
 or  and . For ,
corresponding to , we must have  and .  In
general, the AdS radius depends on  and three of the four
charge parameters.

Interpolating from AdS to AdS 

As in the previous cases, AdS can occur at the
asymptotic boundary of one solution and the horizon geometry of
another.  This can be demonstrated using Taylor expansion. For a
concrete example, let us consider  and .  As
shown in the previous subsection, we have .  Near the
asymptotic boundary, the solution behaves as

e^2u = 2 25 y^-2  (1 + c y^2/5  +
),e^2v =2 (1 + ),e^12 
= 2^1/4  (1-76 c y^2/5  + ). 
Clearly this solution will run into a singularity in the bulk.

     On the other hand, for the solution with the AdS
horizon, the near-horizon behavior is given by

e^2u =25 2  r^2 (1 + c r + ),e^2v = 2 (1 -35 19 c r+ ),e^12  = 2^1/4  (1 + 5 38  c r
+),

where  is an integration constant.  Using this as initial data
for numerical calculation, we plot the result in
Fig. . Thus, we see that the solution runs from
AdS at the horizon to the AdS-like geometry
() in the asymptotic region.

   , , , and .  

Interpolating from AdS to AdS 

      Analogously, AdS can also either occur at the
horizon region of a solution and at the asymptotic region of
another. As an example, let us consider  and
, which implies that .  For the
solution with AdS in its asymptotic region, the
behavior can be studied using Taylor expansion:

e^2u =7 100  (1 + c r^6/5  + ),e^2v =7 4  (1 + ),e^12 =7^1/4  (1 - 11 18  c r^6/5  +
),

where  is an arbitrary integration constant.  Clearly, the flow
of this solution from the boundary leads to a singularity in the
bulk.

      For the solution with AdS at its horizon,
the near-horizon behavior is given by

e^2u =100 7  r^2 (1 + c r + ),e^2v =7 4  (1 -55 41  c r + ),e^12  =7^1/4  (1 +15 82  c r +),

where  is an integration constant.  Using this as initial data, we
perform numerical calculation.  The plots are presented in
Fig. .  From the plots, we see that the solution runs
smoothly from the AdS horizon to the AdS-like
asymptotic region given in ().

String and M-theory origins 

          Gauged supergravities in  and  can be obtained
from consistent sphere reductions of M-theory, type IIB or massive
type IIA supergravities.  Thus, it is straightforward to lift our
solutions back to higher dimensions and study their properties.  A
particularly interesting class of solutions which we obtained are
those that smoothly interpolate between AdS
at the horizon and AdS-type spacetime in the asymptotic
region. When lifted to higher dimensions, the asymptotic region
becomes a direct product of AdS with a relevant sphere
(Except in the case of massive type IIA supergravity, for
which the AdS embedding involves a singular warp factor
.) .  On the other hand, the horizon region becomes a
warped product of AdS with an internal metric that is an 
bundle over  for  and 7.  We shall look at these cases in
detail.  Some of the results have been reported in a recent letter
.


 solutions embedded in M-theory 

      It is straightforward to lift the AdS and
AdS solutions given by () to  by
using the ansatz obtained in.  Since the
solutions for general  are rather complicated to present, we
only consider a representative example of AdS with
 and .  The M-theory metric is given by

ds_11 ^2 &=& ^13 [ds_AdS_5  ^2 +
1 g^2 c   1 4c 
(d^2 + ^2 d^2)

&&+ 1  (14 d_0^2 +
15(d_1^2 + _1^2
(d_1 -52  d)^2)

&& + d_2^2 + _2^2 (d_2 + 32 d)^2
) ], 
where  and  are spherical coordinates which
satisfy . The warp factor ,
which is not to be confused with the dilaton coupling parameter in
section 3, is given by

(4_0^2 + 5 _1^2 + _2^2)>0. 
The AdS metric is given by

ds_AdS_5  ^2 = e^-2 R   dx^ dx_+
d^2, 
where the AdS radius is . Note that, for all
lifted solutions,  is defined as in sections 4-7.

The case of  provides an example of AdS
which is easily embedded in M-theory. The corresponding
eleven-dimensional metric is given by

ds_11 ^2 &=& ^13 [ds_AdS_5  ^2 +
(34)^3/5  1 g^2   d^2 + ^2
d^2 +d_1^2
 & & + (34)^-4/5  1  
cos ^2 _1 ( d_2^2+cos ^2 _2
(d_1- 12 cosh   d)^2
 & & +sin ^2 _2 (d_2-12 cosh   d)^2
)  ]. 
The warp factor  is given by

-4/5 sin ^2 _1+(34)^1/5 cos ^2 _1 >0, 
and the AdS radius is .

     In the above geometries, the internal space of the  metric
can be viewed as an  bundle over  or , with two
diagonal  bundles (Supersymmetric AdS solutions of
M-theory with internal spaces which can be viewed as  bundles
over various spaces have also been discussed in
.) . In general, the
internal metric can be labelled by the two diagonal monopole
charges .
In the specific example of AdS above,
 and the solution is smooth everywhere. For
general , the metric does not have a power-law
singularity. However, it could have a conical orbifold
singularity, which is absent only if  are integers.
Since  satisfy the constraint , it follows that
they are either both even or both odd integers. In the even case,
the bundle is topologically trivial, whilst it is twisted for the
odd case. The internal space can be regarded as having a
generalized holonomy group, since it is not Ricci
flat and involves a form field.

     The solution preserves  supersymmetry; it is a
supergravity dual to an ,  superconformal field
theory on the boundary of AdS. This provides a concrete framework
to study AdS/CFT from the point of view of M-theory.

     The seven-dimensional single-charge 3-brane given by
() and () can also be lifted to M-theory.  The
corresponding eleven-dimensional metric is given by

ds_11 ^2= ^1/3  ds_7^2+1 g^2 ^2/3  
[ H^-1/5   d^2+H^2/5  cos ^2 
d _2^2+H^-3/5  sin ^2  (d_1+A_)^2
], 
where

3/5 sin ^2 +H^-2/5 cos ^2 >0
, dA_=_.  solutions embedded in massive IIA theory 

         Using the reduction ansatz in, it is
straightforward to lift the AdS and AdS
 solutions given by () up to  massive
IIA supergravity. The metric is given by

ds_10 ^2 &=& _0^112   X_0^18  (X1
X_2)^14  ^38  [ds_6^2 + g^-2 
^-1 
(X_0^-1  d_0^2

&&+X_1^-1  (d_1^2 + _1^2(d_1 + gA_^2)^2) +
X_2^-1  (d_2^2 + _2^2(d_2 +
gA_^1)^2))] ,
where  and 
.  Thus, the  metric is a warped
product of AdS with an internal six-metric, which is an 
bundle over  or , depending on the charge parameter 
according to the rule ().

    As an example of a supersymmetric, though singular,
compactification of AdS from massive IIA theory, we can take
,  and a negative sign in ().  This
gives ,  and , where 
. Also, ,
 and the radius of
AdS is given by . On the other hand, 
provides an embedding of AdS in massive IIA theory.

The six-dimensional single-charge membrane given by
() and () can also be lifted to massive IIA
theory. The corresponding ten-dimensional metric is given by






H^3/8  cos ^2  d _2^2+H^-5/8  sin ^2  (d_1+A_)^2 ] ), 
where

5/8 sin ^2 +H^-3/8 cos ^2 >0
,dA_=_. 
Note that the overall warping factor depends on two internal
coordinates.

 solutions embedded in IIB theory 

        The AdS and AdS solutions given by
() can be lifted to ten-dimensional IIB theory
with the reduction ansatz obtained in.  Since
the solution with general  is complicated to present, we
consider a simpler case with . The ten-dimensional metric
is

ds_10 ^2&=&   ds_AdS_3  ^2
+g^-2 
(m_1 m_3-2m_1 )^1/3  (12 q_1 d_2^2 + d^2)

&&+ g^-2 ^-1 [ c^-1/3  ^2(d^2 + ^2 (d_1 + 12 q_1 A_)^2

&& +^2 (d_2 + 12 q_1 A_)^2) +

A_)^2], 
where

&&c=m_1 2m_1-m_3 ,1/3

&&ds_AdS_3  ^2 = e^-2 R   (-dt^2 + dx^2) +
d^2, R=2m_1 g(4m_1-m_3) c^1/3  
. 
We have introduced the charge parameters 
, and hence they satisfy the constraint .
In the above solution, if , we should have
, corresponding to ; if , we
should have , corresponding to .  In general, the
internal metric is an  bundle over  or , depending
the values of the  according to the above rules.

It is especially simple to lift the five-dimensional
equal-three-charge string given by (), due to the
absence of scalars. The corresponding ten-dimensional metric is
given by





+cos ^2 (d_2+1 3 A_)^2 )+sin ^2 (d_3+1 3 A_)^2 ], 
where .

For the five-dimensional three-equal-charged string with a
nontrivial dilaton, given by (), the corresponding
ten-dimensional metric is






H^-1/3 cos ^2 ( d^2+sin ^2 (d_2+1 3  A_)^2+cos ^2 (d_3+1 3 
A_)^2 ) ], 
where

1/3 cos ^2 +H^-2/3 sin ^2 >0
, dA_=_.  

For five-dimensional single-charge string given by ()
and (), the corresponding metric is

ds_10 ^2= ds_5^2+1 g^2   
[ H^1/3   d^2+H^-1/3 cos ^2 
d_3^2 +H^2/3 sin ^2 (d_3+A_)^2 ], 
where  and  are given by ().

 solutions embedded in M-theory 

        We use the reduction ansatz obtained in to
lift the AdS and AdS solutions given
by () back to , with the metric

ds_11 ^2 &=& ^2/3  ds_AdS_2  ^2
+e ^2v  (m_1+3m_2)g d_2^2

R &=& 2 g  [ 2(m_1 e ^-3 2  +3m_2 e ^1 2  ) m_2-m_1
e ^-2   sinh  +e ^3 2  +3e ^-1 2  ]^-1 . 
In general, the nine-dimensional internal metric is an 
bundle over  or , depending the values of the .
This is an especially interesting example of a space with
generalized holonomy group, since nine-dimensional Ricci-flat
manifolds do not have an irreducible special holonomy group.

The four-dimensional single-charge black hole given by
() and () can also be embedded in
M-theory, with the corresponding eleven-dimensional metric










H^-1/2 cos ^2  cos ^2

Conclusions 

      We have investigated a large class of supersymmetric
magnetic brane solutions supported by  gauge fields in
gauged supergravities of dimensions .  We have
obtained first-order equations by using a superpotential approach.
These equations admit stationary AdS
solutions, where  can be  or  depending on the
values of the -charges.  The -charges  satisfy
the condition

q_1 + q_2 + + q_n=2.

For  and , a maximum of two  charges are allowed and the
rule for having  or  can be clearly summarized by
().  For  and , the maximum number of charges
can be 3 and 4, respectively, and the complete rule remains to be
specified, although we have obtained explicit examples of  and
.  Such constraints show that magnetic branes in AdS gauged
supergravity are rather different from those in ungauged
supergravities since, for the latter case, charges are unconstrained
integration constants.  The radius of AdS depends on the
-dimensional cosmological constant and  charge parameters.

       The fraction of supersymmetry preserved by our brane solutions
is the same as for those in ungauged supergravities, and depends on
the number of  field strengths involved. Embedded in maximal
supersymmetric theories, the preserved fraction of the supersymmetry
is , for , 2, or 3 field strengths. In the case of ,
the introduction of the fourth field strength does not break further
supersymmetry and hence the preserved fraction is .

      Our first-order equations support two types of solutions that
run from the aforementioned stationary ones. The first type has a
geometry which approaches AdS in the
asymptotic region and the solution runs into a singularity at
small distance. The second type, which is more interesting, has a
near-horizon geometry of AdS and smoothly
runs to an AdS-type geometry () in the asymptotic
region. The non-constant scalar fields are bounded. This implies
the existence of a large class of conformal field theories in
diverse dimensions whose renormalization group flows from the UV
conformal fixed point to the IR conformal fixed point. The fact
that, from the same set of equations, AdS
arises as the horizon geometry in one type of solution and the
asymptotic geometry in another, suggests that the stationary
solution lies at the inflection point of the modulus space.  Thus,
a phase transition can occur, determining whether the system runs
into a singularity or an AdS-type metric.

     The asymptotic AdS-type geometry of the second type of
solution has a boundary of Minkowski. The case
of  arises as a vacuum solution of a six-dimensional gauged
supergravity constructed in.  This vacuum solution is
of particular interest since the  Yang-Mills field can be
obtained from the internal  without introducing a non-vanishing
cosmological constant.  Similar possibilities have also been observed
for  and brane-world Kaluza-Klein reduction of string theory
. However, unlike these present solutions, the
reduction discussed in is non-supersymmetric and
singular. Of course, the asymptotic AdS-type geometry
() is not an exact solution everywhere, since it runs to
AdS in the bulk.  We do not expect that there exists a
consistent Kaluza-Klein reduction of  gauged supergravity to the
 theory of. Rather, the latter theory should be
viewed as the effective theory only at the boundary of our
solutions. Since there are also solutions that smoothly run from
AdS to an AdS-type geometry with the boundary
Minkowski, we expect that there exists an effective
gauged supergravity theory in  that admits such a vacuum
solution.
