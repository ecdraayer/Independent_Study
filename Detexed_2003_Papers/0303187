Inspired by factorized scattering from delta-type impurities in
(1+1)-dimensional space-time, we propose and analyse a generalization
of the Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra. Distinguished elements of the
new algebra, called reflection and transmission generators, encode the
particle-impurity interactions. We describe in detail the underlying
algebraic structure. The relative Fock representations are
explicitly constructed and a general factorized scattering theory
is developed in this framework.

Introduction 

Much progress has been made in the last two decades in understanding
the physical
properties and the mathematical structure of integrable quantum
systems in 1+1 dimensions.
The idea of factorized scattering, which can be traced back to the
pioneering work of
Yang, plays a central role in most of the
significant developments
in this field. It has been recognized later, that
the algebraic structure in the basis of factorized scattering theory is the
Zamolodchikov-Faddeev (ZF) algebra
-. This algebra
represents a powerful tool for deriving not only -matrix
amplitudes, but also form-factors
of local operators.

Integrable models with boundaries-or defects- have recently
also been the subject of intense
study. Since factorized scattering turns out to be fundamental in
this context as well,
the natural problem that arises is to find the counterpart of the ZF algebra,
which works
in the presence of reflecting and transmitting impurities. The main goal of
the present paper is to introduce such an algebra, called in what follows
reflection-transmission  (RT) algebra. Our strategy is to generalize the
approach to integrable systems on the half-line developed in
.
Besides the particle creation and annihilation
operators, the RT algebra involves also reflection and transmission
(defect) generators.
In the Fock representation, the latter acquire  non-vanishing vacuum
expectation values, defined in terms of
the observable reflection and transmission amplitudes of a single
particle interacting
with the defect. Together with the two-body bulk scattering matrix,
these amplitudes form the physical input. The structure of
the RT algebra is inspired by some exactly
solvable integrable models with -type impurities.
Apart from providing a useful test for the general setup, these systems find
concrete applications in
conductance problems.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we focus on quantum
inverse scattering with -impurities. The general concept of RT algebra
is introduced in section 3. After a brief description of the basic
features of these
algebras, we construct the relative Fock representations. Section 4
is devoted to
scattering with impurities. We first establish the unitarity and factorization
constraints. Using the Fock representation of a suitable RT algebra, we define
afterwards the "in"-coming and "out"-going states and construct
the total scattering operator. The last
section contains our conclusions. We discuss there some universal features
of the RT algebras and their relevance to inverse scattering and
other related topics.


Origin of reflection-transmission algebras 


It is instructive to start the discussion with two examples, showing how the
RT algebras emerge from the study of quantum impurity problems.
We begin with the -particle Hamiltonian
H^(n)  = _i=1 ^n - 1 2  _x_i ^2 +  (x_i)  ,
 ,
which describes a system of  non-relativistic bosonic particles (of
unit mass) on , which
interact with a -type impurity localized in the origin, but
not among themselves.
This model is well-known to be exactly solvable. It is sufficient to
investigate
the spectral problem associated with the one-particle Hamiltonian ,
defined on a suitable (see e.g.) domain 

of continuous functions on , which are twice differentiable in
 and
satisfy
_x0 [(_x )(x) - (_x )(-x) ] =
2 (0)  .
 is self-adjoint on .
A set of orthogonal (generalized) eigenstates
, verifying (), is
_k^(x) = (k) (x) T(k) ^ikx  +
(x)[^ikx  + R(k)^-ikx ]  ,
where  denotes the standard Heaviside function and
T(k) = k k + i   , R(k) = -i k + i   .
The family ,
where the bar stands for complex conjugation, is also
orthonormal. The systems  and
 represent
physically scattering
states and, for , are separately complete in .
When , there is in addition one bound state
_b (x) = (-)  [(x) ^x  +
(-x) ^-x ] ,
which is orthogonal to  and
.
The energy of  is .

Particle collision and production processes are absent from this simple model.
Nevertheless, the reflection and transmission from the impurity give rise to a
non-trivial scattering operator, which preserves the particle number and
can be described as follows. Using the weak  limits
_x  ^ikx   k+i  = 0  ,
> 0 ,
one can verify that
_x  [_k^(x) - ^ikx ] = 0 .
Therefore, one can interpret 
asymptotically as incoming waves, travelling in 
with momentum  towards the impurity. Accordingly, we take the vectors
k^in  = _k^+ (x) + _k^- (x)  ,
to be the basis of one-particle "in"  states. Analogous considerations
lead us to choose the following basis of one-particle "out"  states:
k^out   =  _-k ^ +  (x) +
 _-k ^ -  (x)  .
The one-particle scattering operator is defined at this point by
^(1) 
k^out  = k^in   .
By construction,  is a unitary operator on
 for . In the range ,
 is defined and
unitary on the orthogonal complement to the bound state () in
.
The one-particle transition amplitude reads
& ^out pk^in  =
 ^out p^(1) k^out  = 

&[(p) T(p) + (-p) T(-p)]2(p-k) + 

&[(p) R(p) + (-p) R(-p)]2(p+k)  ,
which clarifies the physical meaning of  and , given by eq. ().
They represent the transmission and reflection amplitudes and admit a
meromorphic continuation
in  to the whole complex plane . The pole  confirms
the presence of
the bound state  for  and indicates the existence of a
resonance state for .
 
The -particle amplitude, with initial and final configurations satisfying
 and  respectively, can be expressed in
terms of ()
as follows:
 ^out p_1,...,p_nk_1,...,k_n^in  =
 ^out p_1,...,p_n^(n) k_1,...,k_n^out  =
_i=1 ^n  ^out p_ik_i^in   .
Equation () concludes our brief summary of the standard
and well-known
analytic treatment of the integrable system defined by ().

A natural question one may ask at this point concerns the existence of an
algebraic framework for dealing with the above system for ,
similar to the familiar canonical commutation approach, which works in the case
. The answer to this question turns out to be
affirmative and we now turn to the description of the relevant
algebraic structure. Following
our previous work, we introduce the associative
algebra   with identity element , generated by

obeying the bosonic-type commutation relations:
&a__1 (k_1) a__2 (k_2) -  a__2 (k_2) a__1 (k_1) = 0 ,
 

&a^_1 (k_1) a^_2 (k_2) - a^_2 (k_2)
a^_1 (k_1) = 0 ,
 

&a__1 (k_1) a^_2 (k_2) - a^_2 (k_2)
a__1 (k_1) = 

&[__1 ^_2  + __1 ^_2 (k_1)] 2(k_1-k_2) 1  +
__1 ^_2 (k_1) 2(k_1+k_2) 1  ,
where
(k) =( ) ,
(k) =( ) .
The right-hand side of eq. () captures the presence of the impurity.
The term proportional to  reflects in particular the
breaking of translation and Galilean invariance due to the impurity.
We shall see
in the next section that  is a particular RT algebra. For
the moment we focus on the Fock
representation  of , referring for the explicit
construction to sect. 3.2.
An essential feature of  is that the operators 
 in
this representation satisfy
a_(k) &=& _^(k) a_(k) + _^(k) a_(-k)  ,
 

a^ (k) &=& a^ (k) _^(k) +
a^ (-k) _^(-k)  .
Hereafter the summation over repeated upper and lower indices is understood.
The relations (), () originate from
the reflection-transmission automorphism characterizing any
RT algebra and established in sect. 3.
In the physical context these relations encode the interaction with
the impurity.

The vacuum state  obeys as usual . We
denote by  the scalar product in 
and consider the vacuum expectation value
(a^_1 (p_1)...a^_n (p_n) ,  a^_1 (k_1)...a^_n (k_n))  ,
with
k_1<<k_n ,_i = -(k_i) ,
p_1>>p_n ,_i = (p_i)  ,
 being the sign function. By means of eqs. ()-()
it is easily verified that () precisely reproduce
the amplitudes () for any . Therefore,  provides a purely
algebraic framework for constructing the scattering operator. The
formalism actually applies
to any observable of the system, introducing in addition to 
the creation and annihilation operators  for
the bound state (), which commute with 
  and satisfy
[b , b] = [b^ , b^] = 0 , [b , b^] = 1  .
 For the Hamiltonian one finds, for instance,
H = 1 2  _- ^+  dk 2 k^2 a^ (k) a_(k) -
(-)^2 2 b^b  .
The restriction of  to the -particle subspace of the total
Hilbert space (including
the bound state) is the algebraic counterpart of the Hamiltonian
() we started with.

At this stage we have enough background to turn to quantum field
theory with -type impurities
.
Our goal will be to demonstrate that the algebra  can
be successfully applied there as well. As an example we consider the model
&S[] = 1 2  _- ^+  dt
_- ^+ dx
[(_t)^2(t,x) - (_x)^2(t,x) 

&- m^2 ^2 (t,x) - 2(x) ^2 (t,x)]  ,
with  and . The action () defines a standard
external field problem with -potential. The corresponding
equation of motion is
[_t^2 - _x^2 + m^2 + 2(x)] (t,x) = 0 ,
and our problem will now be to quantize () with the standard
initial conditions:
[(0,x_1) , (0,x_2)] = 0 , [(_t)(0,x_1) , (0,x_2)] = -i(x_1-x_2)  .
The solution of this problem requires the study of the operator
K -_x^2 + m^2 +2(x)  .
We already know that  is self-adjoint on . In order to
avoid imaginary energies,
we demand  to be non-negative, which implies
-m  .
Now, the solution of eqs. () and ()
is unique and can be expressed in terms of the generators
 and .
One finds
(t,x) = _+ (t,x) + _- (t,x) + _b  (t,x)  ,
where
_(t,x) = _- ^+  dk 22(k)  
[a^ (k)  _k^   (x)^i(k)t  +
a_(k) _k^(x)^-i(k)t ]  ,
_b  (t,x) = 1 2(i)  
[b^ ^it(i)  +
b ^-it(i) ] _b  (x) ,
with .

Using eqs. () and ()-(), one easily derives
the two-point vacuum expectation value
&&w^(2) (t_1,x_1,t_2,x_n) =
((t_1,x_1) , (t_2,x_2)) = 

&&_- ^+  dk 4(k)  ^-i(k)t_12  
(x_1)(-x_2) T(k)^ikx_12   +
(-x_1)(x_2) T (k)^ikx_12   + 

&&(x_1)(x_2)
[^ikx_12   + R(k)^ikx _12  ] +
(-x_1)(-x_2)
[^ikx_12   + R (k)^ikx _12  ]  + 

&&1 2(i) ^-it_12 (i)  _b (x_1)  _b (x_2)  ,
where ,  and 
.
The last term in () represents the contribution of the bound
state and vanishes for
. The field  has a relativistic dispersion relation
, but nevertheless Lorentz invariance is
manifestly broken in ().

The function () fully determines the theory. In fact ,
whereas  can be derived from  by means of the
well-known recursion relation
&w^(2n) (t_1,x_1,...,t_2n ,x_2n ) = 

&_i=1 ^2n-1  w^(2) (t_i,x_i,t_2n ,x_2n )
w^(2n-2) (t_1,x_1,...,t _i,x _i,...,t_2n-1 ,x_2n-1 )  , the hat indicating that the corresponding argument must be omitted.

Having at our disposal all
correlation functions, we can derive the scattering operator of the theory.
The particles of our model do not interact directly, but interact with the
external -function field, modelling the impurity. We will now show that
the associated scattering matrix is fully determined by
the algebra . Equation () therefore represents a true
quantum inverse scattering
transform, allowing a reconstruction of the fields  from
.
Let us concentrate first on the case , commenting at the end
on the range
. In developing the scattering theory one can use the
Haag-Ruelle approachwith some minor modifications, which reflect
the absence of translation invariance.
The novel feature, with respect to the quantum mechanical example
discussed above, is
that in quantum field theory we need smearing with special
wave-packets for the free Klein-Gordon
equation, which keep trace of the position  of the impurity.
Such wave-packets
can be introduced as follows. Let  be the space of smooth
test functions
with compact support. Then
f^t (x) = _- ^+  dk 22(k)   f(k) ^ikx-i(k)t   ,
f() ,
is a smooth solution of the Klein-Gordon equation of mass . We
will say that
 precedes  and write 
if and only if
 and  for all
 and all. We now introduce
   the two sets
 and 
,
which satisfy the non-overlapping conditions
g_1 g_m  , &h_n h_1  , 

0g_i  ,     &0h_j  .
Setting now
_i =
   . _j =
   .
we define
g^t__i (x) = (_i x) g_i^ t  (x)  , h^t__j (x) = (_j x) h_j^ t  (x)  .
By construction,  represent wave-packets in
 which move towards the impurity in . On the other hand,
 are wave-packets in , which travel
away from the impurity in the direction . Therefore
one expects that the smeared operators
(t, g__i ^t) = i _- ^+  dx
[(_t g__i ^t) (x) (t,x) -
g__i ^t(x) (_t ) (t,x) ]  ,
(t, h__j ^t) = i _- ^+  dx
[(_t h__j ^t) (x) (t,x) -
h__j ^t(x) (_t ) (t,x)]
generate asymptotic "in" and "out"  states respectively. This is
indeed the case because
of the existence of the following strong limits in the Fock space :
_t-  (t, g__1 ^t) (t,
g__m ^t) =
a^_1 (g_1) a^_m (g_m) g_1,...,g_m ^in  ,  

_t+  (t, h__1 ^t) (t,
h__n ^t) =
a^_1 (h_1) a^_n (h_n) h_1,...,h_n ^out  ,
where
a^ (f) = _- ^+  dk 2  f(k)
a^ (k)  .
Let us sketch the proof of (), for example. Using the
non-overlapping conditions
(), the commutation relations
()-() and the
constraints (), (), one first derives the identity
(t, g__1 ^t ) (t, g__m ^t) =
a^_1 (g __1 ^t) a^_m (g __m ^t)  ,
where
g __i ^t (p) = _- ^  dx (_i x)
_- ^  dk 2 
 (k) + (p) 2(k) (p)   g_i(k)
 ^i[(p)-(k)]t - ix(p-k)   .
Therefore, eq. () is equivalent to
_t- 
a^_1 (g __1 ^t) a^_m (g __m ^t) - a^_1 (g_1) a^_m (g_m) = 0  ,
 being the -norm. For proving
() one uses the continuity
of  in  (see the estimate () below) and
_t-  g __i ^t - g_i= 0  ,
   i = 1,...,m  .
 Finally, () is a consequence of the weak limits (),
    being replaced by . This concludes the argument.

Summarizing, the finite linear combinations of the vectors
&g_1,...,g_m ^in  : g_1 g_m 
, m=1,2,...  , 

&h_1,...,h_n ^out  : h_n h_1 
, n=1,2,...
generate, after completion with respect to the scalar product in the
Fock space ,
the asymptotic spaces  and . It turns out that
asymptotic completeness 
holds for .
The transition amplitudes read
 ^out h_1,...,h_n g_1,...,g_m ^in  = _mn 
_i=1 ^n _- ^+  dp_i 2  dk_i 2 
h _i(p_i) ^out p_ik_i^in  
g_i(k_i) ,
where  is given by ().
These results can be generalized to the case , except for
the property of asymptotic completeness, which is violated by the bound
state present in this range.

It is worth mentioning that the above framework applies with
straightforward modifications to fermionic systems
as well. The relevant algebra  is obtained in this case simply
by replacing
the commutators in the right-hand sides of eqs. ()-() with
anticommutators.

It is evident from the above considerations that  is a universal
and powerful tool for
handling -type impurities, both in quantum mechanics and
quantum field theory.
One can view  () as a central extension of the algebra of canonical
commutation (anticommutation) relations. A direct generalization,
emerging at this point,
is to substitute  and  in eq.
() with new generators
 and , which are no longer central elements. Moreover,
in the spirit of the ZF algebra, it is possible to
replace the bosonic (fermionic) exchange factor between 

with a more general one. In this way one naturally arrives at the
general concept
of RT algebra, described in the next section.

Reflection-transmission algebras 

 Definition and general properties 

Inspired by the above treatment of -impurities, we introduce
an associative algebra with identity element  and two
types of generators,  and
,
called bulk and defect (reflection and transmission)
generators, respectively. We refer to  as a
spectral parameter. In the context of inverse scattering 
parametrizes the particle
dispersion relation (see eqs. () below). To be able to deal
with systems with
internal degrees of freedom, we adopt double indices 
. The component
 indicates the half-line  where the particle is
created or annihilated,
whereas  parametrizes the internal ("isotopic") degrees
of freedom. The generators


are subject to the following constraints:
 
  bulk exchange relations
a__1 (_1)   a__2  (_2)   -  
        __2 _1  ^_1 _2  
        (_2 , _1) a__2  (_2) a__1

         , 

a^_1  (_1) a^_2   (_2) -
        a^_2   (_2) a^_1   (_1)
        __2 _1  ^_1 _2  (_2 , _1) & = & 0
         ,  

a__1  (_1) a^_2   (_2)  - 
        a^_2  (_2)
        __1 _2  ^_2 _1  (_1 , _2)
        a__1  (_1) & = &

        [__1  ^_2   1  +
t__1 ^_2 (_1)] +
        2 (_1 + _2)  r__1  ^_2  (_1)
         ;
  defect exchange relations

r__1 ^_1 (_1)
__2 _1 ^_1 _2 (_2 , -_1)
r__2 ^_2 (_2) = 

r__2 ^_2 (_2)
__1_2 ^_2 _1 (_1 , -_2)
r^_1 __1 (_1)
__2_1 ^_1 _2 (-_2 , -_1)
 ; __1 _2 ^_2 _1 (_1 , _2)
t__1 ^_1 (_1)
__2 _1 ^_1 _2 (_2 , _1)
t__2 ^_2 (_2) = 

t__2 ^_2 (_2)
__1_2 ^_2 _1 (_1 , _2)

__2_1 ^_1 _2 (_2 , _1)
 ; __1 _2 ^_2 _1 (_1 , _2)

r__2 ^_2 (_2)
__1_2 ^_2 _1 (_1 , -_2)
t^_1 __1 (_1)
__2_1 ^_1 _2 (-_2 , _1)
 ;   mixed exchange relations
a__1 (_1) r__2 ^_2 (_2) =
__2 _1 ^_1_2 (_2 , _1)
r__2 ^_2 (_2)
__1 _2 ^_2 _1 (_1 , -_2)
a__1 (_1)
 , r__1 ^_1 (_1) a^_2 (_2) =

a^_2 (_2)
__1 _2 ^_2 _1 (_1 , _2)
t__1 ^_1 (_1)
__2_1 ^_1 _2 (_2 , _1)
 . The exchange factor  is required to satisfy some compatibility
conditions, which read as follows, in conventional tensor notation:
_12  (_1,_2) _12 (_2,_1) =  ,
_12 (_1,_2) _23 (_1,_3) _12  (_2,_3)
= _23 (_2,_3) _12 (_1,_3) _23 (_1,_2)   .
Equation () is know as the "unitarity" condition, whereas
() is the celebrated quantum Yang-Baxter equation in its braid form,
 playing the role of spectral set. We emphasize that 
depends in general
on  and  separately, which allows
 to treat systems with broken Lorentz (Galilean)
invariance -
an expected feature when defects are present.

Recapitulating, with any solution  of (), () we
associate an associative algebra , whose generators


satisfy the constraints ()-(). The bulk exchange
relations ()-()
are similar to those of the ZF algebra, but for the
presence of the defect generators in the right-hand side of ().
The exchange properties of the latter are described by eqs.
()-().
Equation () looks similar to
the boundary Yang-Baxter equation, the difference
being that
in general the elements  do not commute
and, consequently, their position in () is essential.
Notice that 
close a subalgebra of , which generalizes the Sklyanin algebra
 for the pure reflection case ().
The mixed relations ()-() complete the list,
fixing the exchange properties between bulk and defect generators.

Two particular cases of  were previously investigated.
Setting  one gets the boundary algebra
introduced in for handling integrable
systems on the half-line . For
 one obtains instead
the ZF algebra, which applies to the same systems, but on the whole line
. In this respect  emerges as a unifying algebraic structure for
quantum field inverse scattering in 1+1 dimensions, which
works also in the presence of impurities. This expectation is widely
confirmed by the results reported in sect. 4.

In this paper we focus on RT algebras.
A RT algebra is a -algebra whose defect generators satisfy in addition
t__1 ^() t^_2 _() +
r__1 ^() r^_2 _(-) =
__1 ^_2   ,
t__1 ^() r^_2 _() +
r__1 ^() t^_2 _(-) = 0  .
A characteristic feature of any RT
algebra is a peculiar automorphism, which implements in algebraic
terms the physical
concepts of transmission and reflection and which is established a few
lines below.

 For constructing the Fock representation of , one needs
an involution. The most natural one is obtained by extending the mapping
I  :   a^ ()  a_() , I  :   a_()  a^ ()  ,
I  :   r_^() r_^(-)
,   
I  :   t_^() t_^() ,
as an antilinear antihomomorphism on . In fact, it is not
difficult to check that
 leaves ()-() invariant, provided that
_12 ^(_1,_2) = _12 (_2,_1) ,
where the dagger stands for the Hermitian conjugation. The condition
(),
known as Hermitian analyticity of ,
is assumed in what follows.

Let us finally consider the mapping
 :  a_() t_^() a_() +
r_^() a_(-) ,
 :  a^  () a^  ()
t^_() +
a^  (-) r^_(-)  ,
 :   r_^() r^_() ,   :   t_^() t^_() .
One can directly verify that  leaves
()-() invariant as well therefore
and extends  to an automorphism on , considered as an
algebra with involution .
We refer to  as reflection-transmission automorphism and
remark that because of
() and (),  is idempotent. Equations
() and ()
are the algebraic counterparts of () and (). They have
a simple physical interpretation:
each particle in the bulk is -equivalent to a superposition
of a transmitted and
reflected particle.

 is an infinite algebra and from the above formal definition
it is not obvious at all that it has an operator
realization. Since such a realization is needed in the physical
applications, we will
construct in the next section an explicit representation of  in
terms of (generally
unbounded) operators, which act in a Hilbert space.


Fock representation 

We consider below representations of the RT algebra with involution
 with the following structure:
 

(i)  the representation space is a complex Hilbert space  with
scalar product ;

(ii)  the generators


are operator-valued distributions with common and invariant dense
domain , where eqs. ()-() hold;

(iii)  the involution  is realized as a
conjugation with respect to .

A Fock representation is further specified by the condition:
 

(iv)  there exists a vacuum state ,
which is annihilated by . The vector  is
cyclic with respect to  and
.


There is a number of simple, but quite important consequences from
the assumptions
(i-iv). We start with
 
  The reflection-transmission
automorphism 
is realized in any Fock representation by the identity operator.

  We consider the matrix element
( , a_(_1) -
[a_(_1)] P[a^])  ,
where  is an arbitrary state in  and 
is an arbitrary polynomial in . Applying the identity
a_(_1) - [a_(_1)]a^ (_2) =
a^ (_2) _ ^ (_1, _2)
a_(_1) - [a_(_1)]  ,
which follows after some algebra from the exchange relations
(), (), (),
we can shift the curly bracket in () to the vacuum and
deduce from (iv) that
( , a_() -
[a_()] P[a^]) = 0 .
Taking the complex conjugate of (), we obtain
(P [a^*] , a^  () -
[a^  ()]) = 0 .
 Finally, using the cyclicity of , we conclude that
a^  () = [a^  ()]
= a^  () t^_() +
a^  (-) r^_(-)
holds on . Analogously, we derive
a_() = [a_()]
= t_^() a_() +
r_^() a_(-) .
Notice that the reflection-transmission identities (), ()
generalize the -impurity relations (), ().

 

In what follows we are going to show that any RT algebra 
admits in general a whole
family  of Fock representations, which can be parametrized by
means of the vacuum
expectation values
_^() = ( , r_^() )
 , _^() = ( , t_^() )  ,
called in what follows transmission and reflection matrices. Their
basic properties
are collected in


        In each Fock representation of :
 
(a)   and  satisfy the Hermitian
analyticity conditions
^() = (-) ,
^() = () ;
(b)  the vacuum state  is unique (up to a phase
factor) and satisfies
r_^() = _^()  , t_^() = _^()  .
(c)   and  obey the
consistency relations
_12 (_1 , _2) _2(_1)
_12 (_2 , -_1) _2(_2) = 

_2(_2) _12 (_1 , -_2) _2(_1)
_12 (-_2 , -_1) ,
_12 (_1 , _2) _2(_1)
_12 (_2 , _1) _2(_2) = 

_2(_2) _12 (_1 , _2) _2(_1)
_12 (_2 , _1) ,
_12 (_1 , _2) _2(_1)
_12 (_2 , _1) _2(_2) = 

_2(_2) _12 (_1 , -_2)
_2(_1) _12  (-_2 , _1) ,
and unitarity conditions
() () + () (-) =  ,
() () + () (-) = 0  .
  The statement (a) is a direct consequence of
() and point (iii) above.
Concerning (b), the argument implying the uniqueness of the vacuum is standard
(see e.g.). The identities in () can be deduced from
([r_^() - _^()] ,
P[a^]) = 0
and
([t_^() - _^()] ,
P[a^]) = 0
respectively,  being an arbitrary polynomial.
 For proving () and (), one can shift by Hermitian
conjugation the polynomial to the first
factor and use afterwards the exchange relations () and ()
and eq. ().
Finally, (b) can be verified by taking the vacuum expectation values
of ()-() and
(), () and using (). This concludes the argument.

 

We thus recover at the level of Fock representation the well-known
boundary Yang-Baxter equation (). A novel feature is the presence
of transmission () and transmission-reflection ()
Yang-Baxter equations.
Using (), eq. () can be equivalently rewritten in the form
_12 (_1 , _2) _2(_1)
_12 (_2 , -_1) _2(_2) = 

_2(_2) _12 (_1 , _2)
_2(_1) _12  (_2 , -_1) .
Let us elaborate now a bit more on the relation between  and .
Because of (), (),  and 

are non-negative Hermitian matrices which, according to (), are
simultaneously diagonalizable. The corresponding eigenvalues satisfy
_i() + _i() = 1 ,_i() 0 ,
_i() 0 , i=1,...,N.
Solving eq. () for , one finds
() =
() - () (-)  = ()_n=0 ^_n  [()(-)]^n  ,
where  is some unknown function and the coefficients
 are determined by .
The conditions () ensure that the series is convergent and
imposing (), () and () on (),
one obtains
 () = () , ()^2 = 1 ,
(-) = - ()  .
The series representation () of the matrix  allows to infer
the following remarkable property.

   For any solution  of the boundary
Yang-Baxter equation () ,
 defined by ()  satisfies (), () .

  The statement can be proven in two steps. The first one is to show that
the matrix  obeys () and
(), which is done by repeated use of (). The second step
is based on the identities
_12 (_1 , _2) [_2(_1)]^m
_12 (_2 , _1) [_2(_2)]^n =

 [_2(_2)] ^n _12 (_1 , _2) [_2(_1)]^m
_12 (_2 , _1) ,
_12 (_1 , _2) [_2(_1)]^n
_12 (_2 , _1) _2(_2) =


_2(_2) _12 (_1 , -_2)
[_2(_1)]^n _12  (-_2 , _1) ,
which hold for any integers  and are the consequence
of a recurrent application of (), ().

 

It is worth mentioning that the above argument makes no use
of the values of
coefficients  in () and the conclusion of 
proposition 3.3 remains
valid for any convergent series in powers of .

Summarizing, we have shown that the transmission and
transmission-reflection Yang-Baxter equations () and ()
are a consequence of
Hermitian analyticity (), (), unitarity 
(), (),
() and
the boundary Yang-Baxter equation ().

We turn now to the Fock representations of .
Our goal will be to demonstrate that each doublet
, satisfying (), (),
(), () and (), fully
determines a Fock representation  of . For this purpose
we shall construct
 explicitly, extending the projection operator technique
developed in for the
ZF and boundary algebras, which are particular cases of .
The first step is to introduce the -particle subspace
 of . For this purpose we consider
= _  L^2()  ,
equipped with the standard scalar product
(, ) =
_- ^d ^  ()
_() =
_  _- ^d  _() _()  .
The -particle space  we are looking for
is a subspace of the -fold tensor power ,
characterized by a suitable projection operator . In order to
construct , we proceed as follows. Observing that any element

can be viewed as a column whose entries are
, we
define the operators 

acting on  according to:
&[^(n) _i]__1 ... _n  
(_1,...,_i,_i+1 ,...,_n ) = 

&[_ii+1 (_i,_i+1 )
]__1 ... _n  ^_1 ... _n  
__1 ... _n  
(_1,...,_i+1 ,_i,...,_n ) , n2 ,
[^(n) ]__1 ... _n  
(_1,...,_n ) =
__n  ^_n (_n)
__1 ... _n-1 _n 
(_1,...,_n-1 ,_n ) + 

__n  ^_n (_n)
__1 ... _n-1 _n 
(_1,...,_n-1 ,-_n ) , n1 ,
where
[_ij (_i,_j)
]__1 ... _n  ^_1 ... _n   =
__1 ^_1 
 __i ^_i   
 __j ^_j   
__n ^_n 
 __i _j ^_i _j (_i,_j)  .
 In order to implement eqs. (), () on the whole
,
we assume at this stage that the matrix elements
,
 and  are bounded functions.
Now, one can prove


  Let 
be the Weyl group associated with the root systems of
the classical Lie algebra  and let
 be the generators of .
The mapping
_n : _i _i^(n)  , _n : ^(n)  ,
defines a representation of  in . Moreover,
P^(n)  12^n n! 
__n   _n()
is an orthogonal projection operator in .

  One has by construction
&_i^(n)  _j^(n)  =
_j^(n)  _i^(n)  , i-j2  , 

&_i^(n)  = _i^(n)   , 1i<n-2  .
Using the Yang-Baxter equations
(), ()-(), (), one
shows that
_i^(n)  _i+1 ^(n)  _i^(n)   & =
_i+1 ^(n)  _i^(n)  _i+1 ^(n)   ,  

_n-1 ^(n)    _n-1 ^(n)   &=
 _n-1 ^(n)    _n-1 ^(n)   .
The unitarity conditions () and (), 
() imply
[_i^(n) ]^2 = ^2 = 1   .
Consequently,  is a representation of  in  and
 is a projection operator. Finally, from Hermitian analyticity
(), (), (), one infers that 

are Hermitian operators. Therefore,  is orthogonal.

 

We have at this stage enough background to construct the Fock
representation
. The -particle space is defined by
^(0)  =  , ^(n)  = P^(n)  ^n  ,n1 ,
the total Fock space being
= _n=0 ^^(n)   .
The finite particle space  is the (complex) linear space of sequences



with  and  for
 large enough.  is dense in .
The vacuum state is  and belong to .
The smeared bulk operators 
act on  as follows:
a(f) = 0 ,
[a(f) ]__1_n ^(n) (_1,...,_n) =
n+1  _- ^d f^_0   ()
__0 _1 _n ^(n+1)  (, _1,...,_n)
 ,
[a^(f) ]__1_n ^(n) (_1,...,_n)
= n  [P^(n)  f^(n-1) 
]__1_n (_1,...,_n)  .
In general,  and  are unbounded operators on . For any
 one has however the estimate
a^(f) ^(n)    n 
f
^(n)   ,
where  stands for  or .
Therefore  and  are bounded on each .

We now turn to the defect generators, defining 
and  as the following multiplicative operators on :
&[r_^() ]__1 ...
_n ^(n) (_1,...,_n) =
[_01 (,_1)  _12 (,_2)_(n-1)
n (,_n) _n()

&_(n-1) n (_n,-)_12 (_2,-)
 _01 (_1,-)]__1 ...
_n ^_1 ... _n 
^(n) __1 ... _n (_1,...,_n)  , 

&[t_^() ]__1 ...
_n ^(n) (_1,...,_n) =
[_01 (,_1)  _12 (,_2)_(n-1)
n (,_n)_n()

&_(n-1) n (_n,)_12 (_2,)
 _01 (_1,)]__1 ...
_n ^_1 ... _n 
^(n) __1 ... _n (_1,...,_n)  ,
combined with (). As expected, the defect operators
preserve the bulk particle number.

 For deriving the commutation properties of
(), (), (), () on , it
is convenient to introduce the operator-valued distributions
 and  defined by
a(f) = _- ^d f^ ()a_()  ,
a^(f)
= _- ^d f_()a^ ()  .
A straightforward computation allows to prove now


  The operator-valued distributions
 and
satisfy the exchange relations ()-()  and the
constraints
()  and ()  on . The involution  is
realized as Hermitian conjugation with respect to the scalar product
() .

This result completes the construction of the Fock representation ,
which is the basic tool in the physical applications discussed in
this paper. Fixing ,
 is indeed fully determined by  satisfying
eqs. (), (), ()-(). Besides
some concrete examples,
little is known in general about the solution set of the latter.
There exist, however, one particular case
of physical importance, which is described in
  Suppose that
 obeys
_12 (_1,_2)_2(_1) = _1(_1)_12 (-_1,_2) .
Then  satisfies the boundary Yang-Baxter equation () .
Moreover,  obeys
_12 (_1,_2)_2(_1) = _1(_1)_12 (_1,_2)  ,
and
r_^() = _^()  ,
t_^() = _^()  ,
hold for all .
 
  Eq. () follows directly from
() and (). The identity () is a consequence of
() and the series representation (). Equations
() follow from
(), () and (), (). Note also that
(), () are
recovered from (), () and ().

 

The condition () sort of linearizes eqs. ()-()
and defines a special subset of representations 
,
whose defect operators are proportional to the identity in .
All Fock representations of the algebras  and ,
introduced above in the context of -impurities, belong to
this subset because () is identically satisfied for the
bosonic and fermionic exchange factors
__1 _2 ^_1 _2 (_1, _2) =
 __1 ^_2  __2 ^_1   .
Let us observe in this respect that  and , given by
(), (), obey
Hermitian analyticity (, ) and unitarity
(, ).



Factorized scattering with impurities 

We develop in this section a general approach to factorized
scattering in (1+1)-dimensional
integrable models with impurity.

Kinematics 

Let  and  be the energy and momentum of any asymptotic bulk particle.
Usually  and  are not independent and obey some dispersion relation.
The latter can be implemented expressing both  and 
in terms of one parameter , namely
E = E() , p = p() .
It is instructive to keep in mind the following two examples:
 
  Relativistic dispersion relation
E() = m () , p() = m () ,
where  is the mass and  the rapidity.

  Non-relativistic dispersion relation
E() = m^2 2  + U , p() = m ,
 being the velocity and  some constant.
Note that both of these relations satisfy
(p) = () ,
 being the sign function. We also observe
   that a Lorentz boost in () and
a Galilean transformation in () are both realized by a translation
.

In what follows we adopt a dispersion relation (), which satisfies
() but is otherwise generic and parametrizes
any asymptotic bulk particle by  and its isotopic index
.
Assuming that the impurity, localized at , has no
internal degrees of freedom, and taking into account
(), the fundamental building blocks of factorized scattering are:
 

(i)  the two-body bulk scattering matrix

defined on ;

(ii)  the right and left reflection matrices 

and ,
defined on  and  respectively and describing the
reflection of a particle from the impurity;

(iii)  the left and right transmission matrices 

and ,
defined on  and  respectively and describing the
transmission of a particle by the impurity.

We emphasize that  is allowed to depend on  and  separately
, generalizing the previous attempts
, where
 is assumed
to depend on  only. As already argued in
, this last condition
is too restrictive and quite artificial in the presence of defects.
With the dispersion relation () for instance,
 turns out to be Lorentz-invariant.
But we know that Lorentz symmetry is generally broken by impurities.
Accordingly, we
allow  to depend on  and  separately. This
leads to a natural generalization of the inverse
scattering  method, which avoids the no-go theorem of
 and
describes a large set of integrable systems, not covered there.

One should also keep in mind that our transmission and reflection matrices
are not defined on the whole , but only for values of 
in the relative physical kinematic domains specified in (ii) and (iii).
This information must be sufficient for reconstructing
the total scattering operator  and we demonstrate below that this is
indeed the case.

The data  are subject to a number of constraints,
ensuring physical unitarity of the scattering operator  and
factorization of the transition amplitudes. Let us first concentrate on
unitarity. Since integrability implies particle number conservation,
the restriction  of  to the one-particle subspace is
a well-defined
operator. One has (see also eq. () below)
^(1) () =( ) ,>0 .
Equation () reflects an essential difference with respect to any
Lorentz-invariant
theory, where  is mandatory. Unitarity
^(1) () [^(1) ]^() =
[^(1) ]^() ^(1) () = implies
&R^() [R^]^() +
T^() [T^]^() =  ,
 

&[R^]^() R^() +
[T^]^() T^() =  ,
 

&R^() [T^]^() +
T^() [R^]^() = 0  ,
 

&[R^]^() T^() +
[T^]^() R^() = 0  ,
where .
We stress that ()-() are necessary and sufficient conditions:
any violation of ()-() breaks down
the unitarity of  and, consequently, of .
It is worth mentioning that in our previous paper&R^() R^() +
T^() T^() =  ,
 

&R^() T^() +
T^() R^() = 0  ,
 

&[R^]^() = R^()  , [T^]^() = T^()
were imposed instead of ()-(). The conditions
()-() are
stronger than ()-() and provide some technical
advantagein dealing with the factorization constraints obtained below. One can
easily see however that
-type defects (see e.g. eq. ())
violate(Correspondence with O.
A. Castro-Alvaredo and
A. Fring on this point is kindly acknowledged.) 
()-(). For this reason we avoid
the use of ()-() in the present paper, keeping
()-() which are respected
by the -impurities described in sect. 2. We conclude the
issue recalling that
bulk scattering unitarity is controlled by
S_12 (_1,_2) S_12 (_2,_1) =  , S_12 ^(_1,_2) = S_12 (_2,_1)  .
 


 
The two-body processes. 


 For analysing the constraints following from factorization, it is
convenient to
display the data  graphically. This is done in
Fig. 1, where the time is flowing along the vertical direction, single lines
denote the particle world lines and the double line is the impurity.
Requiring factorization of all possible three-body processes
leads to a series of relations among ,  and .
As is well-known, the scattering of three
particles implies
the quantum Yang-Baxter equation
S_12 (_1,_2) S_23 (_1,_3) S_12  (_2,_3)
= S_23 (_2,_3) S_12 (_1,_3) S_23 (_1,_2)   ,
whose graphic representation is familiar and is omitted for conciseness.

The consistency conditions stemming from the scattering of two particles
between
themselves and the impurity, can be organized in three groups.

(a) Pure reflection:
&S_12 (_1, _2)R^+_2(_1)S_12 (_2 ,
-_1)R^+_2(_2) = 

&R^+_2(_2)S_12 (_1, -_2)R^+_2(_1)S_12 (-_2, -_1)  ,
 

&S_12 (_1, _2)R^-_1(_2)S_12 (-_2 ,
_1)R^-_1(_1) = 

&R^-_1(_1)S_12 (-_1, _2)R^-_1(_2)S_12 (-_2, -_1)  .
Equations () and () concern the reflection on  and
 respectively. Using the rules in Fig. 1 and moving back in time, one
gets the graphic representation of () shown in Fig. 2.






 
Pure reflection. 

The picture associated to () is obtained from
Fig. 2 by reflection with respect
to the impurity world line.

(b) Pure transmission:
T^+_1(_1)S_12 (_1, _2)T^-_1(_2) =
T^-_2(_2)S_12 (_1, _2)T^+_2(_1)  ,
 

S_12 (_1, _2)T^-_1(_2)T^-_2(_1) =
T^-_1(_1)T^-_2(_2)S_12 (_1, _2) ,
 

S_12 (_1, _2)T^+_1(_2)T^+_2(_1) =
T^+_1(_1)T^+_2(_2)S_12 (_1, _2) .
Equations () and () are represented in Fig. 3(a) and
Fig. 3(b) respectively.






 
Pure transmission. 

As before, the picture corresponding to eq. () is
obtained from Fig. 3(b) by reflection.

(c) Mixed relations:
R^+_1(_1)T^-_2(_2) =
T^-_2(_2)S_12 (_1, _2)R^+_2(_1)S_12 (_2, -_1)  ,
 

T^+_1(_1)R^-_2(_2) =
T^+_1(_1)S_12 (_1, _2)R^-_1(_2)S_12 (-_2, _1)  ,
 

R^+_1(_1)T^+_2(_2) =
S_12 (_1, _2)R^+_2(_1)S_12 (_2, -_1)T^+_2(_2)  ,
 

T^-_1(_1)R^-_2(_2) =
S_12 (_1, _2)R^-_1(_2)S_12 (-_2, _1)T^-_1(_1) ,
 

R^+_1(_1)T^-_2(_2)S_12 (-_1, _2) =
T^-_2(_2)S_12 (_1, _2)R^+_2(_1)  ,
 

T^+_1(_1)R^-_2(_2)S_12 (_1, -_2) =
T^+_1(_1)S_12 (_1, _2)R^-_1(_2)  ,
 

R^+_2(_1)S_12 (_2, -_1)T^+_2(_2) =
S_12 (_2, _1)R^+_1(_1)T^+_2(_2)  ,
 

R^-_1(_2)S_12 (-_2, _1)T^-_1(_1) =
S_12 (_2, _1)T^-_1(_1)R^-_2(_2)  .
Equations () and () are shown in Fig. 4(a) and 4(b)
respectively,
whereas eqs. () and () are drawn in Fig. 4(c) and 4(d).
The pictures related to the remaining four mixed equations are
obtained from Fig. 4 by
reflection, which completes the description of all three-body processes.





 



 



 



 

Mixed relations. 

Summarizing, the scattering data  are required to satisfy
two sets of conditions: unitarity constraints
()-(), () and
factorization constraints ()-(). The general
solution of this
long list of matrix equations is currently unknown. In order to
simplify the problem,
we consider invertible . From eqs. () and
() one then infers that
S_12 (_1,_2)R^_2(_1) =
R^_1(_1)S_12 (-_1,_2) ,
which implies the validity of all
(), (), ()-().
Therefore, assuming that
 are invertible, one is left with
eqs. ()-(), (), (),
()-() and
(), which simplifies a little the problem of deriving
explicit solutions
. At this stage, it might be useful to give some
examples,
starting with the -invariant -matrix
S_12 (_1,_2)=1 s(_1) - s(_2) +i g 
[s(_1) - s(_2)] P_12  +ig 
  ,
where  is the standard flip operator, , and
 is any real valued
even  function. For  and  one derives
&R^() = [p()][iq^()]  ,


&T^() = [p()][iq^()]  ,
 and  being arbitrary real valued functions on .
In this example both reflection and transmission preserve the
isotopic type and
all isotopic types have the same reflection and transmission amplitude.

A more complicated example is provided by the Toda type -matrix
S_i_1i_2 ^j_1j_2 (_1,_2) = [is_i_1i_2 (_1,_2)]
_i_1 ^j_2  _i_2 ^j_1   ,
where  are real valued functions obeying
s_i_1i_2 (_1,_2) = - s_i_2i_1 (_2,_1) , s_i_1i_2 (_1,_2) = s_i_1i_2 (_1,-_2) .
When  satisfy () but are
otherwise generic, one finds
[R^]_i^j() = [p_i()][iq_i^()] _i^j ,
[T^]_i^j() = [p_i()][iq_i^()] _i^j ,
where  and  are real valued functions on .
Also here the impurity interaction preserves the isotopic type, but
the individual
reflection and transmission amplitudes may be different. Finally, if
some of the
entries  coincide, non-diagonal elements
in  and 
are allowed and the isotopic type is not preserved.


Scattering operator and transition amplitudes 

We have so far described in great detail the main features of the physical data
 for factorized scattering with impurity. The
next step is to identify
the RT algebra  and its Fock representation  producing
the total scattering operator  and the transition amplitudes,
corresponding to
. For this purpose we set
(_1 , _2) =
(
S(_1,_2) & 0 & 0 & 0 0 & 0 & S(_1,_2) & 0 0 & S(_1,_2) & 0 & 0 0 & 0 & 0 & S(_1,_2)  )  ,
() =
()( )
+
(-)( ) ,
() =
()( ) +
(-)( ) ,,  and  defined above are admissible because of


  The constraints ()-(),
(), () 
and ()  on the data  imply the validity of
(), (), (), (), (),
(), (), ()  for .

  We first observe that the condition of
Hermitian analyticity
(), () for  and  is satisfied by construction.
The remaining conditions can be checked by direct computation.

 

Thus, eq. () determines the algebra , whereas
(), () fix the
representation  in terms of .
We stress that eq. () implies (). Therefore,
according to proposition , 
. In other words,
the factorization conditions derived in sect. 4.1 select representations from
the subclass .

The asymptotic states in  are defined in complete analogy
with the -impurity
case, discussed in sect. 2. The presence of internal degrees of freedom can
be dealt with in a straightforward way. In-states are created from the vacuum
by  and
.
The out-states are generated instead by
 and
.
By means of (), one can also order the
creation operators according to the values of the spectral parameter,
using the relation  introduced in sect. 2. We thus
define the "in"-coming states by
g_1,i_1;...;g_m,i_m^in  =
a^(_1, i_1) (g_1)a^(_m, i_m) (g_m)  ,
where
g_1 g_m  , _i =
   .
The "out"-going states are given by
 ^out h_1,j_1;...;h_n,j_n =
a^(_1, j_1) (h_1)a^(_n, j_n) (h_n)  ,
with
h_n h_1  , _j =
   .
The asymptotic spaces  and  are
generated by finite
linear combinations of vectors of the type () and
() respectively.
Each of these spaces is dense in . The total
scattering operator 
is defined by
S  : a^(_1, j_1) (h_1)a^(_n,
j_n) (h_n) a^( _1, j_1) (h _1)a^( _n, j_n) (h _n)  ,
where
h _k () = h_k( -) ,  _k
= - _k  .
Using the non-overlapping conditions (), (), it is
not difficult to check that
(S ^out  , S ^out ) =
(^out  , ^out )  , ^out ,  ^out  ^out   .
Generalizing the argument of,
we deduce from (), () that  is unitary.

A generic scattering amplitude reads
& ^out h_1,j_1;...;h_n,j_n
g_1,i_1;...;g_m,i_m^in  = 

&(a^(j_1,_1) (h_1)a^(j_n,_n) (h_n)  ,
a^(i_1,_1) (g_1)a^(i_m,_m) (g_m ) )
and can be computed by means of the exchange relation () and
the identities ().
The Fock structure implies that () vanishes unless ,
showing the absence of particle production as expected from integrability.
The one-particle transition amplitudes can be deduced from
the correlation function
&(a^ () , 
a^ () ) =   

&[^ _ +
  ^ _ ()](  ^ _ () (+)  .
One gets

 ^out h,jg,i^in   =
 
  .
which describe the particle-impurity interaction and precisely reproduce
the one-particle scattering matrix  given by eq. ().

The particle-particle interaction shows up
in the two-particle amplitudes, which can be derived from the correlator

(a^_1 (_1) a^_2 (_2 )  ,
 a^_1 (_1) a^_2 (_2 ) )  =    &&[^__2  +  ^__2  (_2 )]

The associated scattering processes are displayed in Fig. 4 (c,d).
All possible kinematic domains, respecting the
non-overlapping conditions (), (), give rise to
nine different two-particle transition
amplitudes, which are reported in.

Summarizing, the physical scattering data 
determine both the
RT algebra  and its Fock representation  entering the
derivation of the
-matrix amplitudes. The asymptotic states are obtained by
acting with the particle creation
operators on the standard Fock vacuum . It is worth
stressing that
our scheme makes no use of any auxiliary construction of a boundary state  with
prescribed reflection and transmission properties.
This essential difference with respect to all previous approaches
of the subject-represents a relevant theoretical
and technical advantage of the framework based on the RT algebra .

We emphasize, in conclusion, that the above scattering theory is based
entirely on the
data  for real  values of the spectral parameter
. For this reason the results of this work are very general and
remain valid also after imposing
all physical conditions (such as crossing symmetry and certain
meromorphic structure)
on the continuation of  to the complex -plane.

Conclusions and perspectives 

We developed in this article a framework for dealing with factorized scattering
from reflecting and transmitting impurities in 1+1 dimensions.
Our starting point was the analysis of some exactly solvable models
with -type
impurities, which led us directly to the main tool of our
approach, the RT algebra .
The interaction of a particle with the impurity is implemented in
 by the reflection and transmission generators

and  respectively.
As already mentioned, setting 
, one gets from  another useful algebra , which
describesfactorized  scattering from a purely reflecting boundary. In this
context  applies also
to the construction of off-shell correlation functions
 and to the study of symmetries
. Moreover, setting 
,
one obtains the celebrated ZF algebra. Therefore, 
indeed represents a universal structure for dealing with integrable models
in 1+1 dimensions.

The Fock representations of  also exhibit remarkable features.
The operators  condense in
the vacuum . The relative condensates
 are
directly related to the physical reflection and  transmission amplitudes.
There is no need for special boundary or reflection-transmission states
in our scheme. The use of the standard Fock vacuum  for
deriving the asymptotic states significantly simplifies the construction.

We established a complete set of factorization conditions for scattering
with impurities in 1+1 dimensions, showing that they
admit solutions with non-trivial bulk scattering if
the requirement of Lorentz (Galilean) invariance on the bulk -matrix is
relaxed. This feature, which is not surprising in the presence of
defects, allows the no-go theorem ofto be avoided.

The concept of RT algebra, introduced in this paper, opens a variety
of new directions for further
research. On the mathematical side, the interplay between ,
 and ZF algebras
deserves a more detailed analysis. A link between  and the ZF
algebra has been
explored in. From the physical point of view,
 appears to be the natural
candidate for replacing the ZF algebra in the form-factor program for
integrable models with
impurities. The construction of off-shell local fields in this context is
a challenging open problem. We strongly believe that besides to
integrable systems,
RT algebras apply also to (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theory
with permeable
walls, which partly transmit and partly reflect the incident waves.
Such theories
 have obvious relevance to
critical phenomena and have recently acquired
some importance in the theory of strings and branes. Finally, for
applications to
impurity problems in condensed-matter physics, one needs finite temperature
representations of the RT algebras, which requires the construction
of Kubo-Martin-Schwinger
states over . We are currently investigating some of these issues.
