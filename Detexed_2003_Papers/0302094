A set of Markov processes corresponding to systems of
 hard-core particles interacting   along the line
are shown to be solvable via a dynamic matrix product
ansatz (DMPA). We show that quantum spin Hamiltonians
can be treated by the DMPA as well, and demonstrate how
the DMPA, originally formulated for systems with open 
ends,  works for periodic systems.

Recent advances in nonequilibrium statistics have 
allowed for the clarification of many important issues such as
exact description of nonequilibrium phase transitions,
microscopic structure of shocks, dynamical scaling etc..
Dynamical systems of stochastically hopping hard 
core particles (the so-called exclusion processes) 
have been at the heart of this development, in particular
due to remarkable observation that one can find exactly
the probabilities of all system configurations in a stationary
state. It was subsequently noticed that for
the totally symmetric exclusion process one can as 
well solve the evolution dynamics, namely to find conditional
probabilities  of the system being at state 
at time  provided that it was in state  at time
 via coordinate Bethe Ansatz. 
The dynamical matrix product ansatz (DMPA) proposed
in has recovered
the results of  in a more straighforward manner. But 
for technical reasons to be explained later, application
of the DMPA was incomplete in periodic
systems.

In this communication, we show how  the DMPA is applied for 
periodic systems. Alongside, we demonstrate that the DMPA can
be used for testing the stochastic processes and/or 
one-dimensional 
spin chains for integrability. The integrability restrictions
come from the consistency conditions on the algebra generated by
the DMPA, which has  to satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. The 
important difference from the conventional approach is that
we start directly from the Hamiltonian and do not need 
a parameter-dependent transfer matrix, commuting with it.

The continuous time 
dynamics of Markov process is defined via the master 
equation for the probability  of the system being at state 
at time ,

MasterEq 
P(,t) / t = 
_P(w_  -
 P(,t) _w_where  is the rate with which 
the system can change its configuration from 
 to  .

For definiteness we consider a system of identical particles 
 on a lattice  of  sites. 
Each site  can be either occupied by a particle
(local occupation number ) or be empty
( ). The set of occupation numbers for all sites
constitutes the configuration of the system.
The system can change its configuration via  hopping of any particle to an
empty nearest neighbour site.
At  any infinitesimally small
moment of time  at most one such process can happen, 
namely the particle can hop to the empty site to the right/to the left
with the rates  and  respectively.
Now, consider a vector space .  Notice that 
one can establish one-to-one correspondence between configurational space of
 our particle system and canonical basis of   ; 
  , with the scalar product
 . 
The local particle number operators  
have form  , 
and   respectively for holes.  denotes a matrix 
with  , and it stays in the -th place in 
the tensor product expression above.  is the unit  matrix.  

With the help of above notations the set of equations ()
can be rewritten as single vector equation ( we ask the  reader to refer e.g. 
to for the details of the scheme).
 
 MasterVector 
d P (t) d t  = - H  P (t)
where 
,

.

Due to the fact that the hopping is restricted to the nearest-neighbouring sites,
 the Hamiltonian above is the sum of local two-site Hamiltonians,

 given by
h_stochastic 
4 h_n,n+1 = 
D_R (
(1-_n^z)(1+_n+1 ^z)- _n^+ _n+1 ^-
)+ 
 D_L (
(1+_n^z)(1-_n+1 ^z)- _n^- _n+1 ^+
) 
where  are Pauli matrices.


Note that () has a form of a Schrodinger equation 
in imaginary time, and the Hamiltonian ()
the form of a  nonhermitian spin Hamiltonian with nearest neighbour exchange
 interaction.

 The global Hamiltonian  possesses an U(1) 
symmetry, . 
The general hermitian spin Hamiltonian satisfying the latter 
relation is  Hamiltonian,
XXZ 
H= J  _n _n^x _n+1 ^x +  _n^y _n+1 ^y 
+ ( _n^z _n+1 ^z - I ). 
Thus Schrodinger quantum problem and Markov process for interacting
particles are closely connected. In the following we show how to
find the spectrum of  and how to single
out integrable models.



To demonstrate how the DMPA works, we start from the Hamiltonian of the 
form
both 
H=_n=1 ^L h_n,n+1 ;   h= 
(
 
)
 with arbitrary entries , which contains both the stochastic  
() and quantum spin system
(). We shall consider a system  on a ring with  sites.

One proposes to search for time-dependent probability 
distribution vector  in the following form:

MPS 
P (t) Tr  
[
(c  E 
 D )^L-1 
(c  EQ 
 D Q  )
]
where  are some time-dependent matrices.
The probability of a given configuration  is given by the scalar product 
of the above vector with the basis vector  of the configuration,
. For example, 
probability  of a state  for a system 
of 5 sites is sought 
in the form ,
up to normalization.


One  requires matrices  such that 
() satisfies the master equation  ().
To simplify matters, first take  in () to be a unit matrix  
(this would allow to retrieve the translationally invariant part of the 
 spectrum as we shall see below). 
Given that, and that the 
 Hamiltonian in () splits into local ones,
 ,
it is sufficient for the purpose that the matrices  satisfy
quadratic relation

DMPA_4 
(
1 2  d dt  + h  
)
E D   E D   = 
X^0 X   E D   -  E D   X^0 X  
conveniently written in short form 
 short 
( 1 2 d dt  + h ) A  A 
= X A  -  A  X .
where , 
 .

For  which is generic case
 one gets two additional relations in addition to (),
connected with the action of the terms 
of the Hamiltonian:
 ( 1 2 d dt  + h ) A  A  Q  &=& 
 X A  Q  -  A  X Q 

( 1 2 d dt  + h ) A Q  A  &=& 
 X Q A   -  A Q  X  
Equation () gives the relations for the matrices 
 while  Eqs. (,) impose 
restrictions on .

 Equation () has four components:
1 2 (E E + EE )  &=&  X^0E - EX^0 

1 2 (E D + ED ) + f  E D  + u DE 
                                            & =&  X^0D - EX

1 2 (D E + DE )  + g D E + vED
                                            & =&  X E - D X^0 

1 2 (D D + DD )  &=&  XD - DX 
Using the reduction 
Edot 
E =0; X^0=0,
Eq. () is satisfied trivially.
Supposing additionally that   exists, 
we obtain from  (), (): 
X 
2 X =  (g-f) D + vED E^-1  -u E^-1 D E;
Ddot 
 D  + (g+f) D + vED E^-1  + u E^-1 D E=0
Substituting  into  (), one gets:
DD 
(g+f) DD + u D E^-1 D E  + vE D E^-1  D =0 
Now, consider the  two equations (,) with 
 present.
First, suppose that  is time-independent, and  exists.
Then, Eq.() is satisfied with the choices (-)
since multiplication of  () by  from the right reduces 
() to (). In order to satisfy Eq.() with
the choice (-),the matrix  must obey
Q 
[Q,DE^-1 ] = [Q,E^-1 D] = 0.
Note that in general we assume that  
 does not commute neither with  nor with  separately, 
. 


Proceeding along the lines, we can get rid of 
time-dependence of  via a formal Fourier Transform
FT 
D _p(t)  =  _k  e ^ipk  E^k-1 D(t) E^-k  
Indeed, it follows from () that 

EDE 
E^-1  D _p(t) E =  e ^ip  D _p(t);  
Substituting  (), () into (), one gets


 
with the "dispersion relation"
dispersion 
 _p= g+f + v e ^-ip  + u e ^ip 
 
The inverse Fourier Transform is 
InvFT 
D(t) = E 1 2  _- ^  d p D _p(t)=
 E 1 2  _- ^  d p  e ^-_p t  D _p(0)
In what follows we shall omit the time argument 
in initial matrices   .
Inserting () into (), and using (),
one obtains:

FTeq4 
 E^2  2   _- ^  _- ^ 
e ^-(_p_1 +_p_2  )t 
D _p_1 D _p_2  a(p_1,p_2) d p_1 d p_2 = 0
where
a 
 a(p_1,p_2) = u e ^i p_1 + i p_2  + (f+g) e ^ i p_1   + v
Now, integral in  () may be split in two parts as 
split 
 _- ^  _- ^  d p_1 d p_2=
 _- ^  _- ^p_1  +
_- ^  _p_1 ^  I_p2<p1 + I_p2>p1   
By changing the order of integration and interchanging 
in the last term in () we obtain from ():








Since this is satisfied at all times , we must require the expression
inside the integrand to vanish
Dcomm 
D _p_1  D _p_2  = -   a(p_2,p_1) a(p_1,p_2) 
 D _p_2 D _p_1 
Finally, we require the  matrix  from (,)
to satisfy
, which contains () as a special case and yields
QDp 
[Q,D _p (t)]=0 

To obtain
 Bethe Ansatz equations for the spectrum,
consider the quantity 
DDDD 
Tr   (D _p_1  D _p_2 D _p_N  E^L  Q),
which is the building block of the expression for expectation values. Indeed,
for a system with just two particles 
 the  expectation value , according to (),
(),(),
can be written as  
n_x(t)n_y(t)  = Tr   (E^x-1  D E^y-x-1  D 
E^L-y  Q)/Z_L=& & 

d p_1dp _2
e ^-(_p_1 +_p_2 )t  e ^-ip_1x-ip_2y 
Tr   (D _p_1 D _p_2 E^L Q)/Z_L, & &
where  is an appropriate normalization factor,


.
 Generally,
one is interested in a system with  particles which leads to 
().


Using  (), and commuting  around the circle, one obtains using 
(), () and the cyclic invariance  property of the trace:





and consequently
BA4 
(-1)^N+1  _n=1 ^N  a(p_n,p_k)   a(p_k,p_n)  e ^ip_k L =1
One recognizes in (), ()
the well-known expressions for the spectrum of 
the  spin model, for  
, .   

It may seem that the proposed line of argument is not changed if 
the auxiliary matrix  that we have introduced  is chosen
to be a unity matrix . This  trivial choice however would 
bring about an additional 
relation. Namely let us rewrite ()  as

Q=I 
Tr   (D _p_1  D _p_2 D _p_N  E^L )=
Tr   (D _p_1  D _p_2 D _p_N  E  E^L-1 )
and then commute single  matrix E around the circle. We shall obtain
impulse_zero 
e ^ip_1+ip_2+ip_N = 1
then. This  means putting  (or more generally allowing for
) we recover  only the part of spectrum
 with the total  quasimomentum  equal to zero, .  

We have thus shown how from the Dynamis Matrix Product Ansatz one obtains
the spectrum for spin   chain. Note that until now 
we have not got any restriction on parameters in ().
 This is a consequence of the fact that  
the Hamiltonian () is integrable for any choice of parameters.
In the following we show how the
the  integrability restrictions enter in a more general setting. 


Consider nearest neighbour quantum spin 1 Hamiltonians. 
This case corresponding to three states at a  site, e.g. 
comprises  many integrable systems (see e.g. a list given in where however
several symmetry restrictions are imposed).  With those restrictions being relaxed, 
there are many more, e.g..

To be specific, we shall consider the hermitian Hamiltonian of the 
form 

h_spin1 
h = ( ccccccccc 
0 &   0   &   0   &   0   & 0 &   0   &   0   &   0   & 0 

0 & a&   0   &g_A & 0 &   0   &   0   &   0   & 0 

0 &   0   & b&   0   & 0 &   0   &g_B &   0   & 0 

0 &g_A &   0   & a& 0 &   0   &   0   &   0   & 0 

0 &   0   &   0   &   0   & d &   0   &   0   &   0   & 0 

0 &   0   &   0   &   0   & 0 & c&   0   &g& 0 

0 &   0   &g_B &   0   & 0 &   0   & b&   0   & 0 

0 &   0   &   0   &   0   & 0 &g&   0   & c& 0 

0 &   0   &   0   &   0   & 0 &   0   &   0   &   0   & e )
with  independent parameters. If ,
 and , it reduces to 
isotropic Hamiltonian of Sutherland , where  is permutation operator 
in  defined by  for
any matrices  from .
Again, the complete Hamiltonian has the form  and
we are interested in a solution of Schrodinger equation 
. 

Analogously to () one proposes an Ansatz for  as

MPS_spin1 
P (t) Tr  
[
(c  E 
 D^A 
 D^B )^L-1 
(c  EQ 
 D^A Q 
 D^B Q )
]
with  matrices   referring to local  variable  respectively.

Ansatz  () leads to the equations (,,) 
where now  , 
 . 
Eq.() has 9 components,
written analogously to (-). The first one is satisfied
with the choice ().
Those four that are
linear in , yield analogically to (,):
 A,X 
 D ^A+ 2 a D ^A + 
g_A ( 
 E^-1 D^A E +  ED^A E^-1 
)



and the Eq. for  is obtained by exchanging 
. The additional Eqs.(,) lead to the conditions 
,    
on -matrix.


Eliminating time  derivatives in the four remaining equations 
that are quadratic in  we obtain:
(2a-d) D^A D^A + g_A  (  D^A E^-1 D^A E +  E D^A E^-1  D^A
        ) = 0 & &

(a+b-c) D^A D^B - g  D^B D^A + g_A  E D^A E^-1  D^B + g_B   D^A E^-1 D^B E
 = 0 & &

(a+b-c) D^B D^A - g  D^A D^B + g_A  E D^B E^-1  D^A + g_A   D^B E^-1 D^A E
 = 0 & &

(2b-e) D^B D^B + g_B  (  D^B E^-1 D^B E +  E D^B E^-1  D^B
        ) = 0 & &
One proceeds analogically then to what we have done in the spin  case.
Introducing generalized Fourier Transform
,

leads to eliminating the time-dependence in ():

 where 
eps_A_B 
^A_p= 2 a + g_A (e ^ip  +  e ^-ip /), 
^B_p= 2 b + g_B (e ^ip  +  e ^-ip /).
The inverse Fourier Transform 
,
being inserted into (-), yields 

0 & = & d p_1 d p_2 a_12  D ^A_p_1 
D ^A_p_2  e ^-(^A_p_1 +^A_p_2 )t 

0 & = & d p_1 d p_2 [c_12  D ^A_p_1 
D ^B_p_2  - g e ^ip_2  
D ^B_p_2 D ^A_p_1 ]
e ^-(^A_p_1 +^B_p_2 )t 

0 & = & d p_1 d p_2 [d_12  D ^B_p_1 
D ^A_p_2  - g e ^ip_2  
D ^A_p_2 D ^B_p_1 ]
e ^-(^B_p_1 +^A_p_2 )t 

0 & = & d p_1 d p_2 b_12  D ^B_p_1 
D ^B_p_2  e ^-(^B_p_1 +^B_p_2 )t 
with the functions
a_12  a(p_1,p_2) & = & 
e ^ip_1  (2 a -d) +  g_A  (1+^2 e ^ip_1+ip_2 ) 

b_12  b(p_1,p_2) & = & 
e ^ip_1  (2 b-e) +  g_B  (1+^2 e ^ip_1+ip_2 ) 

c_12  c(p_1,p_2) & = &  (a+b-c) e ^ip_1  +
 g_B  e ^ip_1+ip_2  +  g_A  

d_12  d(p_1,p_2) & = &  (a+b-c) e ^ip_1  +
 g_A  e ^ip_1+ip_2  +  g_B  
The trick with the  and  exchange  in 
(-) leads consequently (see  ()
and the paragraph above it) to 


 D ^A_p_1  D ^A_p_2 =- a_21  a_12    
D ^A_p_2 D ^A_p_1 ;  & &D ^B_p_1 
 D ^B_p_2 = - b_21 b_12  
D ^B_p_2 D ^B_p_1 
 

c_12  D ^A_p_1 D ^B_p_2 
 - g e ^ip_2 D ^B_p_2 D ^A_p_1   &+& 
c_21  D ^A_p_2 D ^B_p_2  
- g e ^ip_1 D ^B_p_1 D ^A_p_2  =0  

d_12  D ^B_p_1  D ^A_p_2  
- g e ^ip_2  D ^A_p_2 D ^B_p_1  &+&
d_21  D ^B_p_2  D ^A_p_1  
- g e ^ip_1  D ^A_p_1 D ^B_p_2  =0  
and a restriction . The latter 
one is a consequence of the constraint 
, 
needed to equate the time-dependent factors after  exchange 
in   (,).

Eqs. (,) can be written in the form 
c_12  d_12  - g^2 e ^2ip_1    
D ^A_p_1  D ^B_p_2  = D ^B_p_2  D ^A_p_1    
 d_12  g e ^ip_2  -  d_21  g e ^ip_1  
 
+ D ^A_p_2  D ^B_p_1   
 g^2 e ^ip_1+ip_2  -  d_12  c_21 
 
 & & 

D ^B_p_1  D ^A_p_2  = D ^A_p_2  D ^B_p_1    
 c_12  g e ^ip_2  -  c_21  g e ^ip_1  
 
+ D ^B_p_2  D ^A_p_1   
 g^2 e ^ip_1+ip_2  -  c_12  d_21 
 
The Eqs.(,,)
 between the Fourier components  define an algebra 
conveniently written via a scattering matrix  as
S 
D _p_1 ^Z D _p_2 ^Z'  =
S_Y Y' ^Z Z' (p_1,p_2)  D _p_2 ^Y'  D _p_1 ^Y
Applying it twice we see that it  satisfies the inversion relation
( means transposition) 
. 

Now, note that application of ()  exchange the order of indexes  and .
For the cubic terms
 the  exchange 
of order of indexes  can be done either by subsequent series of 
  or
   exchanges. Associativity  of the algebra
requires the result to be the same in both cases, which amounts to
YBE 
S^ij _i''j" (p_1,p_2) S^i''k _i'k" (p_1,p_3) S^j''k" _j'k' (p_2,p_3) =
S^jk _j''k" (p_2,p_3) S^ik" _i''k' (p_1,p_3) S^i''j" _i'j' (p_1,p_2) .
This is the Yang-Baxter equation (YBE). Summing over repeating indexes is
implied. The YBE guarantees the consistency of the 
algebra on the cubic and further levels.  

The YBE impose severe restrictions on the  matrix elements, which 
depend on the coefficients of the Hamiltonian ().
Nontrivial solutions of the YBE  single out integrable models. 
We have investigated  ()  with the help of Mathematica, and found the
following solution:

i_1 ,    
 g_B=i_1 g_A,   & &
g_A = i_2 g,    
d= 2 a + (i_3 -1) g,    
 


e= 2 b + (i_4 -1) g,    & &
c= a+b+ i_5 g,  






where .

Sutherland's and, more generally,
solution  4 of is contained in the above.
To the best of our knowledge, the general manifold describes
a new solution to the YBE.


To summarise, the Dynamic Matrix Product State method turns out to be 
an effective tool 
to check the integrability of both stochastic processes and 
quantum Hamiltonians. 
Applying it saves the conventional tedious step of calculating 
parameter-dependent transfer matrices satisfyng the the Yang-Baxter equation,
commuting with the original Hamiltonian.  E.g. for investigating
spin  chains conventionally, we would need first to solve YBE with 
in principle  
independent components. In the DMPA approach  we needed only the original Hamiltonian
to start with, and then additionally to solve at most  equations ()
for the algebra associativity. (In fact the number of equations is 
much  smaller
due to symmetries).   At the same time, we believe that for 
all the integrable models obtained 
the commuting transfer-matrices do exist, although we do not need them directly. 
Also, Bethe Ansatz equations for the spectrum can be constructed directly 
from the algebra, as was demonstrated for  model (see ()).
For the other models  the  Bethe Ansatz equations are
readily constructed by  following e.g. the algebraic approach.
   
The DMPA approach does not make reference to the actual representations of the 
matrices involved. However, it would 
be interesting to find them. In special cases (namely, when they are not
time dependent, which means only stationary (ground) state is investigated) 
the representations are known .
