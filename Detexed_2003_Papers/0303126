Abstract. 

We construct a parafermionic conformal theory with the symmetry
, for  odd, based on the second solution of
Fateev-Zamolodchikov for the corresponding parafermionic chiral
algebra. Primary operators are classified according to their transformation
properties under the dihedral group , as singlet, doublet 
, and disorder operators. In an assumed Coulomb gas
scenario, the corresponding vertex operators are accommodated by the weight
lattice of the Lie algebra . The unitary theories are
representations of the coset
, with .
Physically, they realise the series of multicritical points in
statistical theories having a  symmetry.


Introduction 

Parafermionic algebras are associated in a natural way with extra
discrete group symmetries in two-dimensional statistical systems.

The most used parafermionic conformal theory, which was constructed by Fateev
and Zamolodchikov in Ref. , describes the self-dual critical
points of the Z-invariant generalisations of the Ising model.
The values of the spins of the parafermions take the minimal possible
values admitted by the associativity constraints for the corresponding chiral
algebra. In this case, the central charge of the Virasoro algebra is fixed as
a function of  only; there is only one conformal field theory for each .

In the Appendix A of Ref. , the same authors showed that there
exists another associative chiral algebra, with the next allowed values of the
spins of the parafermions. In this second solution, the central charge and the
structure constants of the algebra are given, for each , as functions of a
free parameter.

The conformal field theories which correspond to this second solution are
known only for particular values of .

The case  corresponds to the superconformal theory (). For
, the parafermionic algebra turns out to factorise into two independent
superconformal chiral algebras, with fields of dimensions  and . The
theory with  has been fully developed by Fateev and Zamolodchikov in
Ref. . By imposing the degeneracy condition on the
representations fields, they constructed an infinite series of conformal
theories. These theories are supposed to describe the multicritical fixed
points of physical statistical systems with the  symmetry. Indeed, the
first theory of this series corresponds to the tricritical Potts model.

In a recent paper, we presented the theory based on the second
solution of the  parafermionic algebra. In particular, by studying the
degenerate representations of this algebra we showed that the representation
fields are accommodated by the weight lattice of the Lie algebra .

To obtain this result it was useful observing that the central charge of the
second solution of the  parafermionic algebra agrees with that of the
coset SO_n (N)SO_2 (N) SO_n+2 (N) ,
 
which is 
 c &=& (N-1) ( 1-N(N-2) p(p+2)  ),  

 p &=& N-2+n. It is then natural to look for a Kac formula for the dimensions of the primary
operators based on the weight lattice of the Lie algebra 
for  (with ), and of  for
 (with ).

In the present work we will present in detail the whole class of the conformal
theories based on the second solution of the  parafermionic algebra.

The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the
parafermionic algebra presented in Ref. . We then discuss the
operator content of the theory together with the modules induced by the
primary operators. The commutation relations of the parafermionic modes in
each sector are given and some results of the degeneracy calculations are
shown. These results, together with the properties of the Coulomb gas
realisation of the theory, will be used in Section 3 to fix the values of the
boundary terms characterising each sector. Finally, in Section 4 we determine
to which sector each operator of the theory belongs. The theory we have built
is verified by considering the characteristic equations for three-point
functions. The conclusions are given in Section 5.

Parafermionic algebra and representation space 

As discussed in the Introduction, we will consider the second solution of the
associative algebra presented in Appendix A of Ref. . The operator
product expansions, defining the algebra of the parafermionic currents
 (with ), have the form:
 ^k (z)^k' (z') &=& ^k,k' _k+k'  (z-z')^_k 
 +_k' -_k+k'    

 && ^k+k' (z')+(z-z')
 _k+k' +_k -_k'  2_k+k'  
 _z' ^k+k' (z')+,k+k'0 

   

 ^k (z)^-k (z') &=& 1 (z-z')^2_k   
 1+(z-z')^2 
 2_k  c T(z')+.
 In Eqs. ()-(), the conformal dimension  of
the parafermionic current  is given by:
 _k =_N-k =2k(N-k) N ,   k=1,2,,N-1 2 .
 Note that in the above equations and in the rest of the present manuscript,
the -charges  and their sums  are defined modulo . In
particular we write:
 ^N-k ^-k (^k )^+ ,_N-k 
 _-k . Within the second solution, the structure constants 
and the central charge  of the Virasoro algebra are given as functions of
a single free parameter :
 (^k,k' _k+k' )^2  &=& (k+k'+1)(N-k+1)
 (N-k'+1) (k+1)(k'+1)(N-k-k'+1)(N+1) 

 && (k+k'+v)(N+v-k)(N+v-k')(v) 
 (N+v-k-k')(k+v)(k'+v)(N+v) ,  

 c &=& 4(N-1)(N+v-1)v (N+2v)(N+2v-2) . Changing the parametrisation , the connection between
Eq. () and the coset formula () becomes explicit.

Among the representation fields, primaries with respect to the algebra
()-(), we expect to find singlet operators
 ^0 (z,z ) with  charge equal to , and doublet  operators
 ^q (z,z ), q=1,2,,N-1 2 , with  charge equal to . The singlet and doublet operators
()-() form the usual representations of the group
.

In fact, the theory we are considering is invariant under the dihedral group
, which includes  as a subgroup. This can be seen from the
symmetry of Eqs. ()-() under conjugation of the 
charge, , cf. Eq. (). The representation space should
thus include also the -plet of  disorder operators, which we denote
as:
 R_a(z,z ),a=1,,N.
The presence of disorder operators in the spectrum has been shown explicitly
in the case of the first solution for general , and in the case
of the second solution for the theories with  and 
.

The disorder fields thus play a symmetry generating role, since they complete
the cyclic group , generated by the parafermionic currents 
, to the dihedral group . However, the disorder fields are
non-chiral representation fields, and in particular they do not participate in
the chiral algebra. The chiral algebra is therefore based on the
abelian  group .

Until now we have specified and discussed the operator content of the theory.
The next step is to study the degenerate representations of the algebra
()-(). It is indeed well established that for a given
chiral algebra with a free parameter, the associated conformal field theory is
described by the degenerate representations of that algebra.

In order to study the degenerate representations, we first have to analyse the
structure of the modules induced by various primary fields. In
Ref.  these modules were constructed for . We shall show
below how to generalise these results to arbitrary odd .

Singlet and doublet sectors 
Modules and mode commutation relations 

We start by considering the module of the identity. First of all we place the
chiral fields , with , and the
stress-energy tensor  in the module of the identity . The levels of
these operators correspond to their conformal dimensions . To
complete the module with the remaining levels it is sufficient to take into
account that, owing to the abelian monodromy of the fields , the
level spacing in each sector is equal to 1.

In the module of the identity there are no states below  and above
. This is not the case for a more general singlet operator
; the first descendent levels of the correspondent module are, at
least partially, occupied. Let us
denote by  the first descendent level in the  charge
sector .  From Eq. () we readily obtain that
 ^0 _k =-2k^2 N   mod   1. The knowledge of the gaps  completely fixes the level structure of
a generic singlet module. In the upper left part of Fig.  we show,
as an example, the module of a singlet operator for .

 
 
  fig1.eps  
  [3]Representation modules for . We show
 the level structure of the modules of a singlet (top left), a doublet 1
 (top right), a doublet 2 (bottom left), and a doublet 3 operator
 (bottom right). 

The structure of the doublet  modules is extracted from the module
of the identity by examining its corresponding submodules. The
generalisation to the doublet  module of Eq. () is:
 ^q _k =2(q^2-k^2) N 
  mod   1, where  is the first level in the module of the doublet 
corresponding to the  charge sector .  From now on we will make
extensive use of the above notation. In Fig. , the three possible
doublets for  are shown.

In accordance with the structure of the modules, the developments of the
chiral fields in each sector take, for general , the form:
 ^k (z)^q (0) &=&
 _n 1 (z)^_k -^q _k+q +n  
 A^k _-^q _k+q +n ^q (0),  

 A^k _-^q _k+q +n ^q (0) &=& 0, n>0. We remind that the sums  of the  charges are always defined modulo
. Eq. () is the usual highest weight condition which expresses
that representation fields are primary with respect to the
parafermionic algebra. As usual, from Eq. (), the action
of the modes in each sector can be given in the form of a contour integral:
 A^k _-^q _k+q +n ^q (0) = 1 2i _C_0  
 d z (z)^_k -^q _k+q +n-1 ^k (z)^q (0).
 Note that, by Eq. (), the level  is equal to
zero for . This results in the presence, for each doublet 
, of a zero mode  which acts between the two states at the
summit of the corresponding module:
 A^2q _0 ^q (0)=h_q ^q (0). The eigenvalues  defined by the above equation characterise the
representations, together with the conformal dimension of the fields
.

The commutation relations of the mode operators can be deduced from
Eq. () in a way similar to that used in Refs. .
Below we give the general form of these relations.

In what follows  we define  the coefficients  from
the development
 (1-x)^ =^ _l=0 D^l _ x^l .
By Eq. (), the modes of the parafermions 
and , where  with
, satisfy the relations:
 &&^ _l=0 D^l _  (
 A^k _-^k'+q _k+k'+q +s(k,k',q)+n-l 
 A^k' _-^q _k'+q +m+l -A^k' _-^k+q _k'+k+q +s(k',k,q)+m-l 
 A^k _-^q _k+q +n+l  ) ^q  

 &=&^k,k' _k+k' 
 ^(k,k',q) (n,m)A^k+k' _-^q _k+k'+q +t(k,k',q)+n+m ^q 
 (k+k'0) with
 &=& _k +_k' -_k+k'  -2 

 ^(k,k',q) (n,m) &=&
 _k -^q _k+q +n-1-_k+k' +
 _k -_k'  2_k+k'  
 (_k+k' -^q _k+k'+q +t(k,k',q)+n+m). In Eq. (), the integers  and 
shift the indices of the parafermionic modes. They are given by:
s(k,k',q)&=& ^k'+q _k+k'+q -^q _k+q +

t(k,k',q)&=&  ^q _k+k'+q -^q _k+q -^q _k'+q +The remaining commutation relations between the modes of the
parafermions   and  (with )
realise the connection with the Virasoro algebra. In fact, it is seen from
Eq. () that the stress-energy operator  is produced
in the expansion . Defining the integers 
as:
 u(k,q)= ^-k+q _q -^q _k+q +we can write the following relations:
 &&^ _l=0 D^l _  ( A^k _-^-k+q _q 
 +u(k,q)+n-l A^-k _-^q _-k+q +m+l +
 A^-k _-^k+q _q +u(-k,q)+m-l 
 A^k _-^q _k+q +n+l  ) ^q  

 &=&
 ((n)_n+m+u'(k,q),0 +2_k  c L_n+m+u'(k,q) 
 )^q with
 &=& 2_k -3   

 (n)&=&1 2 (_k -^q _k+q 
 +n-1)(_k -^q _k+q  +n-2). On the right-hand side of Eq. () we have defined
 for , and  for .

In Eq. (), the  are the generators of the conformal
transformations which form the Virasoro algebra:
 (L_n L_m -L_m L_n )^q =
 [(n-m)L_n+m +c 12 n(n^2 -1)_n+m,0 ]^q .
 Finally, the list of commutation relations in the singlet and doublet sectors
are completed by the commutators between the
parafermionic modes  and the :
 (A^k _-^q _k+q +m L_n -L_n A^k _-^q _k+q +m )
 ^q = [ (1-_^k  )n+m-^q _k+q  ]
 A^k _-^q _k+q +m+n ^q . We shall often refer to Eq. () using the shorthand notation
; likewise, Eq. () is referred
to as .
The commutation relations ()-() given above allow to
compute various matrix elements which enter the analysis of the degeneracies
in the modules, to which we now turn our attention.

In Ref. , where the case  was considered, the
dimensions of all the fundamental operators, i.e., the fundamental
singlet, doublet 1, doublet 2 and disorder operators, were calculated
by imposing the degeneracy at the first levels of the corresponding
modules.

Below we present the analysis for the degeneracies at the first levels of the
singlet and of the doublet  operators for . In the case of the doublet
 and of the disorder operator  we have been able to treat the case
of arbitrary odd . In the next Section we shall show that the results of
this analysis, together with the properties of the Coulomb gas, will allow us
to construct the theory completely.

Identity operator 

In the following we shall call a degenerate operator fundamental  if its
levels of degeneracy are the lowest possible. It is natural to expect that
the fundamental singlet operator is the identity operator of the theory,
with dimension . Despite of this trivial value of
the scaling dimension, it is important to analyse the module of the identity
operator properly. Namely, the levels and  charges of its degenerate
submodules, and their multiplicities, provide important information that
we shall use in Section 3 to dress the general theory. This analysis was
done for  in Ref. ; we here extend it to .

In the module of a singlet operator, shown in the top left part of
Fig. , the first descendent level is the level  in the 
sector. By using the commutation relations  and
 (cf. Eq. ()) it is easy to
verify that all the possible  states at level  are proportional
to one another
 A^1_3/7  A^2_-6/7  ^0 A^-2 _3/7  A^-2 _-6/7  ^0  A^2_2/7  A^1_-5/7  ^0 A^-3 _2/7  A^-1 _-5/7  ^0  A^-1 _0  A^-3 _-3/7  ^0 A^3 _-3/7 ^0 .
 The above relations imply that there is only one  state at level .
Thus, in order to impose degeneracy at level , we must require
that the state
 ^3_-3/7  = A^3_-3/7  ^0 
be primary. This amounts to the condition:
 A^-3 _+3/7  A^3_-3/7  ^0 = 0. 
 Using  (cf. Eq. ()), it turns out that
the constraint () is equivalent to the following relation
between certain matrix elements at lower levels
(Eq. () expresses just one of many equivalent
ways of transcribing the constraint () in terms of
relations between lower-lying matrix elements. Using the decompositions
() it may be seen that among the various choices of rewriting
the constraint (), the one that digs least deeply into
the module involves matrix elements up to level . In any case, the key
point is that the matrix elements occuring in any such relation touch lower
levels than those that we degenerate in the present calculation.) :
 ( A^3_+24/7  A^-3 _-24/7 -27 7   
 A^3_+17/7  A^-3 _-17/7 +270 49  A^3_+10/7 
 A^-3 _-10/7  ) ^0 =
 (1+48 7c _^0 )^0.
 Having imposed the constraint ()-or equivalently
the relation ()-we can eliminate the only state
at level . We thus set
 A^3_-3/7  ^0 = 0 . 
 We then consider the next available level  in the  charge sector. 
Once the level  is empty, there are three main ways of descending to
this level:
 A^1 _-5/7 ^0, A^2 _0  A^-1 _-5/7  ^0, A^-1 _+1/7  A^2 _-6/7 ^0.
 However, among the above states  only two are independent. This is  
seen from the commutation relation 
from which it follows that
 A^2 _0  A^-1 _-5/7  ^0 - A^-1 _+1/7  A^2 _-6/7 ^0 =
 ^2,-1 _1  6   A^1 _-5/7 ^0.
In addition to the states (), we have to consider also the
states which are obtained by repeated application of the parafermionic zero
modes, like for example the state 
. By using the commutation relations () and the condition
(), we have checked that all these states actually
decompose into linear combinations of the states (). To see
this, it is sufficent to verify that
 A^2 _0  A^-2 _0  A^1 _-5/7  ^0 = a  A^1 _-5/7 ^0 +
 b A^2 _0  A^-1 _-5/7  ^0,
 where  and  are some numerical coefficients.
  
Each state at level  in the  sector can thus be written in terms
of the states  and . Then,
if we demand the complete degeneracy at level , we have to impose the
following conditions:
 A^-1 _+5/7  ( A^1 _-5/7 ^0 ) &=& 0,  

 A^1 _+5/7  A^-2 _0  ( A^1 _-5/7 ^0 ) &=& 0,
  

 A^-1 _+5/7  ( A^2 _0  A^-1 _-5/7 ^0 ) &=& 0,
  
  
 A^1 _+5/7 A^-2 _0  ( A^2 _0  A^-1 _-5/7 ^0 ) &=& 0.
  
Using the charge conjugation symmetry, and Eq. (), it is
easy to see that if the conditions ()-() are
verified, the remaining equations ()-()
are automatically satisfied. Once the conditions
()-() have been imposed, all the states at
level  can then be eliminated.

 From the commutation relation  we have that

 A^-1 _+5/7 A^1 _-5/7 ^0 = 48 7c  _^0  ^0.
The condition () then implies that
 _^0  = 0.
We have thus found the trivial scaling dimension of the identity.

  
The second equation () simply determines the values of some
matrix elements, starting from the value of the matrix element 
 which is set equal to zero. By using the
algebra of the parafermionic modes, other matrix elements can then be fixed.
For example, from the condition () and the commutation
relations  and , it
turns out that
 A^1 _+5/7 
 A^-2 _0  A^1 _-5/7 ^0 = ^1,1 _2 A^-2 _+6/7 
 A^2 _-6/7 ^0 =0. 
Once all the states at level  and at level  have been eliminated, it
can easily be shown that the level  is automatically empty. In fact,
according to the commutation relation , the only
possible state  at level  vanishes, since
 ^1,1 _2 A^2_-6/7 ^0= A^1_-1/7 A^1_-5/7 ^0 = 0.
Summarising, we see that the fundamental singlet has one degenerate doublet 3
submodule at level  and two degenerate doublet 1 submodules at level
.

Fundamental doublet 1 operator 

We here show how to extend the explicit degeneracy analysis of the fundamental
doublet 1 operator from the case  (see Ref. ) to .

The first descendent states in this doublet (shown in the upper right
part of Fig. ) are the two conjugate doublet 2 states at
level . We first impose complete degeneracy of these states; by
charge conjugation symmetry it suffices to study the one with .
The degeneracy condition reads
 A^-1 _1/7  A^1_-1/7  ^1 = 0.
By the commutation relations , this determines
a matrix element at level :
 _1,-1  ^1 A^1_2/7  A^-1 _-2/7  ^1 =
 ( -6 49 +24 7c  _^1  ) ^1,
where  is the conformal weight of the doublet
1 operator that were are trying to determine.

We then focus on the next available level, which is the singlet ()
state at level . Since there are no states left on level ,
our candidate for a singular state at level  reads
 ^0_-2/7  = a A^1_-2/7  ^-1  + b A^-1 _-2/7  ^1.
The degeneracy conditions are .
Using the charge conjugation symmetry, they can be summarised by
 ( _1,1  )^2 = ( _1,-1  )^2, where the matrix element  is defined by
 _1,1  ^1 A^1_2/7  A^1_-2/7  ^-1  and  has been given above.
Using  we can evaluate
 _1,1  = ^1,1 _2 h_2,
where the structure constant  is given by
Eq. (), and the zero mode eigenvalue  is
defined in Eq. ().

It would now appear natural to impose the third (and last) degeneracy
condition on the doublet 3 states at level . But we shall now show
that this level is actually void, as a result of the degeneracies at
levels  and . Let us recall that there is by now zero states
at level , and one state at level  since we have set
 ^0_-2/7  = A^1_-2/7  ^-1  - A^-1 _-2/7  ^1 0.
The potential states at level  in, say, the charge  sector
therefore read:
 A^2_-5/7  ^1,  A^-3 _-5/7  ^-1 ,  A^3_-3/7  A^1 _-2/7  ^-1 . The first of these states is zero as a consequence of the degeneracy
at level , and of the commutation relations 
which imply
 A^1_-4/7  A^1_-1/7  ^1 = 12 ^1,1 _2 A^2_-5/7  ^1.
By charge conjugation we also have . But the
commutation relations  imply that
 A^-1 _0 A^-2 _-5/7  ^-1  = 23 ^1,2 _3
 A^-3 _-5/7  ^-1 ,
and we must therefore have  as well.
Finally, it is a consequence of  that
 ( A^1_-4/7  A^3_-1/7  - A^3_-3/7  A^1_-2/7  ) ^-1  =
 -14 ^1,3 _-3  A^-3 _-5/7  ^-1 .
We have shown that the first term on the left-hand side vanishes, as does
the term on the right-hand side. Therefore
 must also vanish. In conclusion, we
have shown that all of the three states () are zero,
and thus level  is empty.

We therefore try imposing degeneracy on the doublet 1 states at level 1.
For definiteness, we consider the charge sector . There are
potentially three states at this position in the module:
 A^2_-1  ^-1 ,  A^1_-5/7  A^1_-2/7  ^-1 ,  L_-1  ^1. However, the first of these two states are dependent, as is seen by
using the commutation relations :
 A^1_-5/7  A^1_-2/7  ^-1  = 12 ^1,1 _2 A^2_-1  ^-1 .
It turns out to be most convenient to use this dependency to eliminate
the first of the states (). We therefore demand that
 ^1_-1  = a  L_-1  ^1 +
 b  A^1_-5/7  A^1_-2/7  ^-1 
be a singular state. Defining four matrix elements
 _0 ^1 && L_1 L_-1  ^1,  

 _1 ^1 && L_1 A^1_-5/7  A^1_-2/7  ^-1 , 

 _2 ( A^1_-2/7  ^-1  ) &&
 A^-1 _5/7  L_-1  ^1,  

 _3 ( A^1_-2/7  ^-1  ) &&
 A^-1 _5/7  A^1_-5/7  A^1_-2/7  ^-1 , the degeneracy criterion can be cast in the form
 _0 _3 - _1 _2 = 0. The first three of the matrix elements ()-()
are easily found from the commutation relations
()-(). The results are:
 _0 = 2 _^1 ,  _1 = 10 7  _1,1 ,  _2 = 10 7 , where  is defined by Eq. (). The evaluation of
the fourth matrix element is slightly more involved. Letting the commutation
relation  act on the state
 we obtain
 ( A^-1 _5/7  A^1_-5/7  - 37 A^-1 _-2/7  A^1_2/7 
 + A^1_-2/7  A^-1 _2/7  ) A^1_-2/7  ^-1  =
 24 7c  L_0 ( A^1_-2/7  ^-1  ).
This implies that
 _3 = 37 _1,1  - _1,-1  + 24 7c 
 ( _^1  + 27 ). The solution of Eq. (), with the ingredients
() and (), depends on the sign chosen in
resolving Eq. (). Choosing ,
we find the solutions
 ^() _^1  =
 1 42  ( 36 - c (c-6)(c-216)  ). 
 On the other hand, the choice  leads to
 _^1  = 1 84  ( 128 + 5c  25 c^2 + 680 c + 16384  ). 
 We shall see below that the solutions () are physically
acceptable, from the point of view of the general structure of the theory
that we are constructing, while () must be discarded as
non-physical. It is useful to rewrite Eq. ()
in terms of the parametrisation ():
 _^1 ^(+) &=& 5 7  p+7 p ,  

 _^1 ^(-) &=& 5 7  p-5 p+2 . In summary, the fundamental doublet 1 operator has one degenerate doublet 2
submodule at level , one degenerate singlet submodule at level ,
and one degenerate doublet 1 submodule at level .

Fundamental doublet  operator 

Writing , the doublet with the largest possible  charge is the
doublet . The fact that the module of the doublet  has its two summits
in adjacent charge sectors is a help in the degeneracy computations. For this
reason, we have been able to treat the case of arbitrary odd .

We begin by considering the case of  in some detail. In this case,
the structure of the doublet  is shown in the lower right part of
Fig. . Using the commutation relations, it is easy to see
that all the ways of descending to level  in the charge sector
 are in fact linearly dependent:
 A^3_-2/7  ^3 A^1_1/7  A^2_-3/7  ^3  A^-3 _1/7  A^-1 _-3/7  ^3 A^-2 _0 A^-2 _-2/7  ^3
 A^1_1/7  A^1_-3/7  ^-3  A^2_-2/7  ^-3 .
In particular, there is only one  state at level .
Imposing degeneracy of this state amounts to the condition
 A^-2 _2/7  A^2_-2/7  ^-3  = 0. This condition does not immediately lead to a fixation of the zero
mode eigenvalue . Rather, it gives relations between certain matrix
elements deeper down in the module. The reason is essentially that
the commutation relations  have a
high value of the parameter , cf. Eq. (), and thus
several terms will contribute on the left-hand side. (We have already
encountered a similar phenomenon in Eq. ().)

The next available level consists of the doublet 2 states at level .
Due to the degeneracy (), level  is now empty, and there
are a priori two states in the sector  at level :
 A^2_-3/7  ^3 and  A^1_-3/7  ^-3 .

These states are however dependent, as is seen from
. (Further candidate states obtained by acting
by the zero mode at level  can be similarly eliminated.)
The degeneracy criterion reads
 A^-1 _3/7  A^1_-3/7  ^-3  = 0. By , this immediately fixes the zero
mode eigenvalue:
 ( h_3 )^2 = -5 49  + 24 7c  _^3 .
 As a consequence of  we have that
 _3^1,2  A^3_-4/7  ^-3  =
 A^1_-2/7  A^2_-2/7  ^-3  = -32 A^2_-1/7  A^1_-3/7  ^-3 .
Thus, since levels  and  are now empty, there are no states
left at level .

With these simplifications, the next available states are in the 
sectors at level . Focusing on , the case of  being equivalent,
we form the candidate singular state
 ^3_-1  = a L_-1  ^3 + b A^-1 _-1  ^-3 , and we define the matrix elements
 _0,0   ^3    &=& L_1 L_-1  ^3, 

 _0,-1  ^3    &=& L_1 A^-1 _-1  ^-3 , 

 _1,0   ^-3  &=& A^1_1 L_-1  ^3, 

 _1,-1  ^-3  &=& A^1_1 A^-1 _-1  ^-3 .
The degeneracy criterion then reads, as usual,
 _0,0  _1,-1  - _0,-1  _1,0  = 0. The first three matrix elements are readily computed
 _0,0  = 2 _^3 ,  _0,-1  = _1,0  = 12 7  h_3,
and the fourth one is obtained from ,
yielding
 _1,-1  = 37 ( h_3 )^2 + 9 49  +
 24 7c  _^3 .
Inserting this into Eq. (), and using also
Eq. () for the zero mode eigenvalue, we arrive at the
solution
 ^() _^3  =
 1 70  ( 36 - c (c-6)(c-216)  ).
 This can also be written, using the parametrisation (), as:
 ^(+) _^3  &=& 37 p+7 p , 

 ^(-) _^3  &=& 37 p-5 p+2 .
In conclusion, the doublet 3 module that we have constructed has one
degenerate doublet 1 submodule at level , one degenerate doublet 2
submodule at level , and one degenerate doublet 3 submodule at level 1.

General case:  Based on the similarities of the fundamental
doublet  modules for  (see Ref. ) and
 (see above), we can conjecture the structure of this doublet in
the general case. One should demand the existence of  distinct
degenerate submodules; however, only two degeneracy conditions are
required to fix the zero mode eigenvalue  and the dimension
. We conjecture that these two conditions are obtained
by requiring, respectively:
 
 The complete degeneracy of the doublet  state
 at level  (see Eq. ()).
 Note that we have here supposed that those of the remaining  degeneracy
 conditions that act at levels strictly between  and  are
 such that these levels become empty after factoring out the corresponding
 degenerate submodules (or at least that no indirect ways of descending
 to level  exist). Under this assumption, there remains
 only the two direct ways of descending to level :
   A^-1 _-^r_r-1   ^r  and    A^-2 _-_r-1 ^r   ^-r .   However, the commutation relation 
 of Eq. (), with  and , shows that these two states
 are in fact proportional to one another.
 In order to have degeneracy at level , it thus suffices
 to require that the state
   ^r-1 _-_r-1 ^r  A^-1 _-_r-1 ^r  ^r 
    be primary. This condition then fixes the eigenvalue  (see below).
 A degeneracy of the doublet  state at level 1. We here suppose
 that those of the remaining  degeneracy conditions that act at levels
 strictly between  and 1 are such that these levels become
 empty after factoring out the corresponding degenerate submodules.
 If this is so, we can produce a degenerate state of a form
 analogous to Eq. ()
   ^r _-1 =a L_-1 ^r +bA^-1 _-1 ^-r .   Demanding the primarity of this state then fixes
  (see below). 
Note that apart from eliminating unwanted states between levels 0 and 1,
the remaining  degeneracy conditions may fix the values of certain
lower-lying matrix elements (as was the case for , at level ).

We have verified that the scenario outlined above indeed holds
true also for . Now, let us examine its algebraic consequences
in the general case.

The primarity of the state () can be obtained by requiring
that
 A^1 _+_r-1 ^r  A^-1 _-_r-1 ^r  ^r =0.
This can be rewritten, using the commutation relations
, through
 ( A^-1 _0 A^1 _0 +A^-1 __r-1 ^r  
 A^1 _-_r-1 ^r   ) ^r  =
 ( -N-2 N^2 +2_1  c _^r   )
 ^r ,
which fixes the eigenvalue () to be:
 ( h_r  )^2 =
 -N-2 N^2 +2_1  c _^r  ,
 thus generalising Eq. (). If we impose
the condition (), then the state () can be set
equal to zero, thus reducing the module. With the above set of assumptions,
there are no states left in the module strictly between levels 0 and 1.

Turning now to level 1, we demand that the state () be
primary:
 L_+1 ^r _-1 =0,A^+1 _+1 ^r _-1 =0.
In terms of the matrix elements  defined by
 L_+1 L_-1 ^r  &=&_11 ^r , 

 L_+1 A_-1 ^-1 ^-r  &=& _12 ^r , 

 A_-1 ^-1 L_-1 ^-r  &=& _21 ^r , 

 A_+1 ^-1 A_-1 ^1 ^r  &=& _22 ^r ,
the degeneracy criterion reads
 _11 _22 -_12 _21 =0. Using the commutation relations, the required 
matrix elements are readily computed:
 _11  &=& 2_^r  , 

 _12  = _21  &=& _1 h_r , 

 _22  &=& N-4 N (h_r )^2 +N+2 N^2 +2_1  
 c _^r  ,Inserting the eigenvalue () and the matrix elements
()-() into Eq. () we get the following
solutions:
 ^() _^r   = 1 2 +1-c 2N(N-2)   1 2N(N-2) (c-N+1)(c-(N-1)^3) ,which generalise Eq. ().

Using the parametrisation () 
in Eq. (), these solutions take the form
 ^(+) _^r  &=&1 2 (N-1)(N+p) Np ,  

 ^(-) _^r  &=&1 2 (N-1)(p+2-N) (p+2)N .
 It should be remarked that the assumptions that we have made in order to
determine the dimension  for general  will ultimately
be validated by the agreement of Eqs. ()-() with
the Kac formula which we shall discuss in the next Section.

Sector of the disorder operators  
Modes of the chiral operators and commutation relations 

The theory of disorder operators  () has been
fully developed in Ref.  within the first parafermionic
conformal field theory with symmetry , and in Refs. within the context of the second parafermionic theory with
symmetries  and  respectively. The general properties
(operator product expansions, analytic continuations, etc.) of the disorder
sector operators, and the approach used for studying this particular sector,
can be adapted to the present theory as well.

The non-abelian monodromy of the disorder operator

 with respect to the chiral
 fields  amounts to the decomposition of
 the local products 
 into half-integer powers of :
  ^k (z)R_a (0) =
 _n 1 (z)^_k +n 2   
 A^k _n 2  R_a (0), k=1,2,,N-1 2 . The expansion of the product
 (with ) can be obtained by
an analytic continuation of  around 0 on both sides of
Eq. (). The result is:
 ^-k (z)R_a (0) = _n (-1)^n  (z)^_k +n 2   
 A^1 _n 2    U ^k R_a (0),  k=1,2,,N-1 2 .
In the above equation,  is a  matrix which
rotates the index of the disorder field: 
.

In accordance with these expansions, the mode operators
 can be defined by the contour integrals
 A^k _n 2  R_a (0)=1 4i _C_0  
 d z  (z)^_k +n 2 -1 ^k (z)R_a (0),
where the integrations are defined by letting  turn twice
around the operator  at the origin, exactly as
described in Ref. .

In the calculations of degeneracy we have used two types of
commutation relations: The first one is between the modes of
two  chiral fields,
 && ^ _l=0  D^l _  (
 A^1 _n-l 2  A^1 _m+l 2   +
 A^1 _m-l 2  A^1 _n+l 2   ) R_a  

 &=& ^1,1 _2  2^_2 -3 A^2 _n+m 2  R_a +
 (-1)^n  2^-_2 -2  [ (n)_n+m,0  +
 16_1  c 
 L_n+m 2   ] U ^-1 R_a , and the second one is between the  and  chiral
fields, with ,
 && ^ _l=0  D^l _  (
 A^k _n-l 2  A^1 _m+l 2  -A^1 _m-l 2  
 A^k _n+l 2   ) R_a   

 &=& (-1)^n+m  2^k,1 _k+1 
 [(2_k +n-1)-2 -a_1 
 (2_k+1 +n+m) ]A^k+1 _n+m 2  R_a  

 &+& (-1)^m  2^-k,1 _1-k 
 [(2_k +n-1)-2 -a_2 (2_1-k +n+m)
 ] A^1-k _n+m 2   U ^k  R_a , 
where the coefficients  are defined by
 (1-x)^ (1+x)^ =^ _l=0 D^l _ x^l .
In Eq. () we have used the following abbreviations:
 &=& 2_1 -_2 -1, 

 &=& 2_1 -3, 

 (n)&=& (2_1 +n-1)(2_1 +n-2)-(2_1 +n-1)
 (_2 +1)+(_2 +1)(_2 +2) 4 . And in Eq. () we have abbreviated the following quantities:
 &=& _k +_1 -_k+1 -2, 

 &=& _-k +_1 -_1-k -2, 

 a_1 &=&_k+1 +_k -_1  2_k+1  , 

 a_2 &=&_1-k +_k -_1  2_1-k  . Degeneracy of the disorder modules 

The structure of the module of a disorder operator  () is
relatively simple, as witnessed by the expansion (): Each module
has  summits, labeled by the components , and has only integer and
half-integer levels. Furthermore, it is seen from the expansion ()
that there are  zero modes  (with
), associated with the parafermion  which
acts between the  summits of the module:
 A^k _0 R_a  = h_k   U ^2k R_a . This defines the eigenvalues . We recall that .
Like in the case of the doublet operators, the eigenvalues 
characterise, together with the conformal dimension, each representation
. Actually, the eigenvalues  and  are linked by a relation
which does not depend on the details of the representation . This
relation is easily obtained by setting  in Eq. ():
 2h_1^2=^1,1 _2  2^_2 -3 h_2+ 2^-_2 -2 
 [ (0)+16_1  c  _R ].
We conclude then that each representation  is characterised by
its dimension  and  eigenvalues .
These values are fixed by studying the degenerate representations of
the disorder sector. We shall show an example below.

The first descendants for a
given primary operator  are found at level 1/2. For a given
value of the index  there are  states:
 ( ^(k) _a  )_-1 2   =
 A^k _-1 2   U ^-2k R_a  =
 U ^-2k  A^k _-1 2  R_a ,
 k=1,2,,N-1 2 . In the case of , there are two states,
 and
, in Eq. ().
In Ref. , these were both required to be primary, and this choice
was shown to be consistent with the properties of the fundamental
disorder operator in a Coulomb gas construction based on the algebra .
The most natural generalisation for  is to impose that all of the states
() be primary. The corresponding solutions give the dimensions of
the fundamental disorder operators, with the  required degeneracies
all situated at the first descendant level .

We therefore impose that
  A^k' _+1 2  (^(k) _a )_-1 2  =0 for each , and for each
.  Using the commutation relations
()-(), the degeneracy condition
() results in a system of  independent
equations which allow to determine the  unknown variables,
i.e., the  independent eigenvalues  and the conformal
dimension  of the disorder operator .  (We omit
here all the algebraic manipulations since this computation is
strictly analogous to the one presented in detail in
Ref. .)

Among the solutions for the conformal dimensions  admitted by this
system of  equations, only two are physical solutions, in the sense
that they are consistent with the Kac formula which will be given in the next
Section. The two physical solutions for  read:
 ^(1) _R   = 1 16 (N-1)(p+N) p ,  ^(2) _R  = 1 16 (N-1)(p+2-N) p+2 . Kac formula and boundary terms 

Lie algebra structure 

It has already been observed in the Introduction that the central charge of the
second parafermionic theory with  symmetry agrees with that of a coset
based on the group . It is therefore natural to suppose some connection
with the Lie algebra , when  is odd. In the case  this
connection was made explicit in Ref. , by assuming the existence
of a Coulomb gas realisation of the theory, based on the algebra .
We shall here generalise this construction to arbitrary .

Each primary operator  of the theory is assumed to be represented by
a vertex operator, which can in turn be associated with the
weight lattice of  as follows:
   _(n_1 ,,n_r )(n'_1 ,,n'_r ) =
 _i=1 ^r  ( 1+n_i  2 _+  +
 1+n'_i  2 _-  )  _i . Here,  are the fundamental weights of the algebra ,
and  are the usual Coulomb gas parameters. Their form
 _+  = p+2 p  ,_- =-p p+2  
 are immediately suggested by Eq. () for the central charge.

We shall use the notation
 to represent
the operator associated with
.
Note that the integers
 are essentially the Dynkin
labels of the weight . As usually in the Coulomb gas
construction the labels are doubled, with  representing
the  side of the theory, and  the
 side. The nature of a primary operator
, i.e., its
transformation properties under , remains unchanged if the
 and  sides are interchanged.
Actually, such properties only depend on the differences .
In most of what follows we shall therefore choose to trivialise the
 side, by setting .


The Coulomb gas formula for the conformal dimension of the primary operator
 reads
 _(n_1 ,,n_r )(n'_1 ,,n'_r )  _(n_1 ,,n_r )(n'_1 ,,n'_r ) ^(0) +B=
   (  -2 _0  )+B,
 where the background charge  is given by
  _0  = ( _+ +_-  2  )
 _i=1 ^r   _r .
In Eq. () we have written the scaling dimension as a sum
of two terms,  and
. The Coulomb term 

depends on the parameters  and ,
while the boundary term   is a constant that characterises the sector
of the representation space to which the operator under consideration belongs.

Note that the identity operator is
. Since
 and  is a singlet, we must necessarily have  for
any singlet operator. However, we still need to find the correct values
of  for the doublet  and for the disorder sectors. These values,
and their assignment to the different positions of the weight lattice,
are arguably the main interest of the theory that we are constructing.

We shall refer to Eq. () as the Kac formula of the theory.
The table of operators ,
which is associated with the lattice made by the vectors
,
shall be called the Kac table of the theory.

To use Eq. () to calculate actual values of the dimensions,
we need the
scalar products  for the Lie
algebra , which are encoded in the quadratic form matrix:
  _i   _j =ifor ij < r;   _i   _r =i 2 for i<r;
   _r   _r =r 4 . In what follows, a major role is played by the action of Weyl reflections
on the weights. We recall that the Weyl group  is generated by 
simple reflections  , with ,
acting as follows on the vertex operators (weights):
 s_e _i   _(1,,1)(n'_1,,n'_r)  =
  _(1,,1)(n'_1,,n'_r)  + n'_i _- e _i.
Here,  are the Lie algebra's simple roots,
whose coordinates in the basis of fundamental weights can be read off
from the rows of the Cartan matrix.
The total number of Weyl reflections is . We also recall
that the Weyl group possesses a unique longest element, which can
be written as a word of length  in terms of the generators
. This longest element simply changes the sign of
all the labels .

In the context of the conformal field theory,
the physical significance of the Weyl group is linked to the fact that the
simple roots represent the screenings operators of the Coulomb gas
realisation. As usual, we assume that the screenings commute
with the parafermionic algebra.

Given a generic vertex operator, there exists exactly one Weyl
reflection that maps it into the fundamental Weyl chamber,
the physical domain of the Kac table.










Like in Felder's resolution for minimal models, the
simple Weyl reflections indicate singular states (degeneracies) in
the modules of physical operators. More precisely, a simple
reflection can be associated with a mapping (realised by integrated
screenings) that takes a vertex operator outside the physical domain of the
Kac table into the module of a physical vertex operator. The difference between
the dimensions of these two operators, computed from Eq. ()
with the appropriate boundary terms, gives the level of degeneracy.
It is in the sense of this mapping that the
operator outside the physical domain is associated with a
non-physical (singular) state in the module of the physical operator; for this
reason it could be called a ghost operator .  The nature (singlet,
doublet , disorder) of the corresponding singular state must
coincide with the labeling of the ghost operator. In a similar
fashion, non-simple reflections can be used to infer the fine
structure of the degenerate modules (ghosts within ghosts, etc.). For
instance, this aspect has been studied in a certain detail, in the case
of the representations of the  algebra,
in the paper, and references therein.

Disorder sector 

We shall first consider the problem of the boundary term
for the disorder sector, and of the position of the fundamental
disorder operators.

The boundary term  for this sector is readily accessible,
since we have computed explicitly the conformal dimensions of the
fundamental disorder operators () by means of
degeneracy conditions. Indeed, once we have identified the position
on the weight lattice of these operators by the coefficients of
 and , we may read off the boundary terms
from the  independent terms in the formulae for the
dimensions.

Having done some algebric manipulation, it is easy to verify-by
using the scalar products () and Eq. ()
in the Kac formula ()-that the dimensions () of the
fundamental disorder operators correspond, respectively, to
 _(1,,1,2)(1,,1)   and  
 _(1,,1)(1,,1,2) 
 with the boundary term
 B_R = N-1 32 . Doublet sectors,  

Identifying the boundary terms  of the doublet  sector is
more complicated. Indeed, we have not been able to explicitly compute
the dimensions of the fundamental doublet operators for general .
However, in Section 2 we have obtained such explicit results for the
case of  (), at least for the doublet 1 and doublet 3 sectors.
Before turning to the general case, let us see how the  case can
be completed by exploiting properties of the Coulomb gas representation.

Our explicit results for the dimensions of the fundamental doublet 
operators, see Eqs. ()-(), correspond respectively
to:
 _(1,2,1)(1,1,1)   and  
 _(1,1,1)(1,2,1)  with the boundary term
 B_D^1 = 3 14 . Simarly, the dimensions of the fundamental doublet 
operators, see Eqs. ()-(), are given by:
 _(2,1,1)(1,1,1)   and  
 _(1,1,1)(2,1,1) ,
with the boundary term
 B_D^3 = 5 28 . To determine the remaining boundary term , for whose fundamental
operator we have no explicit degeneracy computation, we shall use an
argument based on Weyl reflections, as discussed in Section .
To this end we consider the fundamental
doublet  operator , whose position was determined
in Eq. () above. In this case the three principal reflections
are:
 s_e _1   _(1,1,1)(-1,3,1)  =
  _(1,1,1)(1,2,1)  &=&  _(1,1,1)(-1,3,1)  +
 _- e _1 , 

 s_e _2   _(1,1,1)(3,-2,5)  =
  _(1,1,1)(1,2,1)  &=&  _(1,1,1)(3,-2,5)  +
 2 _- e _2 , 

 s_e _3   _(1,1,1)(1,3,-1)  =
  _(1,1,1)(1,2,1)  &=&  _(1,1,1)(1,3,-1)  +
 _- e _3 . (In this expression, and in the following, the reflections are understood
to act on the  side of the indices only.)
These reflections give the following differences of the Coulomb part of
the dimensions:
 ^(0) _(1,1,1)(-1,3,1) -^(0) _(1,1,1)(1,2,1) &=&1 2 ,
 

 ^(0) _(1,1,1)(3,-2,5) -^(0) _(1,1,1)(1,2,1) &=&1, 

 ^(0) _(1,1,1)(1,3,-1) -^(0) _(1,1,1)(1,2,1) &=&1 4 .
 In the above equations we have to add the correct boundary terms
in order to obtain the level of degeneracy on the right-hand side.
This amounts to determining to which sector the ghost operator belongs.
The important point is that the labeling of the ghost operator has to
coincide with the nature of the corresponding state in the module of the
doublet . In Section 2 we have seen that the module of
the operator  contains three singular states: A
doublet  state at level , a singlet state at level , and a
doublet  state at level . It is then easy to verify,
using Eqs. (), (), and
()-(), that there is only one correct way
of labeling the ghost operators:
 _(1,1,1)(-1,3,1)  && S,   

 _(1,1,1)(3,-2,5)  && D^1, 

 _(1,1,1)(1,3,-1)  && D^2. The boundary term  is then fixed by the condition
 ^(0) _(1,1,1)(1,3,-1) +B_D^2 -
 ^(0) _(1,1,1)(1,2,1) -B_D^1 =1 7 ,
which, using Eqs. () and (), yields:
 B_D^2 =3 28 . Using the same kind of reasoning, we can also determine the nature of the
operator . The principal reflections are:
 s_e _1   _(1,1,1)(-1,2,3)  =
  _(1,1,1)(1,1,3)  &=&  _(1,1,1)(-1,2,3)  +
 _- e _1  

 s_e _2   _(1,1,1)(2,-1,5)  =
  _(1,1,1)(1,1,3)  &=&  _(1,1,1)(2,-1,5)  +
 _- e _2  

 s_e _3   _(1,1,1)(1,4,-3)  =
  _(1,1,1)(1,1,3)  &=&  _(1,1,1)(1,4,-3)  +
 3 _- e _3 .
Examining the differences of dimensions as before, one easily checks that
the only acceptable configuration is:
 _(1,1,1)(1,1,3)  && D^2, 

 _(1,1,1)(-1,2,3)  _(1,1,1)(2,-1,5)  && D^3, 

 _(1,1,1)(1,4,-3)  && D^1. We infer from the above analysis that the module of the doublet 
operator  has two singular doublet  states at
level  and one singular doublet  state at level .
Moverover, the operator  must be the
fundamental  doublet 2 operator, since these singular states are
situated at the lowest possible levels.

In summary, we have shown how to determine the boundary term  by
exploiting the reflections on the weight lattice together with some partial
explicit results for the dimension of fundamental operators.


Unitary theories. Finite Kac table 

All the considerations  done so far on the Kac table are valid for
general values of  and .
As usual, the Kac table becomes finite when
 takes rational values. The unitary
theories correspond to  taking integer values, according to the
coset realisation ()-().

The finiteness of the Kac table can be shown by considering the reflections
with respect to the hyperplane defined by
 n'_1 +2_i=2 ^r-1 n'_i +n'_r =p+2 on the  side, and by
 n_1 +2_i=2 ^r-1 n_i +n_r =p on the  side.
Geometrically, this hyperplane is perpendicular to the following
combination of screenings:
 e _1+2_i=2 ^r  e _i.
Note that the differences between the dimensions of the operators linked by
such reflections are in agreement with the levels of the corresponding
modules. The operators above the hyperplane () are expected to
be ghost operators and decouple from the theory.
For  integer, the physical part of the Kac table is therefore 
delimited by:
 2(r-1) && n'_1 +2_i=2 ^r-1 n'_i +n'_r p+1, 

 2(r-1) && n_1 +2_i=2 ^r-1 n_i +n_r p-1. The finite Kac table defined by Eq. () contains an extra symmetry.
It is easy to verify that the Coulomb part of the conformal dimension
 in
Eq. (), i.e., with the boundary term  being neglected, is
invariant under the operation
 n'_1 p+2-n'_1 -2_i=2 ^r-1 n'_i -n'_r ,&&
 n'_i n'_i  i=2,3,,r 

 n_1 p-n_1 -2_i=2 ^r-1 n_i -n_r ,&&
 n_i n_i  i=2,3,,r.Now, if the label of each operator (singlet, doublet , or disorder)
is invariant under (), the above reflection will stay a
symmetry when the boundary term is included. We shall see in Section 4
below that the correct labeling indeed has this property. Note that this
amounts to saying that the correct labeling has periodicity  in the
 direction.

Values of the doublet boundary terms 

Trivial theory:  

Having defined the finite Kac tables, we can make an important observation.
 From the formula (), with the parametrisation (),
the central charge is equal to zero for . (Note also that
the coset () trivialises.) The corresponding theory is therefore
expected to be trivial, i.e., with all conformal weights equal to zero.

When , it follows from Eq. () that all physical operators
have trivial indices on the  side: .
Moreover, using the symmetry () we see that the only allowed
excitations on the  side are the following:
 _0  && _(1,,1)(1,1,,1,1,1,,1,1) ,
 

 _k  && _(1,,1)(1,1,,1,2,1,,1,1) ,
 0<k<r,
 

 _r  && _(1,,1)(1,1,,1,1,1,,1,3) ,
 

 _R  && _(1,,1)(1,1,,1,1,1,,1,2) ,
 where in the second line we have . As already discussed, the
operators  and  are, respectively, the identity operator
and a fundamental disorder operator .
 
We assume that every physical operator in a  theory should have
. When applied to the operators (), this allows
us to compute the values of all the boundary terms, for each
odd , by using the Kac formula (). One obtains:
 B_R &=& N-1 32  

 B_k &=& k(N-2k) 4N , k=0,1,,N-1 2 . 
 In the above equation  and  denote, respectively, the boundary
terms of the operators  and , whose positions have
been defined in Eq. (). The value of  confirms
Eq. ()-the boundary term for a disorder operator-as it
should, since  is a fundamental disorder operator,
cf. Eq. (). Also,  is trivially a singlet and
corresponds to the boundary term .

The task of finding the boundary terms  of the doublets 
has therefore been reduced to the problem of associating each value
 to the correct charge sector or, in other words, to determine
the nature of the operators  with . We shall
assume that among the operators listed in Eq. (), each
sector of the theory is represented exactly once. Since the singlet
and disorder sectors have already been accounted for, it follows that
the operators  with  are necessarily a
permutation of the (fundamental) doublet operators. Below, we shall
consider the problem of determining which  permutation, for
general .
 
Position of the fundamental operators 

In Section 3.3 we have succeeded in determining the positions
on the weight lattice of the fundamental operators in each sector, in
the special case of . The general structure of these results is most
easily seen if one introduces a new notation for the doublet sectors,
by doubling the  charges:
 Q = 2 q  mod   N. We shall distinguish between the two notations by placing an asterisk after
the indices which are to be read in the  notation. Note that since 
is odd, the  labels are simply a permutation of the  labels.
The results of Section 3.3 can now be written in the form:
 _(1,1,1)(2,1,1)  && D^3 D^1^* , 

 _(1,1,1)(1,2,1)  && D^1 D^2^* , 

 _(1,1,1)(1,1,3)  && D^2 D^3^* . Comparing the positioning () with Eq. (), we
obtain the results (), (), and ().

Moreover, we have explicitly computed the dimensions
of the fundamental doublet  for each  in Section 2.1.4.
By using the Kac formula (), it is easy to verify
that the dimensions ()-() correspond,
respectively, to:
 _(2,1,,1)(1,,1)   and  
 _(1,,1)(2,1,,1)  
with the boundary term
 B_D^1^*  = N-2 4N . 
 Thus, ,
and the value of the bondary term  confirms ().

It is now not difficult to guess the labeling of the operators
 for general :
 _0 _(1,,1)(1,1,,1,1,1,,1,1) 
 && S=I, 

 _k _(1,,1)(1,1,,1,2,1,,1,1) 
 && D^k^* , 0<k<r, 

 _r _(1,,1)(1,1,,1,1,1,,1,3)  && D^r^* .
 Below we shall give a (partial) demonstration of ().

Consider a general physical operator , 
for which the  simple reflections  give:
 ^(0) _s_e _i    -^(0) _  &=&
 n'_i  2 , i=1,2,,r-1, 

 ^(0) _s_e _r    -^(0) _  &=&
 n'_r  4  
with .
As discussed in Section 3.1, the ghost operator
 (charge sector ) indicates a
singular state in the module of the physical operator
 (charge sector ). Their respective boundary
terms  and  must then satisfy
 B_D^q_2  -B_D^q_1   + n  4  = ^q_1 _q_2  + k_1,2 . 
 Here, the gap  is defined by Eq. (),
 is a non-negative integer, and  is a positive
integer (which is even if  above). The right-hand side of
Eq. () is the degeneracy level of 
with respect to the singular state .

The gaps in a generic singlet module are given by Eq. ().
In the -notation this can be rewritten as
 ^0 _Q = Q(N-Q) 2N   mod   1.

(Note that this is not obtained naively, by substituting 
in Eq. ().) Thus, choosing in particular the physical
operator to be a singlet,  and , the condition
() fixes the general form of the boundary term :
 B_D^Q  = Q(N-Q) 2N -k_Q  4 ,
 where  is an integer which depends on . Note that the
set of values  can be fixed, for example, from knowledge of
the levels of degeneracy of the fundamental operators.   

If  is a prime number it is easy to prove, by comparison of
Eqs. () and (), that  and so
 B_D^q*  =B_q* , q*=0,1,,r. 
 This then proves Eq. (). 

If  is not prime, some ambiguity remains. Let us consider the quantity
 _Q' ^0 - _Q" ^0 =
 ( Q'-Q" 2  - (Q'+Q")(Q'-Q") 2N  )  mod   1.
Note that , and so if  is prime the right-hand
side can only vanish if . On the other hand, if  for
some integers , the right-hand side can vanish for 
 provided that  and 
 (or vice versa).  In this case we would have 
, and the argument leading to ()-which
was based on the level structure of the modules-would break down; we
would not be able to distinguish between the charge sectors  and
. In particular, in addition to () the solution

 B_D^Q  &=& B_Q , Q=0,1,,r; Q Q', Q", 

 B_D^Q'  &=&B_Q" ,  

 B_D^Q"   &=& B_Q'  would a priori be acceptable.
(For , one would have  and . In this case there
is no ambiguity as the boundary term of the singlet sector is trivially
. The positioning () of the fundamental operators 
is then the only one that is acceptable.) 

Summarising, we have explicitly proved for  that the
positioning () is the only correct one. For   
we have no strict arguments to exclude some additional
possibilities, such as (). However, we find it natural to
assume that the theories that we are constructing should have a similar
structure for all . We shall therefore accept the solution
() for all . 

Summarising, we write here the final result for the boundary terms:
 B_R       &=& N-1 32 , 

 B_S       &=& 0, 

 B_D^Q   &=& Q(N-2 Q) 4N , Q=1,2,,N-1 2 . 
 Alternative derivation of doublet boundary terms 

We now briefly show that it is possible to derive the boundary terms
of the doublet sectors without making reference to the  theories.
In this second argument, which is based on the technique of Weyl
reflections, we make two important assumptions:
 
 The positions of the fundamental operators are given by ().
 The levels of degeneracy  of a fundamental operator belong to
  the interval .

We start by applying the  simple Weyl reflections  to
the identity operator . This yields the
following differences of dimensions:
 ^(0) _(1,,1)s_e _i (1,,1) 
 -_(1,,1)(1,,1) 
 &=&1 2 , i=1,2,,r-1,  

 ^(0) _(1,,1)s_e _r (1,,1) 
 -_(1,,1)(1,,1) &=&1 4 , with .
The only labeling consistent with Eqs. ()-() is
 _(1,,1)s_e _i (1,,1)  && D^1,  i=1,2,,r-1, 

 _(1,,1)s_e _r (1,,1)  && D^r,
and in addition we deduce the boundary term . Note
that this implies that the module of the identity has a singular doublet
 state at level  and  singular doublet  states at level
. In the special case of , our explicit degeneracy computations
have indicated the mechanism by which the doublet  states may proliferate,
as required by this scenario. In particular, we expect that for  the
relation analogous to () no longer holds true.

With the boundary term  in hand, we next consider the simple
Weyl reflections of the fundamental doublet  operator
. In particular, the reflection
 gives a doublet  singular state which, according
to Eq. (), should be found on level .
This leads to the identity
 ^(0) _(1,,1)(1,2,1,,1,2,-1) +B_D^r-1  -
 ^(0) _(1,,1)(1,2,1,,1) -B_D^1 
 =N-5 2N ,
from which we determine the boundary term .

Knowing now the corresponding boundary term, we can consider the reflections
of the fundamental doublet  operator, etc. Proceeding like this in a
systematic way, one can determine all boundary terms ().

General theory 

Having fixed the positions of the fundamental operators and determined the
values of all the boundary terms of the theory, the remaining problem is to
fill the rest of the Kac table. In other words, we have to assign correctly
the boundary terms () to the Kac formula () for every
vertex of the weight lattice. This amounts to determining the sector
label with respect to the group  of each operator in the theory
(the case of the fundamental operators was settled in Section 3.5).

After having addressed this question, we dedicate the rest of the present
Section to a study of the characteristic equations of various three-point
functions. These will give us independent verifications of a number of
aspects of our theory, and also yield some new results.

Filling the lattice 

Although the Kac table of the  theory, with , is based
on a -dimensional lattice, it suffices to fill one "basic layer", for
instance on the  side, whose vertices have the positions
. The filling of the other
layers is obtained by shifting the filling of the basic layer. Namely,
the nature of the operator 
depends only on the differences .

Until now we have extensively used the fact that the degeneracies in the
modules could be read off from the Weyl reflections of the weight lattice. In
this section we shall exploit another useful rule of the Coulomb gas
representation.

We consider the multiplication (fusion) of two operators in the basic layer,
 _(1,,1)(n'_1 ,,n'_r )   _(1,,1)(m'_1 ,,m'_r ) .
According to the Coulomb gas rules this produces, in the principal channel,
an operator  with
  _(1,,1)(l'_1 ,,l'_r ) &=&
  _(1,,1)(n'_1 ,,n'_r ) 
 + _(1,,1)(m'_1 ,,m'_r )  

 l'_i &=&n'_i + m'_i -1, i=1,2,,r. The non-principal channels follow the principal one by shifts realised
by linear combinations (over the integers) of the simple roots 
(with ).

The above rule is extremely useful in fixing the distribution of operators on
the lattice. It should however be used with some care, since the amplitude of
the principal channel may vanish (see below).

Disorder operators 

Postponing for the moment the potential difficulty of vanishing
amplitudes, we begin by examining for example the fusion of the
fundamental disorder operator  and the
fundamental doublet  operator .
The result must necessarily be another disorder operator, since in the dihedral
group the product of a reflection and a rotation yields another reflection.
Thus,  is
a disorder operator. Proceeding in this way it is easy to verify that the
operator  with  odd is
a disorder operator . More generally:
 _(n_1 ,,n_r )(n'_1 ,,n'_r )  R,  when  
 n_r -n'_r   is odd . We have thus filled half of the lattice with disorder operators.

An independent verification of this result can be obtained by the method of
reflections. First, it is not difficult to see that all Weyl reflections,
applied to an arbitrary operator 
in the basic layer, conserve the parity of . This is at least
consistent with the above separation between disorder and singlet/doublet
operators.

To perform a more detailed check, we consider the  simple Weyl reflections
of the fundamental disorder operators .
These map the ghost operator
, with
, into the module of the disorder operator
. The indices of the ghost operator read
 m'^(i) _j   &=& 1,  for   j<i-1  and   i+1<j<r; 

 m'^(i) _i-1 &=& m^(i) _i+1 =2; m'^(i) _i =-1;  m'^(i) _r =2 for , while for  they read
 m'^(r) _j =1,  for   j<r-1;  m'^(r) _r-1 =3; m^(r) _r =-2.
All the  simple reflections give the result  for
the difference of dimensions
 ^(0) _(1,,1)(m'^(i) _1 ,,m'^(i) _r ) -
 ^(0) _(1,,1)(1,,1,2) = 1 2 ,
  for   i=1,2,,r. This on one hand confirms the fact that the fundamental disorder operator
 has  singular states at level ,
as was supposed in Section 3. On the other hand, it classifies all the
concerned ghost operators

as disorder operators.

More generally, it is not difficult to see that the difference between
the Coulomb term of the dimension of any operator
 with even  and the ghost
operators obtained by acting on it with (not necessarily simple)
reflections equals a half-integer. This is in strong support of the
result ().

Singlet operators. Periodicity of the filling 

It remains to assign the doublet  operators and the singlet operators
 to the lattice sites  with
 odd.

The singlet operator  form a subalgebra, as the fusion between two
singlets  produces another singlet. Furthermore, the fusion
 gives another doublet . The importance of the above
consideration is that once the positions of the first non-trivial
singlets (different from the identity) have been found, along each of
the principal lattice directions, these will set the periodicity of
the labeling of all lattice sites.  To see this, one first considers
the fusion of these non-trivial singlets among themselves, the result
being a periodic distribution of singlet operators throughout the
lattice. The periodicity in each lattice direction is given by the
distance between the first non-trivial singlet in that direction and
the identity operator. The remaining (non-singlet) labels can now be
translated throughout the lattice by fusing the corresponding
operators with all available singlets.

As noticed above, it might happen that the amplitude of the principal channel
vanishes. But in view of the role of the singlets in setting the periodicity
of the filling, it seems natural to suppose that this does not happen in
fusions involving singlets.

Notice that the symmetry () of the finite Kac tables implies
that the periodicity in the  direction must be . The remaining
part of the task is to find the periodicities in the other lattice directions,
and to specify the labeling of the sites in a -dimensional hypercube
of the lattice that corresponds to the given periodicity.

Doublet operators 

To determine this periodicity, and to position the required non-fundamental
doublet operators, we have first tried using the method of fusions.
Consider for instance fusing the fundamental doublet  with itself
 _(1,,1)(2,1,,1)   _(1,,1)(2,1,,1)   _(1,,1)(3,1,,1) .
The result can either be a doublet  or a singlet , since the
addition of -charges  is ambiguous. Further fusions can
be used to establish that there is only a finite number of possible
periodicities along each lattice direction (in particular, the periodicity
cannot exceed ), but no definite answer emerges. Moreover, in the
 theory with , which we have studied in great detail, the
application of the fusion method leads to a number of inconsistencies with
the method of Weyl reflections. We conclude that the fusion method should
be abandoned, since the fusion of two particular doublets can (and does;
see below) lead to vanishing amplitudes in a few cases.

We therefore turn to the method of reflections. The idea is that the
number of elements in the complete Weyl group, , is in
general very large. Thus, classifying  ghost operators for each
fundamental operator-whose positions are supposed to be given by
Eq. ()-will fix the labels of a large number of
lattice sites close to the origin, hopefully enabling us to discern
the correct periodicity.

We have pursued this idea for  and , using a computer.
As a first step, the Weyl group was generated in a recursive fashion, as
follows. Recall that the elements of the Weyl group can be represented as
words made out of an -letter alphabet,
, each word having
it minimal possible length. In the case of the algebra , there is
a unique longest element represented by a word of length ;
moreover, all lengths  satisfying  correspond
to at least one element. Therefore, all elements of length  can be
generated by prefixing the words representing elements of length 
by each of the  letters in the alphabet. For each word generated, one
tests whether it represents a new element of the Weyl group by considering
its action on a fixed lattice site in the fundamental chamber, and comparing
to the action of elements represented by shorter words. The recursion starts
from the simple Weyl reflections, and terminates once an element of length
 has been generated.

For , the resulting classification of  singlet and
doublet operators made it evident that the correct filling has periodicity
2 in the  direction, for , and periodicity 4 in
the  direction. In particular, the first non-trivial singlets
(different from the identity) along each lattice direction are situated at
  _(1,,1)(1,1,,1,3,1,,1,1)  && S, 0<k<r,
  

  _(1,,1)(1,1,,1,1,1,,1,5)  && S,
  where in the first line . Fusions by these singlets subsequently
permitted us to label all operators in the hypercubic unit cell
  & &1 n'_k 2, 0 < k < r, 

  & &1 n'_r 4, whose translation throughout the lattice yields the complete filling.
Note that the sites in the cell () with  have
already been classified as disorder operators, by Eq. ().

The results ()-() on the periodicity
was confirmed by the case , where  singlet and
doublet operators on the four-dimensional weight lattice were classified.
(It is worth mentioning a slight problem that appears in the analysis.
Namely, for  the reflection method cannot distinguish between 
and  operators. This is essentially because the Coulomb part of the
dimensions () of two operators linked by a Weyl reflection
always differ by , where  is an integer. It is this difference,
taken modulo 1, that serves to classify a given ghost operator.
With  distinct singlet and doublet sectors, this will necessarily
lead to ambiguities for . (In the case  the ambiguity can
be resolved by using the known positions of the fundamental operators.)
These ambiguities are related to
those discussed near Eq. ().) 

We now give the general result on the labeling of the unit cell
(). It is most easily stated in terms of the
-notation for the doublets, cf. Eq. (). Defining:
 x_i &=& n_i -n'_i   mod   2, i=1,2,,r-1, 

 x_r &=& n_r -n'_r  2   mod   2,
the doublet charge  associated with the position
 is given by
the recursive formula
 Q(x_1,x_2,,x_k-1 ,1,0,,0) =
 k -  Q(x_1,x_2,,x_k-1 ,0,0,,0), with the initial condition . For the case of 
this reads explicitly:
 _(1,1,1)(1,1,1)  S,     _(1,1,1)(1,2,1)  D^2^* ,  _(1,1,1)(1,1,3)  D^3^* ,  _(1,1,1)(1,2,3)  D^1^* , 

 _(1,1,1)(2,1,1)  D^1^* ,  _(1,1,1)(2,2,1)  D^1^* ,  _(1,1,1)(2,1,3)  D^2^* ,  _(1,1,1)(2,2,3)  D^2^* . It is easy to prove from Eq. ()-using an induction
argument-that the number of doublet  operators
in the unit cell () equals , for
.

Note that the filling () implies that some of the
doublet-doublet fusions must have a vanishing amplitude in the
principal channel. For , an example is
 _(1,1,1)(1,2,1)  _(1,1,1)(2,1,3)   _(1,1,1)(2,2,3) .
According to Eq. (), both operators on the left-hand
side are . Using the Coulomb gas fusion rules, the resulting
operator should thus be either a  or a .
However, the operator  appearing on the
right-hand side has been classified as  in Eq. ().
Therefore the amplitude of the principal channel must vanish.



Characteristic equations 

We now present some additional verifications of the theory we have
constructed. To this end, we consider the characteristic equations for the
conformal dimensions of the operators which participate in a given fusion
(operator product expansion). These equations can be derived from the study of
the three-point correlation functions in a way analogous to that of
Refs. .

The three-point correlation functions considered below have the same
analytical properties as the ones studied in Ref.  for .
Therefore, for the more general case , the derivation of the
corresponding characteristic equations is the same. The details of the
calculations can be found in the Appendix C of Ref. .

We have considered the following correlation functions:
 


Here,  is a disorder operator whose module is
supposed to be completely degenerate at level 1/2, i.e.,
 or
. The operator
 is a generic disorder operator, and
 with  is a singlet or a doublet
 operator (we remind that  is the  charge in the notation
()).

The necessary condition for the
above function  to be non-zero is given by the following equation
on the dimensions of the operators ,  and :
 _R^(2)  -_^q*  +1 (N-1) 
 (1-2 N _q^*,r^* )
 _R^(1)  =
 (-1)^_q^*,r^*  N N-1 h^(2) _1  h^(1) _1  
 _R^(1)  .
 The values   and  are the zero mode
eigenvalues of the operators  and , as defined in
Eq. (). While    has been  fixed by the
computations presented in Section 2, we do not know the eigenvalue
 for a generic disorder operator. If we set
 or
, the eigenvalue
 in Eq. () is known and the dimension
 can be easily calculated for each of the two
channels  and .

Let us discuss, for example, the case
. In this case we
obtain:
 _^0  =_(1,,1)(1,,1) =0,
 _^r*  =_(1,,1)(1,,1,3) .
This  result is in agreement both with the fact that
 was deduced to be a doublet , see
Eq. (), and with the value of the boundary term
. Note also that the
Coulomb gas fusin rules are well respected. Indeed, as discussed previously,
we expect that the fusion 

produces in the principal channel the operator with


.
The  channel, corresponding to the identity operator, follows the
principal one by a shift
realised by the combination  of
screening vectors.

Actually, even when  is unknown, we can still do some amount of
verification by using Eq. (). Indeed, one of the two channels of
this equation could be used to define , by assuming a given value
of  for instance, chosen at a particular position in the
Kac table. The other channel, with , in which enters the same
, could then serve to check for the presence of
 at the appropriate position in the Kac table, having the
value calculated from the characteristic equation (). We have in
this way verified the compatibility of the theory with Eq. ().




The module of the operator  is supposed to be degenerate at
levels  and , i.e.,
 or
 (see Section 2).
We derive the following equation for the dimensions:
 _^0  -_^r _(2)  -1 N-1 
 _^r _(1)  =
 -N N-1 h^(2) _1  h^(1) _1  _^r _(1)  ,
 where  and  are respectively the eigenvalues
of the operators  and , as defined in
Eq. ().

We consider the operators  and
, with  integer.
The above operators have  charge , as it can be seen
from Eq. (). We know from the reflection-type arguments
that these operators are degenerate at level . If we set
  or
, then the
correspondent eigenvalue  is determined by
Eq. (). In this case, Eq. () has
respectively the solutions:
 _^0  =_(1,,1)(2n-1,1,,1)   and  
 _^0  =_(2n-1,1,,1)(1,,1) .
We conclude that the singlets 
and  are produced in a non principal
channel of the fusion
. This is in agreement with the
Coulomb gas rules and with the filling of the weight lattice that we have
given previously.




In the above function we suppose
 or
, and
 or
.
Taking into account that the modules of these
operators are degenerate at level , we obtain the
characteristic equation:
 _^1  =_^r _(2)  +N-3 N-1 
 _^r _(1)  .
 Once again, the above equation is consistent with the theory. For
example, if we consider the fusion

we have from Eq. () that
 _^1  =_(1,,1)(2n-1,2,1,,1) .
The doublet 1 operator 
is expected to be produced in a non-principal channel of the
fusion considered above, since
  _(1,,1)(2n-1,2,1,,1) =
  _(1,,1)(2,1,,1) +
  _(1,,1)(2n,1,,1) -e _1.
The placing of the doublet  operator at the position

is confirmed by the above result.

Discussion 

In this paper, we have constructed and analysed the
conformal field theories based on the second solution of the
 parafermionic algebra, with  ().

We have achieved the principal goal of giving the Kac formula for these
theories (), i.e, the formula for the conformal dimensions of
operators which realise the degenerate representations of the parafermionic
algebra. To obtain this result, we had to determine the boundary terms for
each sector, Eq. (), and to determine to which sector belongs each
operator in the Kac table (see Eq. ()).

We want to stress here that the weight lattice of the Lie algebra  is
also known to accommodate the primary fields of the the  conformal
field theories. The Kac formula of these theories, was defined, among those of
other  theories, by Fateev and Luk'yanov in Ref. . It should
be noticed that the Kac formulae of both the present theory and of 
is invariant under the symmetry ().

However, the content of these two conformal theories,  and ,
second solution, are completely different. In the case of the  theory,
the  weight lattice is filled with two kinds of operators, corresponding
to the Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond sector (alias the  neutral sector and the
spin operator sector). In the case of the  theory, second solution,
the same weight lattice accommodates singlet, doublet  and disorder
operators. The important point is that the distribution of singlets, doublet
 and disorder operator on the lattice is consistent with the symmetry
(), as well as with the decoupling of the operators outside the
physical domain ().

It is natural to assume that, for each , the infinite set of unitary
theories with  and  describe multicritical fixed points
in statistical systems with  symmetry. It would be interesting to
verify this assumption by finding lattice realisations of the corresponding
models and studying them numerically.

From a theoretical point of view, it is important to remark that it is
not in general (except for some special cases; see Section 2)
practicable to find the dimensions of the fundamental operators by
means of explicit degeneracy computations. We bypassed this problem
by exploiting the properties of the assumed Coulomb gas realisation of
the theory.

This leads us to conjecture that, assuming a particular lattice on which the
primary operators could be accommodated, this kind of approach could greatly
simplify the study of the representations of a given chiral algebra with a
free parameter. The first application of the above assumption would be the
study of the representations of the theory , with  even, which
should be based on the  weight lattice.

Note added in proof. 

After the completion of this work, P. Furlan attracted our
attention to the paper in which the representation
theory of the chiral algebra ()-() was considered.
Ref.  also gives partial results for an explicit
free field construction of the coset (), based on earlier
work of Gepner, and of Christe and Ravanini.
Our work differs from that of Ref.  in classifying
the primary fields representing the coset () according to their
 transformation properties, as singlet,  different doublets,
and disorder operators.
The Kac table proposed in Eq. (4.71) of Ref. contains three sectors for each odd , in sharp contrast with
the  sectors identified in the present work. Accordingly,
we do not agree on the dimensions of primary operators proposed
in Ref. .
