A velocity of a point particle in the -Minkowski spacetime is investigated. 
Characteristic points of the spacetime are that the Poincare group becomes a 
quantum group with , which is a mass dimension parameter, and is a 
kind of non-commutative geometry. We consider a particle in a
coordinate space instead of it in a momentum space which is discussed in many articles. 
We see that the particle's velocity has an uncertainty which depends on a length of  
particle's propagation. 


Introduction 
In cosmic ray physics, the following problems are not solved yet; anomalous 
detection of extremely high 
energy cosmic rays above the GZK cutoff ( eV) 
, and TeV- rays from Mrk 501 and Mrk 421. It was 
suggested that the absence of 
the GZK cutoff is closely related to violation of the Lorentz invariance. If 
the Lorentz 
invariance is violated or deformed, there is the possibility to explain that there is not 
the GZK cutoff at  eV.
Therefore we have to consider a mechanism for the violation or deformation of the 
symmetry. 

One of 
the characteristic features with respect to quantum gravity is the Plack length. If 
we would like to deal with this as an observer independent scale, the special relativity 
becomes a deformed one which has two scales; a velocity  and a mass . This 
is called the doubly special relativity which 
is explicitly realized by the -Poincare algebra. 
The -Poincare algebra is defined by replacing the Poincare algebra with a 
quantum group (Hopf algebra) with a parameter .  
In the limit , the Hopf algebra is reduced to the ordinary Lie 
algebra. Majid and Ruegg have pointed out that the -deformed 
algebra is the symmetry in the -Minkowski spacetime in which
time and spatial coordinates are non-commutative.
Some authors have discussed particle's velocity formulae
 in the -Minkowski spacetime. In the 
arguments, 
it was assumed that a velocity is defined by  which is true 
in the commutative Minkowski spacetime. In, by applying the 
formula to a massless particle, it was  predicted that the speed of light is dependent 
on its energy  and the parameter .  
In, by changing the rule of differentiation with respect to 
momenta, it was mentioned that the speed of light is undeformed. However validity of using
the formula 
in the -Minkowski spacetime has not been discussed sufficiently yet. 
It is known that there exists some bases of the -Poincare algebra
, which are related 
with each other by redefinition of the translation operators 
. In other words, the -deformation of the Poincare 
algebra is not unique. Since the dispersion relation is given as the Casimir operator 
of the algebra, the 
particle's velocity depends which bases we use, if the formula 
 is used. In this paper we would like to consider a 
velocity by avoiding using the formula, and would like to compare results.
The present paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review the 
-Minkowski 
spacetime and the -Poincare algebra. Some velocity formulae are given explicitly by 
using the bicrossproduct basis. In the section 3, we will see that the action of a free 
particle does not depend on , and  is interpreted as the expectation value of 
photon's velocity. There is the deviation of the photon's velocity from the value , 
because of the spacetime 
non-commutativity. The section 4 is devoted to the summary and the remarks.
Review of -Minkowski spacetime 
In this section, we briefly review the -deformed Poincare algebra, and present 
discussions about velocities of particles in the -Minkowski spacetime.

Drinfeld and Jimbo have proposed a 
prescription how to define a quantum 
enveloping algebra, which is q-deformation of an universal enveloping algebra of a simple 
Lie algebra, in terms of a Hopf algebra.  Since the
Poincare algebra is not a simple Lie algebra, it is not straightforward to apply  
the Drinfeld-Jimbo prescription to the Poincare algebra. It is well known that the 
Poincare algebra can be obtained by contraction of the  dimensional AdS algebra 
 which is a simple Lie algebra. In the 
limit  which is the AdS radius, the AdS algebra is reduced to the Poincare 
algebra. The contraction  with 
 of the q-deformed AdS algebra gives a -deformed Poincare 
algebra
. Here  is a real constant, and  is an imaginary 
parameter(It is possible to use a real parameter 
 instead 
of the imaginary . In this case, contraction is . )  with 
. The -deformation of the Poincare algebra is not unique 
, however which are 
related by 
redefinition of translation generators. For example, the 
-Poincare algebra in the bicrossproduct basis is given by  
&&[p_ ,p_ ]=0, 1 [p_0,M_i] =0,  1
[p_i,M_j]= i_ijk p_k             

&&[M_i,M_j]= i_ijk M_k ,1 
[M_i,N_j]=i_ijk N_k , 1
[N_i,N_j]=i_ijk M_k                     

&&[N_i,p_0]=ip_0  ,  1
[N_i,p_j] =i_ij (
 2 (
1-e^-2p_0   )
+1 2 p ^2 )-i  p_ip_j   with translation , rotation  and boost  generators. The  
subalgebra is undeformed. The coproducts are given by 
(M_i)M_i1+1 M_i  

(N_i)N_i1+(-p_0  ) N_i
+1  _ijk p_j M_k   

(p_i)p_i1+(-p_0  ) p_i     

(p_0)p_01+1 p_0  .
When the coproducts are given, counits and antipodes are obtained uniquely. But we do not 
write the detailed form since we do not use them in the present paper. 
In the limit , the Hopf algebra are reduced to the Poincare algebra. 
The mass shell condition is obtained as the Casimir operator;
m^2=(
2 (p_0 2  ))^2-p ^2e^p_0   .
                                        The mass  is not a physical one. A relation with a physical mass is suggested in 
. We find that the expression gives the upper bound of the 
momentum; . 
It was noticed that quantum groups can be realized as 
symmetries in non-commutative spaces(As a review article, see.)  
. The -Poincare algebra is the symmetry 
in the -Minkowski spacetime which is non-commutative;
[X^i,X^0]=1  X^i, 1 [X^i,X^j]=0. Although there are some bases of the algebra 
, 
all of them correspond to the commutator.
In the commutative Minkowski spacetime, a  particle's velocity  is written as 
v_i= E  p^i    with . Many authors have assumed that this 
relation is true also in the -Minkowski spacetime. For a 
massless particle, by solving () and using the formula () we have 
v^2=c^2 (2E  ).
So the velocity of a massless particle is deformed from the constant c, and has energy 
dependence. Because of the effect, the  has the constraint m from 
the astronomical observation of  rays. On 
the other hand, in, it was mentioned that the
rule for the differentiation with the momentum is changed since the momentum sum rule is 
-deformed. From the coproduct (), we notice that the sum of momenta 
 and  of two particles is deformed as
p_1+(-E_1  ) p_2
which is non-Abelian.
By applying this to the velocity formula, we have two kinds of velocities;

V_l ^i=(-E  )V^i 
, 1 V_r ^i= (1+1  pV)^-1 V^i.
We find that these two velocities satisfies  
for massless particles. 
A common property with respect to them is that the velocities are determined uniquely 
when their energies are given. In 
other words, the particle velocities have no uncertainty. However, there have to be 
exist such an uncertainty, because time and spatial coordinates of particles cannot be 
observed simultaneously by the non-commutativity (). We would like to 
investigate the point in the next section. 
Uncertainty of velocity 
Here we would like to see how velocities of point particles are deformed in the 
-Minkowski spacetime by using a method by which we can avoid arguments which depend 
on the bases of the -Poincare algebra. In order to do this, we consider a particle in 
coordinate space  instead of the momentum space.
When a space is a non-commutative one, there is the possibility that a 
symmetry on the space becomes a quantum group. The quantum group 
makes a commutator of coordinates covariant. In this formalism, a parameter 
of the non-commutativity is an invariant scale. By virtue of this, the 
doubly special relativity can be realized as a quantum group 
. We apply this to the -Minkowski spacetime ().
All of known bases of the -Poincare algebra correspond to the commutator () 
. So we can perform an analysis which is independent on 
a choice of the basis if we start from the commutator ().
The Poincare quantum group transformation of the coordinates is defined by  
X'^ =L^ _  X^ +a^ 
with
_ L^ _  L^ _  =_ .   Here  is the flat metric tensor.
We demand that the transformed coordinates  also satisfy the commutator 
(). 
The Poincare quantum group does not determined only by the covariance 
of the commutator. Furthermore we demand that differentiation with respect to  
is not deformed;
dX^ dX^ =-dX^ dX^ . 
In order for the condition () to be compatible with the Poincare quantum group,
() have to be commutative with all of the elements of the quantum group. By 
using the conditions, the Poincare quantum group is determined uniquely;
[L^ _  ,L^ _  ]0 , 1
[a^ ,a^ ]= 1  (^ _i^ _0-^ _i^ _0)a^i      

[a^ ,L^ _ k ] 1  
[(^ _ 0 -^ _0)^ _  +(^0 _  -^0_ )^ ]. 
                                                                          which is the dual Hopf algebra of ()-().  
Next we would like to see kinematics of a particle in the -Minkowski spacetime. The 
action of a free particle which is invariant under the Poincare quantum group ()
and () have the usual form; 
S=-12d [1 e (X ^ )^2-em^2]  with . On the other hand, when we consider the 
-deformed Poincare algebra ()-() as a bicrossproduct Hopf algebra 
, the invariant metric is 
(X_0)^2-(X^i)^2+3  X_0
which is different from ours. It is not clear why they are different. The canonical 
Hamiltonian is also -independent
H=1 2e [P_ P^ -m^2].
The action of the free particle does not depend on the non-commutativity parameter  
in the -Minkowski spacetime.  It is known that, in the non-commutative spacetime with 
, -dependent parts of free field 
theories' action 
vanish. This is the characteristic point in common. Although the action is 
-independent, the non-commutativity effects a change of physical quantities. In the 
rest of the present section, we see this explicitly.
Let's consider a velocity of a particle which is described by the action 
(). Because of the spacetime 
non-commutativity, we cannot observe strict values of  and  simultaneously, 
and there exists an ambiguity of the particle's velocity. At first, we see the 
expectation value of the velocity. It is natural to make the expectation values of the 
coordinates  be a 
solution of the equations of motion which are derived from the action () with 
. The expectation value of the particle velocity is 
v^id x^i   d t    = x ^i t  .
By using the equation of motion, we have  for massless particles. The expectation
value of the velocity satisfies the ordinary velocity formula. The invariant scale  
can be interpreted as the expectation value of a velocity of a massless particle.
Next we would like to see a deviation from the expectation value. The expectation value 
of a deviation from the expectation value  satisfy the inequality 
(X^i)^2(T)^2 
1 4c^2 ^2 X^i ^2    with . Here the index  is not summed.
The inequality means that time and spatial coordinates of a particle cannot be detected 
precisely 
at once except for at the origin in a coordinate system. When  is 
large, so is the uncertainty. This depends which coordinate systems we use.   
Let's consider a case in which a free particle starts from the origin 
 of the spacetime. At a later time, the particle is at 
 with . 
Since the  subalgebra of the Poincare algebra is not 
-deformed, without loss of generality, we can choose a coordinate system with 
L:=x^10,  1 x^2=x^3=0 .         In this case  in the right hand side of () is an 
expectation value of a propagation length of the particle during the time . Hence 
when the length  is very large so is the spacetime uncertainty. 
Here we would like to see a deviation from the expectation value . 
We denote  and 
.
Although the inequality () does not forbid both of  and  to be 
large, by analogy with quantum mechanics, we assume that they are small with the 
equality () satisfied. Under the 
condition with the configuration (), we find that the uncertainties along the 
directions  and  vanish; , and  and  have  
non-zero values. The spacetime uncertainty brings 
about the following velocity's uncertainty;
V^2 =  2 L^2 t^3 T 2 L t^2 X^1 
-4L t^3 X^1T 3L^2 t^4 (T)^2+1 t^2 (X^1)^2 
                                                            up to second order in  and .
We assume that  and  are so small that the first two terms in () 
are the dominant part. If we choose a configuration in which the first order terms are 
canceled 
with each other, this gives the minimum value of  approximately. So the minimum 
value of  is 
. V^2 _min -3v^3  Lc .        Here we have used .
Summary and remarks 
In this paper, we have investigated free particle's motion in the -Minkowski 
spacetime in which the Poincare group becomes the quantum group. The particle's action 
is not -deformed, since the invariant metric of the -Minkowski spacetime does 
not have  -dependence in our formalism. When we 
define particle's velocity, there exists uncertainty of the velocity because the 
spacetime coordinates are non-commutative operators with the commutator (). 
The point is different from the 
discussions in momentum spaces. We saw that the 
particle's velocity can depend on , even if the action is -independent. 
In ordinary relativistic classical theories, massless particles propagate only with 
the velocity  which is defined by . However in the -Minkowski 
spacetime, the massless particle's velocity have the uncertainty   
. V^2_min  -3c^2  L 
which does not depend on the energy of the particle but on the propagation length  of 
the particle. When  is small, so is the spacetime uncertainty 
(). However for a small , the velocity's uncertainty is large.  
The constant  can be interpreted as the expectation value of the photon's velocity.

In order to compatible with the observed value of , we have the bound 
. 
The typical length of light paths in experiments of velocity of light is of order 
-1m. 
So  is m which is weaker restriction than the one which is derived by 
using the formula ().
In a non-relativistic limit , the uncertainty () of the 
velocity can be negligible. The result is compatible with the fact that the only Lorentz 
boost part of the Poincare algebra is -deformed.
