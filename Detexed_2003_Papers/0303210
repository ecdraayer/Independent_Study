We construct a large- twisted reduced model of 
the four-dimensional super Yang-Mills theory coupled 
to one adjoint matter. 
We first consider a non-commutative version of the 
four-dimensional superspace, and then give the mapping rule 
between matrices and functions on this space explicitly. 
The supersymmetry is realized 
as a part of the internal  
gauge symmetry in this reduced model. 
Our reduced model can be compared with the Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory 
that claims the low-energy glueball superpotential 
of the original gauge theory is governed 
by a simple one-matrix model. 
We show that their claim can be regarded as the 
large- reduction in the sense that
the one-matrix model they proposed
can be identified with our reduced model.  
The map between matrices and functions enables us 
to make direct identities between the free energies 
and correlators of the gauge theory and the matrix model. 
As a by-product, we can give a natural explanation for 
the unconventional treatment of the one-matrix model 
in the Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory where eigenvalues lie 
around the top of the potential. 

Introduction 

Reduction of dynamical degrees of freedom has played a central role 
and has been paid much attention in physics. It sometimes reveals 
not only an essential structure of complicated systems, but their 
fundamental degrees of freedom. For example, 
the renormalization group, the basic idea of which 
is the reduction of degrees of freedom 
by the block spin transformation, gives us 
insights into the universality of quantum field theory. 
Another example is the large- reduction. 
This states that in the large- limit gauge theories 
in any dimensions are in a sense equivalent. Thus it can be 
regarded as a universality of the large- field theories. 
Furthermore, the reduced model brings some insights into 
the fundamental degrees of freedom of string theory. For example, 
there are a few kinds of large- reduced models 
which are conjectured to be nonperturbative formulations 
of string/M theory. One is the Matrix theory, 
which is the large- reduced model in one dimension.  
There, the fundamental degrees of freedom are the D-particles 
whose space-time coordinates are described by large- matrices. 
Another prototype is the IIB matrix model, 
which is the large- reduced model in zero dimension. 
Here the eigenvalues of matrices 
may be regarded as the space-time points themselves. 

Recently Dijkgraaf and Vafa have made a claim that the exact 
low-energy superpotential for  gauge theories 
can be obtained by the perturbative computations in simple 
matrix models. 
There, only planar diagrams of the matrix models 
contribute to the results, even if the large- limit is not 
taken in the original gauge theories. Though this claim is 
motivated by topological strings, 
it can be proved purely by the gauge theory considerations 
in. Among others, in a proof 
of the Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory is presented transparently 
by comparing the Schwinger-Dyson equations 
of the gauge theory and the matrix model.
 
At first sight, the Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory is another kind of 
the reduction of degrees of freedom, because it arises not from 
the large- limit, but from the supersymmetry as shown in 
. However, in this paper, we show that the Dijkgraaf-Vafa 
theory can be regarded as the large- reduction. 
The idea is quite simple; we first consider the noncommutative 
supersymmetric gauge theory, and express it in terms of matrices. 
Here the noncommutative space-time is considered 
just as a tool to map the gauge theory to a matrix model. 
In fact, we can show that the noncommutativity does not 
contribute to the holomorphic quantities which appear in the 
Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory. Because the original gauge theory is defined 
on the superspace, we need to consider the noncommutative superspace 
where the fermionic coordinates are also noncommutative. 
As a consequence, the original gauge theory is mapped to a supermatrix 
model. We show that this model is nothing but the matrix model 
that Dijkgraaf-Vafa considered. 

This paper is organized as follows. In section , 
we review the Scwinger-Dyson approach of the Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory, 
where we slightly modify the argument in. 
In particular, we clarify the origin 
of the Konishi anomaly, 
which plays an important role in our argument as well. 
In section , we review 
the basic facts on the relationship between noncommutative 
gauge theories and matrix models. 
In section , we construct the large- twisted 
reduced model of the noncommutative supersymmetric 
gauge theory. Then we consider the noncommutative superspace 
and the gauge theory defined on it. We show that it is mapped 
to a supermatrix model. In section , we find 
a direct relation between the correlation functions and free energies 
of the supersymmetric gauge theory and the supermatrix model. 
Then we show that our supermatrix model captures the low-energy 
superpotential and incorporates the Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory. 
The point here is that 
we can make a direct map between the supersymmetric gauge theory 
and the supermatrix model.
Section  is devoted to discussions. 
In appendix , we give a derivation 
of the Konishi anomaly on the bosonic noncommutative space. 








Review of the Schwinger-Dyson approach 
We consider   gauge theory 
coupled to an adjoint matter . 
According to the Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory, the prepotential 
of this theory is identified with the  free energy 
of a large  one-matrix model.


In this section, we slightly modify the proof of 
using the Schwinger-Dyson equations. In this approach, 
the Konishi anomaly enters as a result of the regularization of 
, the value of the -function 
at the origin of the superspace, that appears 
in the Schwinger-Dyson equations. 
In section 5, this quantity plays an important role 
to connect the field theory correlation functions 
with those of the matrix model.
 


The action of the  gauge theory is given by
 
Here  is a chiral superfield in the adjoint representation of  ,  is the gauge coupling constant, 
 is the vector potential,  is the field strength 
  and  is a -th order polynomial superpotential 
 


This theory is invariant under the translation , where   is 
an anticommuting c-number, because all fields are in the adjoint representation so that the  gauge field is 
decoupled. Owing to this symmetry, the low energy effective action  can be expressed by a prepotential 
 
 

The  dependence of  is given by the resolvent as follows. First by differentiating the partition 
function with respect to , we obtain 
  
If we introduce the resolvent 
  
the right hand side is expressed as 
  By comparing () and (), we find that the  derivative of  
can be expressed as
  
We can determine the prepotential by solving the Schwinger-Dyson equations up to some ambiguities, and in order to fix 
them, we impose the following  conditions 
  
where  is a contour around the -th critical point. Thus we obtain   as  a function of 
.



Corresponding to the gauge theory (), we consider  
the  one-matrix model given by
 
where  is the same polynomial potential as () and  is an appropriate constant of dimension 
three that makes the action dimensionless.


The free energy of the matrix model is defined by
 

Again the  derivative of the free energy can be expressed by the resolvent as follows   
As we will see below,  obeys the same Schwinger-Dyson equation as . Therefore if we impose  
 conditions given by 
 
 and  become identical functions up to  independent part.




Schwinger-Dyson equations of the matrix model 
In order to obtain the Schwinger-Dyson equations for , we start from   By  shifting 
, we obtain 
  
By using the completeness of the  Gell-Mann matrices 
 
the equation becomes
* 
 Using the large  factorization, we obtain 
   
 and the right hand side can be rewritten as 
 *  
 Because the first term of the right hand side is the -th polynomial, () can be expressed as 
  This is an th-
order differential equation, and as we mentioned above, we need  conditions () to fix the ambiguities. 
In the next subsection we show that the Schwinger-Dyson equation for  
in the gauge theory is identical to ().




Schwinger-Dyson equations of the gauge theory 
As in the matrix model, we start from
  Again by  shifting 
*  
we obtain
 
If we take the limit , the third term becomes zero because of the property of the 
chiral ring, and there is no difficulty in the second term. However, the first term involves a singular factor 
, and we regularize it  by the heat kernel method as shown in appendix A:  

 

Thus () becomes 

 

Again by the property of the chiral ring, terms containing more than two factors of 
 vanish. In order to use this property, we can shift  in 
the Konishi anomaly, because 
such shifts of  part do not affect the commutator.
And by using the property of   and the factorization of the chiral ring, we obtain 
  
This form is exactly the same as (), and as in the matrix model, we can rewrite it in term of 
. 
We obtain the same differential equation as (), and also need  conditions () to fix the 
ambiguities. Here we emphasize that the Konishi anomaly can be understood as a result of 
,
which will play a crucial role in section 5.







The large- twisted reduced model 

In this section, we give a brief review of the large- twisted 
reduced model. 
We first introduce the noncommutative space
on which we define noncommutative field theory. 
Then we construct a mapping between field theory and matrix model. 

Noncommutative space 
In order to define a -dimensional noncommutative space, 
we first consider a quantum mechanics of degrees of freedom , 
which has  momenta and  coordinates. 
By taking appropriate linear combinations of them, we have 
operators  () that satisfy 
[_, _]=i,
where  is an antisymmetric tensor with real components, 
and . Later we will see that 
() can be obtained 
as a classical solution of a large- matrix model. 
Let  be the inverse matrix of  
C^ B_ =^  _ ,
and we define  by 
^ =_ .
Then  and  satisfy the following 
commutation relations: 
[^ , _ ]=i^  _ ,   
[^ , ^ ]=-i,   
[_ , _ ]=i.
We regard  () as the noncommutative coordinates 
of a -dimensional noncommutative space, and consider a field theory 
defined on it. In fact, various gauge theories defined on this space 
are known to arise as the low-energy effective theory 
of string theory or M-theory. In such a noncommutative field 
theory, fields or functions of  have one-to-one 
correspondence to operators in the original quantum mechanics 
via the Weyl ordering,
O(x)=e^ik_ x^  O (k)   
    O =e^ik_ ^  O (k).
Roughly speaking, the operator  corresponding to  
can be regarded as . In this correspondence, a Hermitian 
operator corresponds to a real function.  From (), 
we can read the following mapping rule between functions on 
the noncommutative space and operators (matrices):

 
If  and  correspond to  and  
respectively,  corresponds to , 
where the -product is defined by
O_1*O_2(x)=.()O_1(x)O_2(y) _y=x .
If  corresponds to , 
 O =1 (2)^D/2 C  d^Dx O(x). 


If  corresponds to ,  
corresponds to . 

Noncommutative field theory 
Now we construct a field theory defined on the noncommutative space, 
namely, noncommutative field theory. 
As the simplest example, we start with an infinite dimensional 
Hermitian matrix model 
S=(2)^D/2 C 
(-1 2 [p _ , ]^2+V( )).
Here  and  are Hermitian operators 
acting on a vector space, and we assume that  form 
an irreducible representation of the algebra (). 
Using the mapping rule described above, we can reinterpret 
this theory as a real scalar field theory defined 
on the noncommutative space 
S=d^Dx
  (1 2 (_ )^2+V())_*.
Here  means that every product is understood as the -product 
defined by (). 
If we take a reducible representation of () 
such as , 
where  is the irreducible representation 
of (), and  is the  unit matrix, 
() can be mapped 
to an  Hermitian matrix-valued scalar field theory 
S=d^Dx 
  (1 2 (_ )^2+V())_*.
Next we turn to quantum aspects of the noncommutative field theory. 
As is well known, if we deduce the Feynman rule of (), 
we have the noncommutative phase factor for each vertex 
arising from the -product. 
Due to this phase factor, if external momenta are much larger than 
, only the planar diagrams survive 
, which means that in high momentum region 
the noncommutative field theory is equivalent to the large- theory. 
On the other hand, if external momenta are much smaller than , 
this theory is at least classically equivalent 
to the ordinary field theory on the commutative space 
because the phase factor does not contribute. 
However, in quantum theory, the noncommutative field theory has an 
effective UV cutoff of order  due to the phase factor, 
where  is an external momentum. 
Therefore, if the theory does not have UV divergence at all 
as a field theory, we can take the low energy limit  
smoothly and the noncommutative field theory is reduced 
to the ordinary commutative field theory. 
However, if the theory has an UV divergence, 
it possibly violates this classical equivalence.

Noncommutative gauge theory 
If we consider the gauge theory on the noncommutative space 
in the same way, we find that the corresponding matrix model 
is nothing but the large- twisted reduced model. 
In order to see this, we consider the noncommutative  
gauge theory coupled to a fermion in the adjoint representation, 
S=d^Dx
  (1 g^2   (-1 4 F_ ^2
        -i 2  ^ [D_ ,]
  )
  )_*. 
The corresponding matrix model is obtained via the mapping rule as 
S=(2)^D/2 C 1 g^2   (1 4 [_ +_ ,_ +_ ]^2
       +1 2  ^ [_ +_ ,]
  ),
up to some ambiguities coming from the ordering.
Here  and the trace is taken 
over both the representation space of  and 
matrix. If we define 
_ =_ +_ ,
this action can be rewritten as 
S=(2)^D/2 C 1 g^2   (1 4 [_ ,_ ]^2
       +1 2  ^ [_ ,]
  ).
As a result,  dependence disappears in (). 
Instead, it has a classical solution  
where  satisfies () 
and if we expand () around it as (), 
we recover () or, equivalently, the noncommutative 
gauge theory (). 
() is the dimensional reduction 
of the  gauge theory with an adjoint matter 
to the zero dimension. This is nothing but the large- 
reduced model, and the expansion around the noncommutative 
background  is known 
as the twisted reduced model. 





Supersymmetric large- twisted reduced model  
 

Now we construct the large- twisted reduced model of 
the supersymmetric gauge theory with an adjoint matter. 
We do this in the following two steps:

 
[step1] We first describe the supersymmetric gauge theory 
on the noncommutative space in terms of superfield. 
At this stage, the four-dimensional bosonic coordinates  
become noncommutative, while the fermionic coordinates 
,  remain intact. 
As a result, each component of the superfield corresponds to 
a large- matrix. 

[step2] Next we make the fermionic coordinates  
,  noncommutative.Rigorously, fermionic coordinates become non-anticommutative. 
However, we call them 'noncommutative' fermionic coordinates for 
simplicity. 
As a result, a superfield corresponds to a supermatrix. 
Namely, all components are encoded into a single supermatrix.    


Large- reduction via superfield 
We are interested in the  gauge theory with one adjoint matter 
(). 
Before considering a noncommutative version of this theory, 
we rewrite this action in terms of fields appropriate for 
the large- reduction. When we concentrate on 
the chiral superfields as in Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory, 
convenient coordinates are given by . 
In fact, a solution of the chiral condition   
is in general given by 
(x,,) & = & (x+i ,) 

                 & = & (i _ )(x,)
                       (-i _ ),
where the superscript  indicates the representation 
in terms of ,  and . 
The advantage of the -representation is that a chiral superfield 
 does not have  component as above and that 
if we expand  with respect to  as
(y,)=(y)+2 (y)+F(y), 
 

all components , ,  are independent, 
arbitrary functions of . However, the natural coordinate for which 
we can introduce the noncommutativity is not  
but . Therefore, we rewrite the original action 
in terms of  appearing in (). 
Similarly, we define an antichiral superfield  by 
(x,,) 
 & = & (x-i ,) 

 & = & (-i _ )(x,)
      (i _ ).
Then the kinetic term of the matter field can be rewritten as 
(e^Ve^-V )
=(e^i _   
        e^V e^i _   
     e^-i _   
    e^-V  e^-i _  ).
This motivates us to define a new vector superfield
e^(x,,) 
(i _ )e^V(x,,) 
(i _ ).
Note that it is not a similarity transformation 
like (), and  is no longer 
a function but a first-order differential operator.
Obviously, . 
Thus the kinetic term becomes
(e^Ve^-V )=(e^ e^- ). 

Next we consider the kinetic term of the gauge field 
in (), which is written in terms of the field strength 
W_ (x,,)
=-1 4 e^-V(x,,) D_ e^V(x,,) .
It is worth noticing that this equation can be regarded as 
an equation for differential operators acting on the space 
of chiral superfields, as is the case with the field strength 
in the ordinary gauge theories. 
Namely, the action of the differential operator 
in the right-hand side of () 
on any chiral superfield is equal to the multiplication of . 
Because  is a chiral superfield, 
() tempts us to define  as 
W_ (x,,) 
 & = & _ (x+i ,) 

 & = & (i _ )_ (x,)
       (-i _ ).
In fact,  is exactly the field strength constructed 
from  defined in () in the same way as 
in ():
_  & = & e^-A W_ e^A 

          & = & -1 4 (e^-A e^A)(e^-A e^A)
                            (e^-A  e^-V  e^-A )(e^A D_  e^-A )
                            (e^A  e^V  e^A ) 

          & = & -1 4 e^- _  e^ , 
 

where , and 
_  & = & (i _ )D_ 
                (-i _ )
               = ,  

_  & = & (-i _ )_ 
                  (i _ )
                 =- ,
are natural differential operators on the new chiral or 
antichiral superfields,  and . 
Note that  and  do not contain  
because their similarity transformations 
in () are inverse to each other. Note also that 
() can again be regarded as an equation 
for differential operators acting on the space 
of the chiral superfields . 
Using , the kinetic term of the gauge field becomes 
(W^ W_ )=(W^(y) _ ).
Now we make the bosonic coordinates  noncommutative, which 
amounts to replacing all products appearing in () 
with the -product defined in ():
S_NC  & = &  ((e^Ve^-V ))_* 
             

       & + &  ((W^ W_ ))_*
         + ( W())_*+c.c. 

       & = &   ((e^e^- ))_* 
            

       &   & + ((W^(y) _ ))_*
             + ( W())_*+c.c.,
 
 

Following the prescription given in subsection , 
we can express it in terms of matrices.
We first introduce the noncommutative space-time coordinate 
 and  that satisfy (). 
Then by the mapping rule given in subsection , 
we have matrix variables corresponding to the chiral superfield, 
antichiral superfield, vector superfield, and field strength, 
respectively, 
() & & (x,), 

() & & (x,), 
 
(,) & & (x,,), 
 
_  () & & _  (x,). 
The action () is rewritten as  
given by 
S_red 
 & = &   (() e^(,) 
                         () e^-(,) ) 
  
 & + &  ( ^ ()_ ())
      +  W(())+c.c.,
where 
_ =-1 4 e^- _ e^ ,
and  is taken over both  group and the representation 
space of (). As seen in (), this is nothing but 
the large- twisted reduced model of the original theory 
(). It should be noted that  holds 
as an identity. 

Properties of the supersymmetric reduced model 
In this subsection we discuss some interesting properties 
of the supersymmetric reduced model (). 

First, as is the case with the ordinary large- reduced model 
(), it does not have background dependence at all. 
In general, as we have seen in the previous section, 
 appears in the action 
through the mapping rule , 
where 
 denotes the adjoint action of .
However, our action does not have explicit  dependence.  
In fact, the  derivatives do not appear in the definition 
of ,  and , as shown in () and (). 
Moreover, the equation of motion of () 
for the vector superfield  is given by 
D_ e^ ^ e^- =0,
which has a special solution 
e^ =e^2 ,
where . 
As is evident from the construction in the previous subsection, 
if we expand  around this background as 
e^ =e^ e^ , 
the action () becomes 
S_red    
 & = &  (e^e^-
  
 & + &  ( ^  )
       +  W(where
& = & e^ e^- , 

& = & e^- e^ , 

  & = & e^ _ e^- 
             =-1 4 e^- e^
 
   D_  & = & e^- D_  e^ 
             = 
              -(^ )_ _ , 
 
_  & = & e^ _  e^- 
             =- 
              +(^ )_ _ .
By using the mapping rule given in subsection , 
we recover the noncommutative supersymmetric gauge theory 
(), where ,  and  are mapped 
to ,  and , respectively. 
This is a supersymmetric analog of what happens 
in the bosonic twisted reduced model discussed 
in subsection . In particular,  
in () is a supersymmetric analog 
of  given in (). 
Indeed, it is easy to compute 
the components of  in () and to find 
that after the usual rescaling , 
the  component of  is given 
by , 
where  is the -component of . 
Similarly,  corresponds to 
 
in the bosonic twisted reduced model. 

Next we discuss the symmetry of the supersymmetric reduced model. 
The action () is manifestly invariant under the following 
transformation:
& & e^-i e^i , 
 
& & e^-i^                         e^i^  , 
 
e^  & & e^-i^  e^ e^i ,

where  is an arbitrary chiral superfield, . 
This symmetry is the counterpart of the ordinary gauge symmetry 
of the supersymmetric gauge theory (). 
Remarkably, this symmetry includes the supersymmetry 
of the corresponding noncommutative gauge theory (). 
In this sense, in the twisted reduced model (), 
the gauge symmetry and the supersymmetry are unified. 
This fact can be shown as follows: take the background () 
and make the expansion around it as (), 
then we get the action (). In terms of the fields 
appearing in (), the gauge transformation becomes 

& & e^-ie^i
 
& & e^-i^  
                        e^i^  , 
 
e^& & e^-i^  e^                         e^i
where . Note that if 
 is chiral, namely, , then 
 is chiral, namely, .
Now we consider a particular gauge transformation () 
with  given by 
  
      +^ (- 
                        -2(^ )_ _ ).
If we expand the theory around the background (), 
this symmetry becomes the gauge symmetry () 
with  given by 
 (  
                       +(^ )_ _ )
      +^ (- 
                        -(^ )_ _ )+,
where  is a complex number. 
Because , the infinitesimal form 
of the gauge transformation () is given by 
& = & (-i               =(-i^ Q_ -i^ _ )               
 
& = & (-i^ )                =(-i^ Q_ -i^ _ )                
 
V' & = & (-i            =(-i^ Q_ -i^ _ )V',  

where 
Q_  & = &  +(^ )_ _ , 
                                                         
 
_  & = & - -(^ )_ _ .
Note that the transformation law for  becomes a similarity 
transformation due to the Hermiticity of . 
() are equivalent to the ordinary supercharges 
in the noncommutative gauge theory () 
via the mapping rule . 
Therefore, we have shown that once we expand the original model 
() around the background (), we get the 
noncommutative gauge theory () and its 
supersymmetry originates from the gauge symmetry () 
of the original model. In the ordinary field theory, 
what makes difference between 
the gauge symmetry and the supersymmetry is that 
the former is generated by functions of ,
while the latter by the derivative , 
 and . 
However, in the large- twisted reduced model, 
or in the noncommutative space,
there is no definite 
difference between the 'coordinate' and the 'momentum' as we can see 
from eq.(). This is the reason why the gauge symmetry 
and the supersymmetry are unified in ().


Noncommutative superspace and supermatrix model  
 
As mentioned in the beginning of this section, the next task is to 
introduce the noncommutative fermionic coordinates as well as the 
bosonic coordinates. Then it is expected that a field depending 
on the noncommutative fermionic coordinates 
 or  is also mapped to a matrix, 
as a field on the noncommutative bosonic coordinates 
 becomes the large- matrix. It is shown that a field 
on the noncommutative superspace is described by a supermatrix. 

We begin with introducing a noncommutativity into the fermionic 
coordinates as 
^ ,^ =^ ,   
^ ,^ =^* ,
where  is a symmetric matrix.
In what follows, we consider only  part because 
 can be treated in the same way by replacing
 with . 
By using the  transformation, 
 can be taken in the following form 
without loss of generality:
(^ )=( 
       ),   C .
In this case,  can be represented in terms of 
Pauli matrices as 

^1= ^1,   ^2= ^2.
Let  be the inverse matrix of  
^ _ =^  _ ,
and define  by 
_ =_ ^ .
Then  and  satisfy the following 
anticommutation relations:
^ ,_ =^  _ ,   
^ ,^ =^ ,   
_ ,_ =_ .
As in the case of the bosonic noncommutative space, 
we regard  as the noncommutative fermionic coordinates 
and make a correspondence between a function on this space 
and an operator (a matrix) via the Weyl ordering: 
O()= e^i^ _  O ()
     
O = e^i^ _  O ().
As before, the operator  is nothing but the Weyl ordered 
form of . 

It is interesting to consider what corresponds to the fermionic 
integration  in the space of operators 
under the correspondence (). 
In general, a function of  can be expanded as 
() & = & +2 ^ _ +F 

          & = & +2 ^ _ -2^1^2 F. 
then . On the other hand, 
the operator corresponding to  is given by its Weyl 
ordered form
() & =& +2 ^ _ 
                -(^1^2-^2^1)F 

            & =& +2 ^ _ +F. 
 

Because we have fixed the representation of  as (), 
 and therefore, 
if we define a  as 
_ () 2(^3),
then
_ ()=-8iF=-8i().
Thus as in the case of , it is easy to derive 
the following mapping rule from ():

 
If  and  correspond to 
 and  respectively,  
corresponds to , 
where the fermionic -product is defined by,
O_1O_2() 
=.()O_1()O_2( 

If  corresponds to , 
_ (O )=-8i O().
If  corresponds to ,  
corresponds to , 
where the commutator or anticommutator is taken 
according to the statistics of .  

Now we define the large- twisted reduced model
on the noncommutative superspace.
First we replace the product in () with the 
-product in the space of  
and  defined above. 
We then rewrite the action using the mapping rule given above, 
and obtain 

S_smm  & = & i^2 (2)^2 C  
                   8^2 ^*  
               (e^ e^- ) 

        & + & i (2)^2 C  8  
               ( ^ _ )
             +(W())+c.c.,
where
_ 
=-1 4 _ ^  
  e^- _ e^ , 

and  is defined by 
_ O 
=  
 .
and  is similarly defined. 
 means taking trace in the bosonic space 
of  and supertraces in the fermionic spaces of 
 and .
Here, as usual in the large- reduced model, 
the  gauge group and the bosonic noncommutative space 
are unified.
Similarly,  and  can be defined unambiguously.It is likely that by expanding () 
around a classical solution such as (), 
we can obtain a field theory on the noncommutative superspace 
where every product is defined by the combination 
of the bosonic  and fermionic  product. 
However, it does not seem straightforward to generalize 
the classical solution () to  case. 
Moreover, it is easy to find that if we expand () 
around (), () is not simply reduced to 
the ordinary noncommutative gauge theory because there appear 
terms which cannot be interpreted as a local field 
in the noncommutative field theory. Of course in the limit 
 this theory is reduced to 
the noncommutative gauge theory ().   
In the supermatrix model (), 
the chiral or antichiral condition becomes 
_ O =0,   _ O =0,
which indicate that  does not have 
 dependence or  dependence, respectively. 
It is evident by the mapping rule that  and  
in () are chiral supermatrices, 
while  is an antichiral supermatrix. 
It is also obvious by construction that in the fermionic commutative 
limit , supermatrices 
in () tend to corresponding fields in
() as follows:
& (x,), 

& (x,), 

& (x,,), 

_ & _ (x,).
Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory as the large- reduction  
 
 
In this section we show that 
the Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory can be understood in terms 
of the large- reduced model. 

To begin with, we note that the holomorphic quantities 
we have discussed in section  in the original gauge theory 
are not affected by the bosonic noncommutativity . 
These quantities carry zero external momenta, and do not have 
UV divergences. Therefore we expect that they do not depend 
on the bosonic noncommutativity
 for the reason explained in subsection .
In fact, as shown in, in the perturbative 
expansion, only the planar diagrams contribute 
to themThis fact is a consequence of the chiral ring. 
It is easy to check that this structure persists in the bosonic 
noncommutative gauge theory (). . 
It indicates that they have no dependence on ,
because the noncommutative phase factors 
cancel in planar diagrams. 
Therefore, as far as the holomorphic quantities which appears 
in the Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory are concerned, 
the same results can be obtained, even if we use the noncommutative 
version of the original theory () 
or equivalently, its large- reduced model (). 
This further implies that we can compute them 
via the supermatrix model (), 
if we take the commutative limit , 
 of the fermionic coordinates.  
In this section we discuss how to do this. 


Equivalence of the correlation function 
In order to express the correlation functions in () 
in terms of the supermatrix model (), 
we use the following simple but important equations:
x ^2 & = & 1 ^4C , 

 ^2 & = & -4.
The proof is straightforward, if we use the definitions 
x  & = & e^ik_ (^ -x^ ) , 
 
  & = & 4 e^i(^ -^ )_  ,
and take  and 
.
In the commutative limit  
of the bosonic coordinates,
the usual result in the bosonic commutative space 
 is reproduced:
^4(0)x =x ^2. 
Similarly, in the commutative limit 
of the fermionic coordinates, we have 

^2(0) = ^20,
which is the usual result in the commutative fermionic space. 
Eqs.() are quite peculiar 
to the noncommutative space which is essentially regularized 
by the noncommutativity and gives the finite result in nature.  
 From (), we can derive an identity 
(x  )^2=1.
On the other hand, if a chiral superfield  
in the bosonic noncommutative gauge theory  () 
corresponds to a chiral supermatrix  
in the supermatrix model () 
in the  limit, 
we obtain by the mapping rule 
(O x  )  

 & & d^4x' d^2 (O^(y) (x',       ^4(x'-x)^2(

 & & =  (O^(y) (x,)),   as  0, 
 

where the trace is taken over the  group. Therefore, 
in  limit, the operator 
in the left-hand side corresponds to the local field 
in (). Namely, the action 
 on a supermatrix essentially 
evaluates the corresponding field at ,  
in the noncommutative field theory side. 

In the supermatrix model (), 
a fundamental correlator is the resolvent, 
1 z-  .
Using () and (), 
we can find what kind of field in () 
corresponds to () in the  limit 
as follows:  
() 


 & & =()^2
      (x ^2 ^2) 

 & & =(^4(0)^2(0)x  
               ) 

 & & (W^(y) (x,)_ (x,) 
                          z-(x,) 
               )_*,   as  0 
 

where we have used the Konishi anomaly 
in the bosonic noncommutative space 
_0 ^4(0)^2(0)=.
In appendix , we give a derivation of this equation. 
Because , 
we thus conclude 
_0  () 
=(W^(y) (x,)_ (x,) 
                          z-(x,) 
              )_* _NC 
where the subscript  indicates the correlation function 
in the theory with the bosonic noncommutativity (). 
 
 From the point of view of the supermatrix model (), 
holomorphic quantities such as () are determined 
by the holomorphic part of the action. In particular, 
they do not depend on the kinetic term of the chiral superfield 
 (the first term) in () 
and we can neglect it in the computation of (). 
Once we do it, it is evident that 
the kinetic term of the vector superfield  (the second term) 
can be also neglected because  and  are now decoupled. 
Thus the holomorphic potential term 
S_smm ^hol =(W()),
is only the relevant term to (). 
This fact can be explicitly checked if we consider 
the Schwinger-Dyson equation for () in
() 
where the kinetic terms of  and  do not play any roles. 
Thus as far as () is concerned, we can further 
reduce the action from () to (). 

Here we make a remark about a relation between  
and the rank of the supermatrix. Suppose we represent the Heisenberg 
algebra () by the  matrix, 
where we take the large- limit at the end. Then the matrices in the 
twisted reduced model has rank . Of course, as we have seen 
in subsection , there is no notion of  and  
in the twisted reduced model itself. 
It is the background  
that brings the notion of the rank of the gauge group  and 
that of the noncommutative space  in the model.   
As is well known, from the point of view of the twisted reduced model, 
 is proportional to  as
C = (2)^D 2  ^D .

This can be seen by considering the minimal twist configuration for 
, which is the basic classical solution 
in the twisted reduced model and satisfies 
e^ia_ ^(i)  e^ia_ ^(i)  
=e^ia_ ^(i)  e^ia_ ^(i)  e^-i2 ^(i)   .
Here  is the lattice spacing,   () 
is the label of the pair of the direction subject to the twist, 
and  is the rank of the matrix . 
Therefore we have 
a^2B_ =2 _i , 
which leads to () by using . 
Eq.() can also be understood as follows. 
In the reduced model, we first fix a UV cutoff . 
A matrix with rank  describes  degrees of freedom 
because . Each degree of freedom has the mass 
dimension 1 as seen from () and 
has a volume  in the momentum space 
due to (), which effectively gives the IR cutoff. 
Thus we get 
^DB , 
which is consistent with (). In the large- limit, 
the volume of each degree of freedom in the momentum space 
becomes small, and therefore the IR cutoff 
in the momentum space tends to zero. 
This agrees with the remark we made in subsection  
that it is the high energy region much larger than  
that the description by the large- field theory becomes good. 

On the other hand, as we have explained in subsection , 
in the low energy region much smaller than , 
the description via the noncommutative field theory becomes good 
in the sense that it is well approximated by its commutative limit. 
In this case, the noncommutativity 
in the coordinate space brings an effective UV cutoff, 
and it is convenient to consider in the coordinate space. 
In order to go to the description by the noncommutative field theory, 
we have taken the background , 
and expanded the theory around it. 
Then our space-time consists of  (not ) unit cells
of volume . 
Therefore the total volume  is given by 

VC  n . 


Turning back to our model (), this observation 
leads us to define
where we have introduced a formal parameter  
with the mass dimension 3 on the dimensional grounds, 
and have used () because 
we are now at the standpoint of the matrix model. Various factors 
such as  have been absorbed 
in the definition of , and () becomes 
S_smm ^hol =(W()). 
We can start from this action, 
and compute the  limit 
of the resolvent 
() .
As a matter of fact, the  
dependence disappears, if we express the resolvent in terms of 
's constructed from (), 
which indicates that the result has no explicit dependence on 
,  and . It can be checked directly 
by considering the Schwinger-Dyson equation for () 
in the one-supermatrix model (). 
Therefore, we can take the commutative limit  
of () to obtain 
() 
=(W^ (x,)W_ (x,) 
                          z-(x,) 
              ) ,
where the correlation function in the right-hand side is 
the one in the original gauge theory (). 
This argument supports the observation given at the beginning 
of this section. There, we have noted that the holomorphic quantities 
without UV divergence in the Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory are not influenced 
by the bosonic noncommutativity  from the point of view 
given in subsection  or, more explicitly, from that of 
the perturbation theory. 
Thus we establish the equivalence 
between the resolvent () of the one-supermatrix model 
() and the correlation function 
in the right-hand side of eq.() 
in the supersymmetric gauge theory (). 
This is nothing but the Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory, except that 
we should consider the one-supermatrix model 
rather than the ordinary Hermitian one-matrix model. 
Later we will discuss this point in more detail. 
In fact, it is pointed out in 
that the effective superpotential of the gauge theory 
can be computed by a supermatrix model.  
Note that we have seen the Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory by constructing 
a direct mapping () 
between the correlators of the gauge theory and the supermatrix model, 
instead of comparing the formal structures 
of the Schwinger-Dyson equation. 


Equivalence of the free energy 
In this section we show that 
in the limit , 
the free energy of the supermatrix model () 
becomes the prepotential of the original gauge theory 
(). 

We define the free energy of the supermatrix model () by 
(-^2 g_m^2 F_m )
=(-(W())).
It is easy to check that  is equal to
the the holomorphic part of the free energy  
of the large- reduced model ()
(-^2 g_m^2 F_smm )  
  
& = & d^N^2 
       (- (^ _ )
                          +(W())). 
 

Here we have omitted the kinetic term and the anti-holomorphic term
from (), because they do not contribute to the
holomorphic part of the free energy due to the holomorphy. 
Then  and  are decoupled from each other, 
and the integration over  
can be performed to yield just a constant. 
Thus we obtain . 
Here we make a remark on the decoupling of . 
In the supermatrix model ()
with , the
holomorphic part of the free energy  has no UV divergence,
even if we turn off the kinetic term. 
And once we do so, 
it is evident that  is decoupled from . 
On the other hand, in the  limit, 
we have () or (), 
in which the holomorphic part of the free energy becomes
UV divergent if we drop the kinetic term,
and we should introduce a regularization if we want to do so.
In other words, the kinetic term plays the role of the regularization.
And in general it is possible that a regularization induces a 
coupling between  and ,
which is universal in the sense that it does not depend on the detail
of the regularization scheme. 
We can see that this is indeed the case in (), 
where the operators that consist of  are affected 
by the Konishi anomaly () in the  limit. 
In fact, as shown in (), 
the left-hand side of () is finite when . 
However in the  limit it needs some regularization 
which is the origin of the noncommutative Konishi anomaly 
() as we show in appendix . 
This is also the case when we consider correlation functions. 
When we compute correlation functions of holomorphic quantities 
such as the resolvent () in the supermatrix model 
(), it is sufficient to consider 
the simplified supermatrix model (). 
However, when we take  limit, 
we should take account of the Konishi anomaly in
() and (). In fact, 
eq.() prescribes how it appears 
in the correlation function in the  limit 
in these theories. 
  
It immediately follows from () and () 
that 
F_m  g_k 
=F_smm  g_k  
=1 k+1 ^k+1  . 
As shown in section , 
the prepotential  in the original gauge theory () 
satisfies 

_g_k  
=1 k+1 (W^ W_ ^k+1 ) .
Because in () we have shown directly the equivalence 
between the generating functions of () 
and (), we find 
F_m  g_k 
=_g_k .
More precisely, 
 is a function of  and  where  
is defined by 
S_i=1 2i _C_i dz
    W^ W_  z-  .
 From () we find that this quantity is expressed 
by the matrix model as 
S_i=1 2i _C_i dz
    () =g_m _i  , 
 

where  is the number of eigenvalues of  
near the  critical point. Note that in our supermatrix model, 
 can take negative values,
on which we will make some comments in the next subsection. 
We emphasize that we have shown () as an identity. 
 and  
are the same quantity. The only difference is the way 
they are represented.

In addition to this correspondence, 
we have a rather unconventional relation.
Because we have derived 
, 
we can obtain the effective potential, or free energy 
of the noncommutative gauge theory () 
directly from the free energy  of the matrix model 
() by taking the  limit. 
Moreover, the effective potential of () is independent 
of the bosonic noncommutativity  as shown 
at the beginning of this section. It is hence the same 
as that of the commutative theory (). 
Therefore we obtain the following relation between
the effective potential  in the original gauge theory 
() and the free energy  of 
the simplified supermatrix model ():

(- W_eff )
=(-^2 g_m^2  F_m). 

Returning to the original noncommutativities (), we find  
 W_eff =()^2 F_m, 
 

which seems different from the claim of the Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory
F =F_m.
Somehow the naive use of the mapping rule gives not () but
(). 
This suggests that
 is related to  in an unconventional way 
through . 
It would be interesting to clarify the meaning of this relation. 
 


Supermatrix versus bosonic matrix  
 
In this subsection we discuss how the supermatrix model 
we have obtained () is reconciled with 
the Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory, 
where the ordinary Hermitian matrix model is considered. 

Let us start with a general discussion on supermatrix. 
A Hermitian supermatrix  is defined to have the following form: 

array cc 
              B_1 & F_1 

              F_1^  & B_2 
             
      ),
      

where  and  are  and  
Hermitian matrices with Grassmann even entries, respectively, 
and  is an  complex matrix with Grassmann odd entries. 
And the supertrace is defined by 
()= B_1- B_2.

We then consider the Hermitian supermatrix model given by 
S= g_m (W()),

where . Using the  symmetry, we can diagonalize 
 as 
 
(   
)U.

Then by rewriting () in terms of the eigenvalues 
, we obtain 
the effective action for eigenvalues
S_eff = g_m _i=1 ^n W(_i)
       - g_m _j=1 ^m W(_j)
       -_i<j (_i-_j)^2
       -_i<j (_i-_j)^2
       +_i,j (_i-_j)^2.
Note that the sign of the second and last terms are opposite 
to the ordinary Hermitian one-matrix model. 
The former is due to the supertrace, while the latter due to 
fermionic measures. Using the 
eigenvalue densities for  and  

()=1 n _i=1 ^n (()=1 m _j=1 ^m (we can rewrite this action as 
S_eff  & = & n g_m d ()W()
             -m g_m d  ()W() 

        & - & n^2 2 dd              ()(              (

        & - & m^2 2 dd              ()(

        & + & nmdd 
              ()()(If we introduce the 'total' eigenvalue density defined by 

_0()=n  ()-m  (),
we can further rewrite  as
S_eff =^2 g_m d _0()W()
       -^2 2 dd              _0()_0(              (which is nothing but the effective action of eigenvalues 
of the ordinary Hermitian one-matrix model with the potential .
 
In this sense, we can consider the ordinary Hermitian 
matrix model () 
instead of (), which agrees with the 
Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory. However, in the Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory 
one should formally consider the eigenvalues which lie 
around the top of the potential. From the point of view 
of the ordinary matrix model, this is nothing but introducing 
a 'negative density' of eigenvalues, which seems unnatural,
although it is formally a solution of
the Schwinger-Dyson equations.
On the other hand, this problem does not exist in the supermatrix 
model (). 
Namely, suppose that eigenvalues around a bottom of 
the potential are regarded as those of  
( in ()), while eigenvalues 
around a top of the potential as those of  
(-type in ()). Then, due to the property of 
the supertrace, the eigenvalue density for the latter naturally 
appears in  with negative sign as we have seen 
in (). 
This corresponds to introducing a density with indefinite sign 
from the viewpoint of the ordinary matrix model 
as in (). Note here that in the supermatrix model 
the eigenvalue density  itself introduced 
in () 
is a positive, well-defined function. This tempts us to conclude 
that the glueball superpotential in the original gauge theory 
is described by the one-supermatrix model () 
instead of () in a rigorous sense. 

However, our supermatrix model () seems to have
the following difficulty.
If we represent the noncommutative fermionic space 
in terms of Pauli matrices as in (), 
the first and the second block of  should have the same size,
that is,  in ().
Then from () we find that 
only the restricted domain where  
can be described in this case. 
This drawback might originate 
from the too simple choice of the fermionic noncommutativity 
() or the representation (). 
Another possibility is that some of the eigenvalues might be 
considered to lie at infinity. 
Note that in the Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory, the extrema of the potential 
at infinity play no role if no eigenvalues lie around them.  
In this sense, there is indeed an ambiguity in the limiting procedure 
of the potential in the corresponding matrix model. 
It might be possible that 
if we take account of the kinetic term and the other terms, 
we can fix this ambiguity, and some eigenvalues are considered to 
be around the extrema at infinity. 
If this is the case, we can realize an arbitrary distribution 
of eigenvalues as a subset of the total distribution 
even if the total  satisfies . 
In any case, it would be important to examine how we should generalize 
our supermatrix model so that it can describe more 
generic distributions of eigenvalues. We believe that 
the supermatrix model has a definite meaning, 
because it naturally arises in the mapping from the gauge theory 
to the matrix model. 




Discussions 
Although we have understood essential part of the Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory 
in terms of the large- reduced model, some issues still remain 
to be clarified. 

In the Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory, the prepotential plays an 
important role in constructing the effective potential. 
In the context of the field theory, it can be understood as a result of 
the decoupling of the overall  part. 
However, from the point of view of the large- reduced model, 
it seems difficult to separate the  part and find  matrix variables 
that correspond to such fields as 
w_ =1 4  W_ .

In this sense, in the matrix model, the symmetry 
 can not be expressed manifestly. 
In fact, in Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory, it is conjectured that 

which we have not yet shown in the matrix model context. 
Although we can prove it for the  dependent part (),
the reason for the full coincidence is still unclear, and   
our naive argument gives () 
instead of (). 
It would be an interesting problem to see how 
these structures of the  supersymmetry are hidden 
in the reduced model.  

As we commented at the end of subsection , 
the apparent drawback of our supermatrix model is that it cannot 
describe arbitrary eigenvalue distributions. It is natural to expect 
that if we consider a more general noncommutative superspace
we will have a supermatrix model in which the first and the second 
blocks have different sizes. 
It would be important to deepen our understanding 
of the gauge theory on a noncommutative superspace. 

As for a generalization of our model, several directions can be 
anticipated; inclusion of a matter in the fundamental representation 
, other gauge groups, higher supersymmetries, and so on.  
It is expected that such generalizations help us to understand 
a generic structure of gauge theories 
on the noncommutative superspace, 
or supersymmetric twisted reduced models. 

In light of the ordinary twisted reduced model discussed in 
, our supermatrix model () 
is still unsatisfactory, because it has a dependence on the 
fermionic background . In order to make 
our model background-independent, it is necessary 
to introduce a gauge field associated with . 
It would clarify the meaning of the fermionic noncommutativity 
 as a regularization, and of the Konishi anomaly 
on the noncommutative space. It would be also a clue to 
resolve the problem on the supertrace mentioned above.

Noncommutative Konishi anomaly 
In this appendix we derive the noncommutative Konishi anomaly 
() on the bosonic noncommutative space. 

We consider the noncommutative gauge theory (). 
As explained in section , the Konishi anomaly can be 
regarded as 
^i(x,) ^j(x',=^i _j ^4(x-x')^2(=^i _j x,x',in the limit  and . 
We should evaluate this in a gauge invariant way, and 
in order to do this, we use the covariant Laplacian 
given by 
_cov =1 16 ^2e^-V *D^2e^V *,
where  is the vector superfield. 
It is easy to check that 
() indeed transforms covariantly under the 
gauge transformation. In the  limit, it becomes 
the ordinary Laplacian. () can be also derived 
by adding the mass term of the antichiral superfield 
 to () 
and performing the Gaussian integration 
with respect to . We evaluate 
 by the heat kernel method as follows:
x,x,  
 & = & _0 d^4k        x,_*(_cov )k,       k,x,
  
 & = & _0 4 
       (_*(_cov )e_*^ikx+i )
                                   e_*^-ikx-i , 
 
 & = & _0 4
       _* 16 
       ( -16k^2-^2^2-8iW . 

 &   & . -4ik_ ^ ^2 
              +^2e^-V *D^2e^V+16k_ W^       ).
Next we expand the exponential. First we note that 
if we use  or  
in one of the factors in the expansion, it vanishes because 
at least one  acts on the other factors which are chiral. 
Thus we can drop these terms in the exponential. 
Due to the integration with respect to , it is sufficient 
to consider the terms which contain two 's in the expansion 
of the exponential. However, it is easy to see 
that if such terms contain , they yield positive power of  
after the integration with respect to  and hence vanish 
in the  limit. 
Therefore, a nonvanishing contribution comes only from 
_0 4 
e^-k^2 ^2 2 (-i 2 W)^2_* 
=W^ *W_ . 

Obviously this result is valid also in the commutative limit 
.
