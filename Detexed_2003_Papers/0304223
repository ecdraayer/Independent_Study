We provide a method and the results  for the calculation of  the holonomy of a Yang-Mills connection in 
an  arbitrary triangular path, in an expansion (developed here to fifth order) in powers of the corresponding 
segments. The results might have applications in generalizing to Yang-Mills fields previous calculations  of  
the corrections to particle dynamics induced by loop quantum gravity,  as well as in the field of random lattices.

Introduction 


Constraints in  Lorentz covariance violations have been experimentally studied since a
long time ago
 by obtaining observational bounds upon the violating parameters. Recent experiments have shown an impressive increase in their sensitivities  thus producing even more stringent bounds.

In order to correlate such experimental results, Kostelecky and collaborators
have proposed a phenomenological extension of the standard model,
which incorporates the most general Lorentz-violating interactions compatible with power counting renormalizability together with the particle structure of the standard model. An impressive  number of applications to very different processes have been already considered,
as can be seen in Ref., for example.

Different models accounting for minute Lorentz violations have recently arisen in
the context
of quantum gravity induced corrections to the propagation and interactions of
particles. This amounts to  realize the generic violating
parameters appearing in the standard model
extension in terms of specific quantities involving the Planck length  together with additional  physically relevant objects. Moreover, the high precision  obtained in the
determination of the experimental bounds has brought  quantum gravity
induced effects to the level of observable phenomena.

On the other hand, in the early 80's, the growing importance of computer simulations of gauge theories
required a short distance cutoff of geometrical origin such as a lattice. However regular lattices
break essential symmetries of continuum theories such as translational and rotational invariance.
Motivated by the need of maintaining these symmetries, the field theory on a random lattice was suggested
. Further on, the connection of random lattices with quantum gravity and strings
was studied and low dimensional systems on random lattices were solved using
matrix model techniques.

In this work we concentrate on some aspects arising in the process of generalizing
the loop quantum gravity inspired model described
in  to Yang-Mills fields, in order to obtain  the non-Abelian generalization of the
corrections previously found for the dynamics of
photons. Namely, corrections to standard matter dynamics are obtained by means of calculating non-Abelian holonomies, either of gravitational or Yang-Mills type, around triangular paths. To this end
we have to revise  and extend the procedure of Ref. that was applied to the case of rectangular cells.
It turns out that the method we present in this paper contains as a particular case
the result of Ref., though it is applicable to arbitrary cells made up of triangles.
The basic building block in our analysis is the holonomy along a straight line
segment which path order property we consistently keep to all orders in our expansion.

The problem we deal with here is closely related to the non Abelian Stokes theorem which has been repeatedly
discussed in the literature.


This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we state the problem to be dealt with and introduce some 
notation. Section 3 summarizes  the results for the Abelian case which we intend to generalize here. 
The non-Abelian case is  subsequently discussed in Section 4 which contains our main results. 
Using the procedure  of Ref. the corresponding calculation  is performed in Section 5, 
which allows us to show some discrepancies  that arise  between the two methods. Finally we close with  
a summary and discussion in Section 6. For the sake of completeness we have included some intermediate 
steps of the
calculations in  Appendices A and B.

Part of the computations involved in deriving the results of section 4 and 5 were done using FORM.

Statement of the problem 

The proposed method to obtain the quantum gravity induced corrections to the Yang-Mills Lagrangian
requires the calculation of the object
 
where  are the generators of the corresponding Lie algebra and  is the holonomy of the Yang-Mills connection  in the triangle , with vertex  , defined
by the vectors  and , arising from the vertex  in the way described below.

 Our  main task will be to construct an expansion of  in powers of the segments 
.

To be more precise, we have
h __IJ  =Pexp(__IJ   A _a(x (s))dx^a ds ds ),
where  is a path-ordered product to be specified later.
As shown in Fig.1, the closed path , parameterized by , is defined in the following  way: we start from the vertex  following a straight line with the direction and length of , then follow another straight line in the direction and length of , and finally return to  following . From the definition of the holonomy, we have the transformation property
h __IJ  U (v)h __IJ  U (v)^-1 ,
under a gauge transformation of the connection, where  is a group element evaluated at the vertex . In other words,   transforms covariantly under the group.



The Abelian case 

The corresponding calculation was performed in Ref. and 
here we summarize the results in order to have the
correct expressions to which the non-Abelian result must reduce when taking the commuting limit. In this case 
Eq.() reduces to
T=exp(_IJ )-1 ,
where  is the magnetic flux through the area of the triangle, given by
 
where the connection  is now a commuting object.

The basic building block in () is
 
with
. The infinite series in parenthesis is
 
yielding
_v  _1  ^v  _2  A  _a (x  
)dx^a =F(^a _a )( ^a A  
_a (v  _1 )) . In the following we employ the notation 
. Using the above result in the three
integrals appearing in () and after some algebra, we obtain
 
where the gradient acts upon the coordinates of . The function 
 is F_1 (x,y)=y(e ^x -1)-x(e ^y -1) xy(y-x) 
=-_n=1 ^ 1 (n+1)! x^n -y^n  x-y . Let us emphazise
that  is just a power series in the variables  and . Expanding in powers of the
 segments  we obtain
 
Notice that the combination
1 2 s_I ^a s_J ^b _abc =A n_c ,
is just the oriented area of the triangle with vertex  and sides 
, joining at this vertex, having value  and unit
normalvector.

To conclude we have to calculate
 (
e^  ^B (F_IJ ()) -1) &=& _n=2 ^ 
1 n!  (  ^B (F_IJ ))^n= _n=2 ^ 
M_nIJ() ,
where the subindex  labels the corresponding power in the vectors . 
The results are
M_2IJ() &:=&  s^a_I s^b_J 1 2!   F _ab , 

M_3IJ() &:=& s^a_I s^b_J 1 3!  (x_I+x_J)  F _ab , 

M_4IJ() &:=&s^a_I s^b_J  1 4!  (x_I^2+x_Ix_J+x_J^2)  F _ab 
+ s^a_I s^b_Js^c_Is^d_J 1 8   F _ab                                  F _cd ,

M_5IJ() :&=&1 5! (x_I^3+x_J^3+x_I^2x_J+x_Ix_J^2)s_I^as_J^b F_ab 

 
&&+ s^a_I s^b_Js^c_I s^d_J 4! [(x_I+x_J)F _ab F _cd +F _ab (x_I+x_J)F _cd ]
up to fifth order. We are using the notation 
.

We expect that the non-Abelian generalization of the  quantities (), (), (), () is produced by the replacement
&& A_a A _a=A^_aG_, _a D _a=
_a-[A _a ,    ] 

&& F_ab  F _ab =
 _aA _b-_bA _a-[A _a, A _b]
Nevertheless, at this level there are potential ordering ambiguities which will be resolved in the next sections.

The non-Abelian case 

In a similar way to the Abelian case we separate the calculation of the holonomy  in three basic pieces through the straight lines along the sides of the triangle . We have
h  __IJ  =P(e^L_3 )P(e^L_2 )P(e^L_1 )U_3U_2U_1,

where
&&L_1=_0^ 1 dt A  _a(v  + t  s _I) s^a_I

&&L_2=_0^ 1 dt A  _a(v + s _I + t  (s _J-s _I))(s^a_J-s^a_I)

&&L_3=_0^ 1 dt A  _a(v + s _J - t  s _J)(- s^a_J)
Here we have parameterized each segment with .

The basic building block 

Let us consider in detail the contribution
U_1=P(e^L_1 ), L_1=_0^ 1 dt A  _a(v  + t  s_I ) s_I^a,
with .

Using the  definition
 
for the path ordering, we arrive at the following expression
 
Here we are using  the conventions
 
with   given by Eq.().
The notation in Eq. () is that  each operator
  acts only in the corresponding field  respectively.
We write
U_1=_N U_1 ^(N) ,
where the superindex   indicates the powers of  contained in each term. A detailed calculation produces
 
 
 
Specializing to the case  and to third order in  we obtain
U_1 =1+aA _1 +1 2 a^2 (_1 A _1 +A _1 ^2 )+1 3! a^3 (^2 _1 A _1 +A _1 _1 A _1 
+2(_1 A _1 )A _1 + A _1^3).
Next we compare our result () with the calculation according to the method of Ref.. Using the equation (3.15a) of such reference  for    we obtain
 
which does not agree with the expression (). This basic discrepancy propagates when combining more segments and ultimately it is the source of  the differences between our results and those obtained via the application of the methods in Ref..

It is interesting to remark that in  the Abelian limit both () and () reduce to
U_1 =1+a A _1 +1 2 a^2 (_1  A _1 + A _1 ^2 )+1 3! a^3 (^2 _1  A _1 + 3 A _1 _1  A _1  + A_1^3)
which is obtained from a direct calculation using the expression ().



The holonomy   

Now we put the remaining pieces together in order to calculate  . Using the notation
y=s^a_J_a
and starting from the basic structure () we obtain, mutatis mutandis,


 
for , together with
 
for . Let us emphasize that in all the expressions above for ,  and , the connection is evaluated at the vertex . The bars only serve to indicate the position in which the corresponding  derivative acts.

Next we write the contributions to  the holonomy in powers of the segments. Some further details are presented in the Appendix A. We obtain
h  __IJ  ^(2) =1 2 s_I ^a s_J ^b  F _ab ,
 

 


 


Eq. () resolves the ordering ambiguity which apparently arised in covariantizing the first term in the RHS of Eq.(). Nevertheless, as we subsequently show there is really no such ambiguity at this order. Let us consider the combination
s_I ^a s^b _J s_I ^c s^d _J  (  D _c D _d -  D _d D _c )F _ab &=&s_I ^a s^b _J s_I ^c s^d _J  [ D _c ,  D _d ]F _ab 

&=&-s_I ^a s^b _J s_I ^c s^d _J  [ F _cd ,F _ab  ]=[F  ,F  ]=0
where we have used the notation  together with the property
[ D _c ,  D _d ]G =-[F _cd ,G  ]
valid for any object  in the adjoint representation.

The results (), () ,  () and (), which we have obtained by direct calculation, constitute in fact the unique gauge covariant generalization of the corresponding Abelian expressions
(), (),  () and (). This provides a strong support to our method of calculation.

 The holonomy according to the method of Ref.[16] 


In this section we calculate the holonomy  using the method of Ref. adapted for our case of three segments: . From Eqs. (3.1),  (3.3), (3.4), (3.12) and (3.14), with ,  of that reference it follows that
  
The basic building blocks are
 
where the vertex  generalizes de point  in the notation of
. The calculational method indicated in Eqs.() and () is clearly not equivalent to the correct prescription ():  with
the 's given by Eq.() together with the corresponding extensions that take into account the change of the starting point in the corresponding path. 

Let us write here those expressions arising from the method in Ref. that we will use in our calculation
&=&L_1 +L_2 +L_3 , 

2!F_2 &=&[(L_3 +L_2 ), L_1 ]+[L_3 ,L_2 ], 

3!F_3 &=&-[,F_2 ]+[(L_3 +L_2 )^2  L_1 ]+[L_3 ^2 L_2 ], 

4!F_4 &=&-3![,F_3 ]-[^2 F_2 ]+[(L_3 +L_2 )^3  L_1 ]+[L_3 ^3 L_2 ]
with the notation   and so on.

Expanding each segment in powers of the vectors , which number is denoted by the superindex, leads to (up to fourth order)
 
L^(3) _2 &=&1 3! [(s^b _J s^c _J +s^b _J s^c _I +s^b _I s^c _I )(s^a _J -s^a _I )]_b _c A _a 

L_2^(4) &=& 1 4! (s_I ^d s_I ^b s_I ^c +s_J ^d s_J ^b s_J ^c +s_I ^d s_I ^b s_J ^c +s_I ^d s_J ^b s_J ^c ) (s_J ^a -s_I ^a )       _d_c_bA_a
 
L^(3) _3 &=&-1 3! s^c _J s^b _J s^a _J _b _c A _a , L_3^(4) = -1 4! s_J ^d  s_J ^c s_J ^b  s_J ^a _d_c_bA_a
Next we write the contributions to  in powers of the segments. The details are shown in the Appendix B. The first order contribution  vanishes and the remaining contributions are
 
 
with
 
and finally
 
with
 

 

The reader can verify that the terms ,       are not covariant under the gauge group, as it should be expected from the definition of the path-ordering. This property has to be preserved at each order in the expansion in powers of the segments.

Summary and discussion 

We have calculated the holonomy  of the Yang-Mills connection  in the triangle  with vertex  and sides ,  joining at that vertex, as shown in Fig. (1). Our results, to fifth order in the segments, are given in Eqs.
() () () and () of section 4. The direct calculation shows that, to fourth order, the results are directly given by the replacement 
 in the corresponding formulas for the Abelian case. This is so because, as explained at the end of section 4, the potential order ambiguity in the fourth order term is absent. From the fifth order on such ordering ambiguities arise, so that  is not possible to guess the correct answer from the Abelian case. Clearly then, one has to perform the full calculation in order  to obtain the correct result. 

In section 5 the same  calculation was  performed using the method of Ref..
The results for the triangle coincide to second order and start to differ from the third order on. This difference can be traced back to that arising in the calculation of the holonomy for a straight-line segment according to Eqs. () and (), which the reader can easily verify. Contrary to what is expected, the calculation according to the method of Ref. produces non-covariant contributions to third and fourth order, given in Eqs. () and (), (), respectively.

The specific results presented in Ref. correspond to the  calculation of the holonomy for a rectangle of sides   and , respectively. Using the method described in section 4 we have verified that, up to fourth order, the result given in Eq. (3.19) of that reference is correct.

Nevertheless, since the calculational method of Ref. does not properly take into account the path ordering, it is not possible to guarantee the multiplicative composition law of holonomies. In fact, one might think of  obtaining the holonomy for the rectangle by composing the results of properly chosen triangles. Even though, as commented above, one should not expect to obtain the correct result we have explored this possibility.
To this end let us consider a quadrilateral   with vertex  at the point , as shown in Fig. (2). The sides  and  are parallel, but  and  are not. We are interested in calculating the holonomy for the path  as indicated in Fig. (2). This can be done by composing, via matrix multiplication, the holonomies corresponding to the triangles  (spanned by the vectors , ) and  (spanned by the vectors , ), each of which is calculated according to
expressions (),() and (), together with their corresponding 's. In other words,


 
 

Triangle  with vertex   






 
 

Quadrilateral   with vertex  at the point   







h _ABCDA =h _ACDA h _ABCA .
We introduce the further notation in the plane of the quadrilateral
&&AB  =s _I= (a,0), AC  =s _J= (a',b),

&&AC  = s   _I = (a',b), AD  = s   _J = (a",b),
We only pay attention to the non-covariant contributions. To third order they just add up and we obtain
 
We see that the above is not zero in general. Nevertheless, in the  symmetrical case of  a
parallelepiped, characterized by the condition
a"-a'+a=0,
the non-covariant piece () vanishes. Of course, the above condition includes that of a rectangle which is   y   .

Nevertheless, the failure of the composition property of the calculational method in Ref. is illustrated at the fourth order where one should have a cancelation among each of the corresponding pieces  and  The simplest symmetrical case corresponds to   and leads to
