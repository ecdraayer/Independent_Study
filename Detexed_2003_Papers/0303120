We investigate quantum corrections in non-commutative gauge theory on fuzzy
sphere. We study translation invariant models which
classically favor a single fuzzy sphere with  gauge group.
We evaluate the effective actions up to the two loop level.
We find non-vanishing quantum corrections at each order
even in supersymmetric models.
It is consistent with the fact that
there is no unbroken supersymmetry in de-Sitter space.
In particular the two loop contribution favors
 gauge group over  contrary to the tree action
in a deformed IIB matrix model with a Myers term.
We further observe close correspondences to 2 dimensional quantum gravity.
Introduction 
Matrix models are a promising approach to understand
non-perturbative aspects of superstring/M-theory.
In this approach, space-time and matter fields may emerge
from matrix degrees of freedom.
A well-known prototype of such a possibility is the following
non-commutative D-brane solutions in the
large  limit
&&A^cl _1=p ,  A^cl _2=q ,&&[p ,q ]=-i .
Non-commutative (NC) gauge theory is obtained from matrix models
around such solutions.
In string theory, NC gauge theory on flat space is realized with
constant  field.
NC gauge theory exhibits UV-IR mixing which is
a characteristic feature of string theory.
The advantage of matrix model construction of NC gauge theory
is that it maintains the manifest gauge invariance under
 transformations
A_  UA_ U^  .
The gauge invariant observables of NC gauge theory,
the Wilson lines were constructed through matrix
models.
In bosonic string theory, they are the emission vertex operators for
the entire closed string modes.

To further elucidate the dynamics of the matrix models
for superstring/M-theory,
it may be useful to investigate matrix models on homogeneous
spaces.
Experimentally it is now very likely that we live
in a homogeneous space, namely de-Sitter space.
A homogeneous space is realized as 
where  is a Lie group and  is a closed subgroup of .
NC gauge theories on homogeneous spaces are realized by matrix models.
In string theory, they may appear with non-constant
 field.
It is an interesting problem on its own to
study NC gauge theories on curved manifolds.

We have formulated a general procedure to construct
fuzzy homogeneous spaces  in.
We first consider a representation of  which contains
a (highest weight) state which is invariant under  modulo
a local gauge group.
We also require that fuzzy  where  is the dimension of 
is realized in the local patch around such a state.
We are thus restricted to symplectic manifolds. It is because
the  product on such a manifold can be
reduced to that of a flat manifold (Moyal product) locally by choosing
the Darboux coordinates.
Since the Ka hler form serves as the symplectic form,
Ka hler manifolds such as  satisfy this requirement.

We embed the Lie generators of  into
 dimensional Hermitian matrices where  is the
dimension of the representation.
The gauge fields on fuzzy  are constructed as bi-local fields.
The bi-local fields are the tensor products
of the relevant representation and the complex conjugate of it.
Since they are reducible, we can decompose them into the irreducible
representations.
They are guaranteed to form the complete basis of 
Hermitian matrices by construction.


In this paper we investigate quantum aspects of
matrix models on fuzzy  up to the two loop level.
Although  has been chosen for simplicity, it may be
possible to draw implications for generic homogeneous spaces
from it.
We can address such physically interesting questions
as the SUSY breaking effects
and correspondences to quantum gravity in a concrete setting.


Let us briefly summarize the basic facts of fuzzy .
 is a homogeneous space since .
In , we have the Hermitian operators
 which satisfy the commutation relations
of the angular momentum:
[j _x,j _y]=ij _z .
Contrary to  case, such a commutation relation
can be realized with finite size matrices
since  is compact.
The raising and lowering operators  can be formed from
 which satisfy
&&j ^ =12  (j _xij _y),&&[j ^+,j ^-]=j _z ,
  [j _z, j ^ ]=j ^  .
Let us adopt an  dimensional
representation of spin .
We further consider the semiclassical limit where  is assumed to be
large.
For the localized states around the north pole,
we can approximate .
By rescaling the operators, we obtain the following
commutation relations from (),
&&a =1l  j ^+,
 a ^ =1l  j ^-,
 1 =1l j _z&&[a ,a ^ ] = 1 ,
  [1 ,a ]=1l a ,
  [1 ,a ^ ]=-1l a ^  .
Since we obtain the identical algebra with fuzzy ,
flat fuzzy plane is locally realized.
Note that the radius of  is 
after fixing the non-commutativity scale to be 1.

The gauge fields are constructed as the bi-local fields.
They are the tensor product of the spin  representations
l  l 
=_j=0 ^2l   j  .
From the above decomposition, we can see that
a group of representations with spins up to 
form the complete basis of  Hermitian matrices.

The organization of this paper is as follows.
We investigate quantum effects in NC gauge theory
on fuzzy sphere through matrix models in section 2.
We summarize our results up to the two loop level
and discuss their physical implications.
In section 3, we evaluate the 2 loop effective action
in detail.
We conclude in section 4 with discussions.

Quantum effects in matrix models 

NC gauge theories on compact homogeneous spaces
can be constructed through matrix models.
A minimal model which realizes NC gauge theories
on fuzzy sphere is constructed in.
It is a reduced super Yang-Mills theory in 3d
with a Myers term:
S=Tr(-14 [A_ ,A_ ][A_ ,A_ ]+
i3 f^ [A_ ,A_ ]A_ 
+12  ^ [A_ ,]) ,
where  and  are  Hermitian matrices.
 is a two component Majorana spinor field
and  are Pauli matrices.
The action is invariant under the following supersymmetry:
&&A_  = i _ ,&&= i2 ([A_ ,A_ ]-
if_ A_ )
^ .
We can also deform IIB matrix model in an analogous way
S_IIB S_IIB +
i3  f_ Tr[A_ ,A_ ]A_  ,
where  is the structure constant of a compact Lie group .
The perturbation term may represent non-constant  field
.
Since there are 10 Hermitian matrices  in IIB matrix model,
the number of the Lie generators of  cannot exceed 10 in this
construction.
Although this model no longer preserves SUSY, it
possesses many similarities to
() when .
Although it is possible to construct a deformed IIB matrix
model with SUSY when ,
fuzzy  solutions break SUSY at the classical level in that
model. 

Since these models possess the translation invariance
A_ A_ +c_ 
and also
+,
we remove these zero-modes by restricting  and 
to be traceless.

The equation of motion is
[A_ ,[A_ ,A_ ]]+i f_ [A_ ,A_ ]=0 .
The nontrivial classical solution is
A_ ^cl = t^ ,
  other  A_ ^cl  =0 ,
where 's satisfy the Lie algebra of .

We consider the following classical solution for  case.
A_ ^cl =f j_ 1_nn  ,
  A^cl _i =0 ,
where  are angular momentum operators
in the spin  representation and  denotes
the orthogonal directions to the 3 dimensional space in which  resides.
The fixed parameters of the matrix models are  (the dimension of the
matrices) and  (the coefficient of the Myers term).
Since different  gauge groups could be realized
as long as  is divisible by , gauge groups
are dynamically determined in the matrix models.
The classical action associated with this solution is
-f^46 nl(l+1)(2l+1) .
For a large but fixed , the irreducible representation
of spin  is selected by
minimizing the classical action.


In the large  limit, the fuzzy  may be realized locally
as we recalled it in the preceding section.
The local momenta are introduced as .
We expand the action around the classical solution as

.
In this paragraph,  denotes the tangential directions to 
while  denotes the transverse directions to it.
Here we have fixed the non-commutativity scale
to be 1.
After using the Moyal-Weyl correspondence,
&&a a(x),&&a b a(x)* b(x),&&Tr(12 )d^2x tr,
we obtain the following NC gauge theory from ()
&&-f^4 l^2(12 )d^2x
tr(14 [D_ ,D_ ]^2
+12 [D_ ,_i]^2
+14 [_i,_j]^2.&&.+12  _ [D_ ,]
+12  _i [_i,] )_*  .
 denotes the trace operation over  gauge group.
The Chern-Simons terms are suppressed by .
In this way, we identify the coupling constant of NC gauge theory
at the non-commutativity scale as
g^2_NC_2 =2(1lf^2 )^2.
The classical action () is  for a finite gauge coupling
-2nl3g_NC ^2 -2N6g_NC ^2  .
In order to obtain a finite gauge coupling , we need to choose
.
Since we find  in 2 dimensions, we need to let 
vanish in the large  limit as .
From (), we can see that SUSY is locally recovered
in this limit.


In order to obtain NC gauge theory,
we expand the matrices around the classical solution:
A_ =f (j_ +a_ ),
  A_i =f _i  (i=17),
  f^32 .
Here we have separated bosonic fluctuations into vector (triplet)
 and scalar (singlet)  fields.
After this procedure, the action () becomes
&&f^4 Tr
[ -14 
(L_  a_ -L_ 
a_ +[a_ ,a_ ])^2
-12 
(L_ _i+[a_ ,_i])^2
-14 [_i,_j]^2 . &&+.i2 _ 
(L_  a_ -L_  a_ )a_ 
+i3 _ 
[a_ , a_ ]a_   .&&.+
12 
 ^ (L_ +[a_ ,])
+12  ^i [_i,]
] .
where .

After the gauge fixing,
the bosonic quadratic action is simply given by
f^42 
Tr(a _ L^2a _ 
+_iL^2_i
) .
 is the Laplacian on fuzzy 
which acts on matrix spherical harmonics  as
L^2Y_jm =j(j+1)Y_jm  .
In our matrix model,  is constrained as .
We thus expand bosonic quantum fluctuations in terms of  dimensional
matrix spherical harmonics :
a=_jm Y_jm a_jm ,
  jm Y_jm _jm  ,
where the expansion coefficients  are
 dimensional Hermitian matrices in turn.

The modes with spin  are zero-modes since the inverse
propagators vanish for them. There are  of them since we have
removed the trace part already using the translation invariance.
They are the moduli of  coincident fuzzy spheres.
Our strategy is to  integrate massive modes first to obtain the
Wilsonian effective action.
Apart from the constant term which measures the free
energy of the local vacuum,  it is also the functional of zero-modes.
We argue that it must be a non-polynomial matrix model of 
Hermitian matrices which govern the dynamics of the moduli fields.
In this paper we compute the constant part of the effective
action up to the two loop level since it is an
important step to understand the dynamics of the model.
We are content to briefly discuss one loop effective action for
zero modes.


The quadratic action for  is
12  ^ L_ .
In the 3d model of (), we can adopt
^0=^2,
  ^1=^3,
  ^2=^1 .
For Majorana-Weyl spinors in ten dimension,
we can effectively factorize  matrices as
^ = ^0 ^  ,
where
&& ^0=^21_8 ,
   ^9=-^11_8 ,
   ^8=^31_8 ,&& ^i=-1_2 ^i_8 
  (1i7) ,
and   are real and antisymmetric.
With the choice of ,
the fermionic kinetic term of ()
boils down to that of ()
with the multiplicity of 8.

Let us expand  in terms of 
jm _jm Y_jm  .
Since  carries spin ,
the total angular momentum of  is
either  or .
For each state,
the eigenvalue of  is
either  with the multiplicity of  or
 with the multiplicity of  respectively.
It is because
^ L_ =
(L_ +_ 2 )^2-L^2-34  .
In our calculation of the partition function, we divide out the
following gauge volume of  by gauge fixing
2^N^2+N2 -1 ^N-12 
1N  1_k=1 ^N-1  k!   ,
which appeared as the universal factor in.
We recall that the 'exact' free energy of IIB matrix model
is as follows in this normalization-log(_nN 1n^2 ) .
We have 8 real bosonic degrees of freedom
after subtracting the ghost contribution.
We have also 8  doublet real fermionic degrees of freedom as we have
just seen. On the other hand, the degrees of freedom is one each in
().
Since each field is an  dimensional Hermitian matrix,
the one loop determinant takes the following form.
&&((12)^3(23)^5(j-1j)^2j-1 
(jj+1)^2j+1 )^-4n^2 &&(12^2 2^63^4 (j-1)^2j j^2j-2  j^2j+2 (j+1)^2j 
)^4n^2  .
Let us focus on the multiplicity of the eigenvalue of 
in the above expression.
In the fermionic sector, the multiplicity is
. The multiplicity in the bosonic sector
is also . Therefore the bosonic and fermionic contributions
cancel in general.
However we need to recall that we have the upper cut-off for  as
it cannot exceed .
Concerning the largest possible factor  in the one loop
determinant,
the bosonic and fermionic multiplicity is   and 
respectively.
Since they do not match,
we find the following constant term in the effective action
4n^2log(2l+1) .
At one loop level, we can obtain
the effective action with a generic background 
in a closed form as
&&12 Trlog(P^2_ 
-2iF_ -2i_ P^ )-Trlog(P^2)&&-14 Trlog( (P^2+i2 F_ ^ )
(1+_11 2 )),
where
&&[p_ ,X]=P_ X,&&[f_ ,X]=F_ X,  f_ =i[p_ , p_ ].
With our choice of , we find
.
In order to evaluate the contributions from large
eigenvalues,
we may expand this expression into
the power series of .
The leading correction is found to be
2Tr1L^2 
=2n^2_j=1 ^2l (2j+1)1j(j+1) 
4n^2log(2l) .
We find that it is consistent with
the constant term ().

The one loop quantum correction in the model of 
is precisely  of this result.
We thus find non-vanishing one loop quantum corrections
even in a supersymmetric matrix model.
Since SUSY transformation of  () vanishes in these
backgrounds, one might expect that fuzzy spheres do not
receive quantum corrections. We observe that this expectation
failed because the bosonic and fermionic
degrees of freedom do not match at the upper cut-off.
This miss-match can be further traced to the fact that bosonic
fields  are in the integer and
the fermionic fields  are in
the half integer representation of .

This fact might sound contradictory to the presence of
SUSY transformation () in this model.
However we can argue that it must be broken since
there cannot be unbroken supersymmetry
in de-Sitter space.
Since there is no positive conserved energy in de-Sitter space,
there is no supercharge  whose square equals the Hamiltonian.
Since the Euclidean continuation of an -dimensional de-Sitter space
 is an  sphere , our conclusion follows.
In other words, it is a thermal SUSY breaking effect
due to a de-Sitter temperature .
We further note that KMS conditions are satisfied since 'spin-statistics'
relations are respected as we just mentioned.

Let us reflect on the one loop free energy from
quantum gravity point of view.
The matter contribution to the geometric entropy
in 2d supergravity can be obtained through conformal anomaly
on :
-S 
=c4  ,
where  denotes the matter central charge.
Semiclassically
we can integrate this equation as
-S=-c4 log(A) ,
where  is the ratio of short and long distance cut-offs.

On the other hand we may rewrite () as
-4n^2log(2l) +8n^2log(2l)
The second term in this expression can be subtracted by
renormalizing the cosmological constant term.
It is because  we can attribute it to the fermion mass term.
(We recall that the minimally coupled
fermionic kinetic term on  is .) 
The first term is the remaining conformal anomaly (geometric
entropy).
With the identification  and ,
we confirm that the one loop correction in NC gauge theory
on  can be understood from 2d quantum gravity point of view.




In the case of matrix quantum mechanics,
the situation is different since we have the time like
dimension in addition. Although we have analogous difficulties to
construct a model with time independent SUSY,
NC gauge theories on fuzzy spheres with
time dependent SUSY are constructed
in the context of M-theory on a pp-wave in.
The fully supersymmetric solutions of the model are
fuzzy spheres represented by  dimensional
(reducible) representations of .
Since the Hamiltonian can be related to the
squares of the supercharges, the vacuum energy
vanishes for all such configurations.




Although we are mostly content to compute the constant
term of the effective action in this paper,
it also depends on the zero modes.
At the one loop level, we can estimate
the effective action for bosonic
zero-modes  by putting 
in ().
The leading term is
&&-2Tr[1P^2 P_ 1P^2 P_ ]
-2iTr[1P^2 [P_ ,P_ ]1P^2 
^ P_ ]&&= 4n^2log(2l+1) + 4 tra ^ a ^ 
-8tr _i _i
+.
We find that the coincident  spheres are unstable since 
become tachyonic at this order.
When two fuzzy spheres are separated by a large
distance , there is a logarithmic repulsion between the two
8log(2l ) .
Such an instability is absent in 3d model of ()
since there are no  fields.



We delegate the detailed evaluation of
the two loop effective actions to the next section.
In this section we summarize our results and discuss their physical
implications.

In the case of  gauge group, the two loop effective action is
F(l)&=&-361f^4 (F_3^p(l)-F_3^np (l)) .
In the case of 3d model,
F_3d (l)&=&-1f^4 (F_3^p(l)-F_3^np (l)) ,
where  and  are defined in ().
We have  found numerically that
&&F_3^p(l)F_3^np (l)1.91N  ,&&F_3^p(l) - F_3^np (l)6.2 1N^2  .
Therefore we find
F_3d (l)=-6.2f^4N^2 
=-1.5  g_NC ^22  .
Since it is O(1) for fixed , it is much smaller than the tree
 or one loop  contributions.
It is because the amplitude is convergent in our model due to SUSY and
the theory becomes free (ordinary  gauge theory with adjoint matter)
in the infrared limit.

The situation is different for  gauge group.
For  gauge group, we obtain
F(l)=361f^4 (n^3 (F_1^p(l)+2F_2^p(l)-F_3^p(l)
+14 F_5(l))
-n (F_1^np (l)+2F_2^np (l)-F_3^np (l)+14 F_5(l))) ,
where  are defined in () and ().
We have numerically found that
F(l)1f^4 (2l+1) n(n^2-1)  +O(1/ N^2 ).
The total effective action up to the two loop
to the leading order of  is
-f^46 nl(l+1)(2l+1)
+4n^2log(2l+1)
-23.4 1f^4 (2l+1) n(n^2-1) .
If we put , the effective action
becomes
n^2V( -26^2 +4log(V)/V
-23.48  ^2 (1-1/n^2)) .
In this form, we can see that the effective action is proportional
to the volume  and .
It also possesses the standard  expansion where
 is the 't Hooft coupling.

However in a finite matrix model, we may fix  and  not
 and . In this case a gauge group  is
dynamically determined by minimizing the effective action. So we need to
minimize the following expression with respect to 
-f^424n^2 N^3
+4n^2log(N/n)
-23.4 1f^4 N n^2(n^2-1) .
For  gauge group, the tree and the two loop contributions are
comparable when .
Although the tree action is minimized when , we observe that the two
loop contribution could easily overwhelm it if we increase .
Therefore we conclude that the classically favorable
NC  gauge theory on fuzzy sphere is unstable at the two loop level
in a deformed IIB matrix model with a Myers term.
Since this model contains  transverse degrees of freedom,
this instability may correspond to the  barrier in 2d quantum gravity.

In the case of the 3d model,
F_3d (l)=1f^4 (n^3 (F_1^p(l)+2F_2^p(l)-F_3^p(l)
+2F_5(l))
-n (F_1^np (l)+2F_2^np (l)-F_3^np (l)+2F_5(l))) .
We find numerically
F_3d (l)1.1f^4 (2l+1) n(n^2-1)  +O(1/ N^2 ) .
The total effective action up to the two loop
to the leading order of  is
-f^46 nl(l+1)(2l+1)
+12 n^2log(2l+1)
+1.1f^4 (2l+1) n(n^2-1) .
We find again that the two loop correction is  for finite
 which is the same order with the tree action.
As it is recalled in the next section, the situation is very different
from gauge theory in flat space where SUSY cancellations take place
irrespectively of the gauge group. Since SUSY transformation
of  field vanishes classically for any gauge group ,
the existence of quantum corrections signals SUSY breaking effects on
. However the two loop contributions for  gauge groups are
positive in sign and there is no instability of  gauge theory in this
model. The stability of the model is consistent with 2d quantum gravity
since it naively corresponds to  supergravity.


Two loop effective action 

In this section, we evaluate
the two loop effective action
of NC gauge theory on fuzzy sphere.
We consider NC gauge theory with  gauge group in the context of
a deformed IIB matrix model with a Myers term.
We also explain how to modify our results in the case of the 3d model
or different gauge groups.

There are 5 diagrams to evaluate which are
illustrated in  Figure 1.
(a),(b) and (c) represent contributions from gauge fields.
(a) and (b) are of different topology while (c)
involves the Myers type interaction.
(d) involves ghost and (e) fermions respectively.

We expand matrices in terms of matrix spherical harmonics:
&&A_ =p_ +_jm a^ _jm Y_jm  ,&&jm _jm Y_jm  ,
where   and other .
We adopt the following representation of :
 
where they are normalized as

bosonic propagators  
From the quadratic terms in the gauge fixed action, we can read propagators
of gauge boson modes  and ghost modes ,  as
follows
 
In terms of fields

contribution from 3-gauge boson vertices (b) 
Firstly we calculate 2-loop 1PI contribution from 3-gauge boson vertices:
 
There are  type contractions following Wick's theorem
in the calculation of .
The result is that:
  


3j-,6j- symbol expression of the results 
We can further evaluate the matrix representation () in terms
of  and  symbols.
The adjoint  act on  as
 
Using this formula and the expression:
 
one can obtain
 

In the first line, one can use the property of 3j-symbol:
 
and the property of 6j-symbol:
 
Here we need to recall that  singlet states are absent
in the gluon propagator which results in the extra terms on the
right-hand side of (). Although they cancel
each other for  case, it is not the case for 
gauge groups.

In this way one can rewrite () as
9 f^4  
(F_1^p(l)-F_1^np (l)
-F_2^p(l)+F_2^np (l)) ,
where
&&F_1^p(l)=1 2l+1 _j_1j_2=1 ^2l

The overall coefficient  changes to  for the 3d model

Specially we can represent the  matrices as follows
 
where
 
and  are real and antisymmetric.


The fermion  is written by using chiral projection
 
We can rewrite the fermion action as
 
The fermion kinetic term is
S_0^= f^4 2  Tr  [_16 ^T  ^0
 ^  [p_ ,_16 ] ],
where
&& ^0=^21_8,
 ^9=-^11_8,
 ^8=^31_8,&& ^i=-1_2^i_8
(i=1,, 7) .
The interaction vertices are
S_1^= f^4 2  Tr  [_16 ^T  ^0
 ^  [a_ ,_16 ] ]
+f^4 2  Tr  [_16 ^T  ^0
 ^i  [_i ,_16 ] ] .
The kinetic term can be rewritten as
S_0^= f^4 2  Tr  [_a ^T ^2
^  [p_ ,_a ] ],
where  are 8 SU(2) doublets.
From (), the fermion propagator is
 
where  are matrix indices,  are  spin
indices and   are 8 'flavor' indices.
 are defined as follows:
 


fermionic contribution (e) 

2-loop (1PI) contribution to the effective action from the fermion-boson
vertex is
 
We listed the contributions which involve  and 
exchanges separately.

The fermionic contribution in the 3d model is
 1f^4  [ -3F_3^p(l) +3F_3^np (l)
- F_2^p(l) +F_2^np (l) ] .
2-loop effective action 

In this way we find the total 2-loop free energy  of
 NC gauge theory on fuzzy sphere as follows
-F(l)&=&-361f^4 (F_1^p(l)-F_1^np (l)
+2F_2^p(l)-2F_2^np (l)
-F_3^p(l)+F_3^np (l))&=&361f^4 (F_3^p(l)-F_3^np (l)) .
It is because we can prove that 
 by using the Jacobi-identity
in the original matrix representation.
In the case of 3d model,
-F_3d (l)&=&-(F_1^p(l)-F_1^np (l)
+2F_2^p(l)-2F_2^np (l)
-F_3^p(l)+F_3^np (l))&=&F_3^p(l)-F_3^np (l) .
For  gauge group, we obtain
-F(l)=-361f^4 (n^3 (F_1^p(l)+2F_2^p(l)
-F_3^p(l)+14 F_5(l))
-n (F_1^np (l)+2F_2^np (l)-F_3^np (l)+14 F_5(l))) ,
where
F_5(l)=12l+1 _j=1 ^2l 2j+1(j(j+1))^2 
12l+1    (l) .
 takes care of the absence of the  singlet
state in the gluon propagator.
In the 3d model, the two loop effective action for  gauge group is
-F_3d (l)=-1f^4 (n^3 (F_1^p(l)+2F_2^p(l)-F_3^p(l)
+2F_5(l))
-n (F_1^np (l)+2F_2^np (l)-F_3^np (l)+2F_5(l))) .
commutative sphere limit 

In this subsection, we show that
NC gauge theory on fuzzy sphere reduces to ordinary gauge theory
on  in the formal semiclassical (or infrared) limit.
This correspondence implies
Tr Vd4 tr ,
where .
 is the volume of   and  is over  gauge group.
The action ()
gives the following result in the semiclassical limit:
&&Vf^44  d tr
( -14 
(L_  a_ -L_ 
a_ +[a_ ,a_ ])^2
-12 (L_ _i+[a_ ,_i])^2. &&
-14 [_i,_j]^2
+i2 _ 
(L_  a_ -L_  a_ )a_ 
+i3 _ 
[a_ , a_ ]a_   &&.+
12 
 ^ (L_ +[a_ ,])+
12  ^i [_i,]
) .
They are nothing but the ordinary gauge theory action on .
The gauge coupling  is identified with
g_CM ^2= 2lf^4 =lg_NC ^2 .
It is larger than  in () by a factor
. It is because the gauge coupling is scale dependent in
2 dimension. The factor  can be understood if we recall
that the radius of the sphere is  with respect to the
non-commutativity scale and  is the coupling
constant at the infrared cut-off scale.

This correspondence can be proven at the
Feynman rules level.
In the perturbative investigation of ordinary gauge theory on ,
we expand the fields in terms of the spherical harmonics
1V  _jm _jm Y_jm (,) ,
where
d4 Y_j_1m_1 (,)Y_j_2m_2 (,)
=_j_1,j_2 _m_1,-m_2 (-1)^m_1  .
The propagators are
<_j_1m_1  _j_2m_2 >=1f^4 1j_1(j_1+1) _j_1,j_2 
_m_1,-m_2 (-1)^m_1  .
The three point vertices are given in terms of
 symbols since
&&f^4 4V  d Y_j_1m_1 (,)Y_j_2m_2 (,) Y_j_3m_3 (,)&=&f^4 (2j_1+1)(2j_2+1)(2j_3+1) &&( )1 V  
( ) .
The Feynman rules of NC gauge theory on fuzzy sphere have been derived
in this section.
We can see that the propagators are identical
in the both cases as it is well known.
On the other hand,
the interaction vertices of NC gauge theory contain 
symbols. In the large  limit, they can be related to 3j symbols:
 
12l  
( ) ,
with  being fixed.
Hence the interaction vertices of NC gauge theory
() reduces to
those of ordinary gauge theory expression ()
as .
We can thus observe that the former reduces to the latter
in the formal semi-classical limit at the Feynman rules level.


U(1) Yang-Mills theory on non-commutative
 
In this sections, we have calculated the 2-loop effective action of
the matrix models on fuzzy sphere.
In the remainder we compare the results with
the 2-loop 1PI contribution to vacuum energy in
U(1) Yang-Mills theory on fuzzy .

We quote the action:
 
One can obtain this action locally from the matrix models
as it is explained in the preceding section.
In this theory vacuum energy contributions from the 2loop 1PI graphs
can be evaluated as follows:

 
2-loop 1PI from 4-gauge boson vertex:
 
where  denotes the volume of .

2-loop 1PI from 3-gauge boson vertices:
 

2-loop 1PI from ghost-gauge vertices:
 

2-loop 1PI from fermion-gauge vertices:
 

The total amplitude is
 
The first and the second term cancel each other
since
pq p^2q^2(p+q)^2 =
1 2 (1 p^2q^2 -1 q^2(p+q)^2 
-1 p^2(p+q)^2 ) .
From these results and the relation
, we can find the following correspondence
between the amplitudes of
NC  gauge theory on  and :
 

Non-planar phases: 
in NC gauge theories on  correspond to
 in those on .
We point out here that the
 symbols vanish unless the non-planar
phases are trivial in the semiclassical (infrared) limit.
Therefore the non-commutativity plays no role
in the infrared limit in the both theories.
We further observe the identical power counting rules
in the both theories. Namely logarithmically
divergent amplitudes and convergent amplitudes
correspond to each other.

The amplitudes of NC gauge theory on fuzzy , however, are different
from  those on  in the following points:
 
In NC gauge theory on fuzzy ,
the cancellation of 2-loop effective action occurs in the planer and
non-planar sectors separately.  In NC gauge theory on fuzzy , the
corresponding cancellation does not occur if
we consider planar or non-planar contributions separately.

In NC gauge theory on fuzzy , the fermionic contribution gives
rise to extra terms represented by  and .
They result in the non-vanishing
effective action even for  gauge theory.
The origin of this new term may be thought as
the spin connection of fermions in a curved space.




Conclusions and Discussions 
In this paper, we have investigated quantum corrections
in NC gauge theory on fuzzy sphere up to the two loop level.
Such theories are realized by matrix models with a Myers term.
The classical solutions of the matrix models are
reducible representations of  which represent
a group of fuzzy spheres. The irreducible representation which represents
a single fuzzy sphere minimizes the classical action.
These backgrounds are supersymmetric in the sense that
the SUSY transformation of  field classically vanishes.

We have found that the quantum corrections do not vanish at each order.
At the one loop level, it does not vanish due to the presence of
the cut-off for the angular momentum. Due to the mismatch between
the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom at the largest
angular momentum, we find  one loop contribution.
At the two loop level, we find comparable quantum corrections
to the tree action with finite gauge coupling  in the case
of  gauges group. It is because SUSY cancellations do
not take place in planar and non-planar sectors separately
contrary to flat theory. In a deformed IIB matrix model with
a Myers term, we find this effect destabilize the classically
favorable  gauge theory.



Our results are consistent with the fact that
there cannot be unbroken supersymmetry in de-Sitter space
since the Euclidean continuation of an -dimensional de-Sitter space
 is an  sphere .
We may put forward a generic argument as follows.
In any field theory on a homogeneous space ,
we need to identify the Hamiltonian with one of the Killing
vectors which form the Lie algebra of .
Since there is no positive Killing vectors
in this case, there is no positive conserved energy.
It in turn implies that there is no supercharge 
whose square equals the Hamiltonian.
Consequently there cannot be unbroken supersymmetry
in compact homogeneous spaces.

One of the most important questions concerning NC gauge theory
is its relation to quantum gravity.
Various similarities have been pointed out
such as the absence of local gauge invariant operators,
UV-IR mixing and Wilson lines which couple to closed strings.
In this paper we have found that NC gauge theory on 
allows 2d quantum gravitational interpretation.
We have reproduced the semiclassical free energy of
2d supergravity. We have further seen a possible signal for
 barrier. It is therefore tempting to conjecture that
NC gauge theory on  belongs to the same universality class
of 2d quantum gravity.


Since we can locally recover flat theory with SUSY
in these models,
the SUSY breaking effect must come from those
degrees of freedom which is sensitive
to the curvature. They are either infra-red (IR)
or ultra-violet (UV) degrees of freedom.
Since the two loop amplitudes are finite due to SUSY
in our case, we are mostly sensitive to IR degrees of freedom.
In the case of  gauge theory, we find little quantum
corrections since it becomes free theory in IR regime.

In the case of higher dimensional spaces like
 or ,
the effective actions are no longer convergent in the
sense that they are dominated by IR contributions.
In that case,  we expect that
UV degrees of freedom also contribute to the
SUSY breaking effect.
It will be interesting to generalize
our investigations to higher dimensional homogeneous
spaces.
It is also interesting to explore the relevance
of these spaces to IIB matrix model
in the spirit of.
