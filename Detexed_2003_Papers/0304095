It has been shown recently that Cauchy transforms of
orthogonal polynomials appear naturally in general correlation
functions containing ratios of characteristic polynomials of
random  Hermitian matrices.
Our main goal is to investigate
the issue of universality of large N asymptotics for those
Cauchy transforms for a wide class of weight functions.
Our analysis covers three different scaling regimes:
the "hard edge", the "bulk"
and the "soft edge" of the spectrum, thus extending the earlier
results known for the bulk. The principal tool
is to show that for finite matrix size 
the auxiliary "wave functions" associated with the Cauchy transforms
obey the same second order differential equation
as those associated with the orthogonal polynomials themselves.

Introduction 

Characteristic polynomials are important objects in Random Matrix Theory
(RMT) and enjoy a wide range of applications in various fields of
physics and mathematics. To name only a few, we mention the
applications to Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Quantum Chaos
 as well as their role in elucidating properties
 of the Riemann zeta function along the critical line.
In fact, products of ratios of the characteristic polynomials
at different values of the spectral parameter
provide the most general generating functional for all spectral
correlation functions in RMT. Characteristic polynomials
are also useful in providing a direct link between the RMT description
and the effective field theory such as Chiral Perturbation Theory
(PT) in the application to QCD.
There, products of the ratios of characteristic polynomials enjoy a
direct interpretation as partitions functions
including fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom.
However, these objects are very difficult to obtain in
full generality from the finite volume limit of PT, where one has to
parameterize and calculate supergroup integrals.
Alternatively, one has to perform replica calculations exactly
, a possibility opened due to recent progress
in understanding the analytical structure of the moments.
From this side, correlation functions of
characteristic polynomials recently calculated
within  RMT provide the result yet to be obtained
 directly from the field-theoretic calculations.

An important issue for all RMT calculations is the question of
universality. By this one usually understands
that the predictions of RMT for a given object are insensitive to the
details of the particular models.
When this property holds, it must be a consequence of the common
underlying symmetry of that class of the models. This
type of argument validates applying RMT results
to systems of varying nature in all the diverse situations
mentioned above.

The character of universality depends essentially
on the scale in the spectrum one is interested in, as well as
on the nature of the singularity at the support of the spectrum
(the so-called "edges" of the spectrum).
In the following we will be only concerned with the
scales comparable with the mean level spacing.
This issue is widely known as that of "microscopic" universality.
Suppose first one is interested in such quantities as
the correlation function of eigenvalue densities, or the distribution
of the largest/smallest eigenvalue, or some related objects.
Then restricting oneself to the class of
random matrix measures invariant with respect to the change of basis
(here the unitary invariant ensembles)
the quantity of interest can be expressed as a
determinant containing kernels made of polynomials
orthogonal with respect to that measure.
In this way studying universality amounts mainly to
investigating asymptotics of the orthogonal polynomials in various
regimes, and
is well established by now both on physical
as well as mathematical level of rigor.

On the other hand, more general correlation functions containing
products and ratios of the characteristic polynomials
(in particular, those used to generate all
the eigenvalue correlations by differentiation and taking the
discontinuity of the resolvents) attracted considerable
attention only recently.
While for the products only the universality follows quite straightforwardly
from the mentioned results(see also), the universality of expressions
containing inverse powers or ratios was properly understood only in the bulk
of the spectrum.

There are several possibilities to calculate
correlation functions containing ratios of characteristic
polynomials. For the case of the Gaussian measure
the only tool until quite recently was the exploitation of anticommuting
Grassmann variables (the method of "supersymmetry" due to Efetov,
or its variants).
An alternative for general unitary-invariant measures
was discovered quite recently by Fyodorov and Strahov
 and resorts again to the orthogonal polynomial method.
An important new feature, however, is that as soon as inverse powers of
characteristic polynomials are taken into consideration,
 one has to deal not only with the orthogonal polynomials
but also with their so-called Cauchy transforms. More precisely,
a very general result - valid for all invariant ensembles of
finite-size complex Hermitian matrices - reduces arbitrary
correlation function containing
ratios of characteristic polynomials to a determinant made of
orthogonal polynomials and their Cauchy transforms.
The universality of the corresponding expression in the
microscopic limit in the "bulk" of the spectrum was rigorously
demonstrated by Strahov and Fyodorov by using
the Riemann-Hilbert approach.
Those authors however considered neither the "soft" nor the "hard" edge of the
spectrum, the latter being a characteristic feature of the so-called "chiral"
version of the unitary ensemble.

Our goal in the present paper is to employ an alternative
method and to obtain universal asymptotics
for all three regimes, including spectral edges of both types.
This is particularly important
in view of the application to QCD and the role of
characteristic polynomials played there (see. e.g. inand references therein).
The method we are going to exploit to extract universal features
of the correlation functions
is based on the works by Kanzieper and Freilikher.
The clear advantage of this technique is its explicit form and
conceptual simplicity,
although it lacks the rigor and vigor of the Riemann-Hilbert
technique (and in fact makes use of some facts proved by the latter).
First we will show the existence
of an exact second order differential equation satisfied by
the Cauchy transform of the orthogonal polynomials
for a large class of measures. Then by
considering the microscopic large- limit
of that differential equation we can demonstrate their universality
at the origin ("hard edge"), in the bulk and at the soft
edges of the spectrum.
The procedure follows exactly
the same lines as for the orthogonal polynomials themselves (see
), since in both cases we have to
deal with the very same equation.
The universality of asymptotics for the general expressions
 of arbitrary ratios of characteristic polynomials
then follow. It is necessary to mention that the
method implicitly uses an assumption of the existence of a
single-valued function arising in a certain limit
for recursion coefficients relating orthogonal polynomials of
different order. This was indeed shown to be true
in the case of a spectrum supported on a single interval
in the framework of the Riemann-Hilbert
technique.

The article is organized as follows. In sect.
 we give the main definitions and recall the main
result of.
In the following sect.  we derive a differential equation
for the wave functions associated with the Cauchy transforms for
finite 
and show that it is identical to that for the wave functions of
orthogonal polynomials.
For convenience we treat the unitary ensemble (UE) first and
translate to the  chiral unitary ensemble (chUE) later on.
Sect.  deals with the large- limit
yielding universal results for both
unitary and chiral unitary ensemble in all three microscopic regimes.
We close with the discussion and open questions in sect. .





Definitions 

In this section we introduce the main objects we wish to study in the
present paper.
The matrix model partition function with respect to which we calculate
expectation values is given by the following integral over the
(unitary invariant) Haar measure
for matrices :
Z _N   _D [dH]_NN   w(H)
       _D _k=1 ^N d_k  w(_k) _N()^2  .
The matrix  can be either complex Hermitian, representing
a general unitary invariant ensemble without chiral symmetry,
or it can be decomposed into a product of complex rectangular
matrices  of size , ,
representing the chUE. In the first case the matrices 
can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation with
real eigenvalues
 are distributed according to a
weight function  with support on .
In the second case we deal rather with real positive singular values
of the matrices  with the support being
, respectively. We have also employed the
notation 
for the Vandermonde determinant.
While the results cited in this section hold
for general weight functions with convergent moments on some domain
,
we will concentrate mainly on weights of the form 
in the following sections. The potential  may contain
both an (even) polynomial part and a logarithmic part.

We will be interested in extracting the large- universal behavior
of the correlation functions defined via expectation values of
arbitrary ratios of characteristic polynomials:
K _N(M_f,M_b) 
_j=1 ^L (m_j^f 1 _N+H) 
_j=1 ^M (m_j^b 1 _N+H) 
.
In the context of QCD the matrices

 are said to contain the
fermionic  and bosonic  mass terms. The expectation value of
ratios of characteristic polynomials is known as the supersymmetric partition
function. It may be used to calculate correlation functions
of the eigenvalue densities and serves as a general generating function for
multi-point resolvent operators.

In order to give rise to positive definite partition functions in the case
of the UE the masses have to be chosen purely imaginary and occur in pairs of
complex conjugates. In this way only positive definite terms
appear, . In the chUE each
determinant factor is positive provided we parameterize
.
At the same time, from the mathematical point of view
there is no need to impose any restrictions on masses
in eq. (),
apart from requiring infinitesimal imaginary parts for all .

As it has been shown in for general weight functions and
finite size  the generating function eq. ()
can be written as a determinant of
size  containing polynomials orthogonal with respect to the weight
. Let us define the monic orthogonal polynomials

_D d w()
_n()_m()=_nm f_n
with normalization factors  uniquely defined through the Gram-Schmidt
orthogonalization.( For weight functions on 
the corresponding norms can be calculated recursively solving

for even potentials plus an additional equation for potentials without parity.) 
The second building block are the Cauchy transforms of those polynomials
which appear only as long as ,
_n()  1 2i _D 
d w() ,  m()0  .
The result derived in then
reads (The object eq. () can be given a meaning for real
values of the mass parameters  as well, by choosing the principle value
in eq. (). However, to use it as a generating functional we are
precisely interested in its discontinuities in the complex plane.) 
 K (M_f,M_b)1 (M_b)(M _f)

A differential equation for the orthogonal polynomials and their
Cauchy transforms 
As is well known it is convenient to
relate to the system of orthogonal polynomials 
a system of associated objects:
_n()  [-N 2 V_()]
_n() f_n   .
frequently called the "wave functions".
The name has its origin in two properties: (i) the functions
 obey a closed second order
differential equation for finite  which
can be interpreted as a kind of one-dimensional Schroedinger equation
and (ii) the functions are orthonormal. The first property can be
shown, in particular, by the formalism introduced by Kanzieper and Freilikher
, to which we refer an interested reader for a detailed
review. Below we exploit the same formalism to infer properties
of the Cauchy transforms of the orthonormal polynomials, after
suitable redefinition of the wavefunctions.
This will enable us to treat the Cauchy transforms
on equal footing with the polynomials themselves when extracting the
universal properties in the microscopic large- limit.
The wavefunctions of the orthogonal polynomials
and of their Cauchy transforms will be then two independent solutions of the
second order differential equation, with the latter being singular at the
origin.

Due to an intimate relation between the polynomials of the
UE and the chUE for general weights 
we can restrict ourselves to treat only
the UE in greater detail in the following subsection.
Once our results are established those for the chUE
will follow rather straightforwardly, as discussed in
in the subsection .



The Unitary Ensemble 

For the UE the eigenvalues of the complex Hermitian matrix  are
distributed along the full real line. To be specific let us introduce the
following parameterization of the weight function
w()  ^2 [-NV()]   [-NV_ ()] .
Here we have introduced the potential
V_ ()    V() - 2 N ()  ,  
V()=_k=1 ^d/2  g_2k  2k  ^2k  ,
with an even polynomial part  of arbitrary but fixed even degree .
In order to apply the formalism of we switch from monic
polynomials  to orthonormal polynomials,
_kl   = 
_- ^  d  w() p_k()
      p_l()  ,   p_k()= _k()/f_k  .
 The potential in eq. () being even, the polynomials
possess the following parity property:
p_n(-) = (-1)^n  p_n()  .
As is well known (see e.g. and references therein),
all orthogonal polynomials on the real line or a subset of it
satisfy a three-step recursion relation
p_n ()  =  c_n+1 p_n+1 () + c_n p_n-1 ()  ,
where the middle term vanishes because of the parity.
The recursion coefficients can be obtained from the normalization
factors  of the polynomials as:
c_n = f_n f_n-1     .
The second operation, which together with  the multiplication
by  in eq. () closes on the ring of orthogonal
polynomials, is differentiation over .
Following  it can be most conveniently written as
p_n'()    A _n()p_n-1 ()  - 
                       B _n()p_n ()  .
Here, the functions  and  are defined as
A _n()&&N  c_n_- ^  d 
w()      [V_ '() - V_ '()] p_n()^2  

&=&N  c_n_- ^  d 
w()      [V'() - V'()] p_n()^2  ,

B _n()&&N  c_n_- ^  d 
w()   [V_ '() - V_ '()] p_n()p_n-1 () 

         && B _n^reg  ()
             +  (1-(-1)^n)    .
Because of parity the singular
-dependent term drops out in  . Inserting
the explicit form of the potential from eq. ()
it can be easily seen that
 and the regular part 
of  are polynomials of degree  and  respectively.
From their definition one can easily show
the following identity to be valid:
B _n() + B _n-1 ()  +   N  V_ '()
 =   c_n-1  A _n-1 () .
This identity, when combined with the two properties of the
polynomials - the
recursion relation eq. () and the differentiation eq.
() - suffices to show that the following second order differential
equation is satisfied by the wavefunctions defined in Eq.():.
_n"() - F _n()_n'() + G _n()
_n()  =  0  ,
where
 
Here  denotes the derivative with respect to  everywhere.
The differential equation Eq.() holds for finite- and
arbitrary weight  corresponding to a given polynomial
 of degree  and parameter .
The fact that  can be real will enable us to translate most easily
the results for the UE obtained below to the chUE in the next subsection.

Our goal is to derive a similar differential
equation for the Cauchy transform
at finite-. In terms of the orthonormal polynomials they are given by
h_n()   1 2i _- ^+ 
d w() ,  ()0  .
This defines in fact two functions, one in the upper and one in the lower half
plane for positive or negative imaginary part, respectively. Each of it
can be extended to the other half plane using the relation
h_n(-)  = (-1)^n+1  h_n() .
which follows easily from the  parity of the polynomials,
eq. ().
We note that the Cauchy transform has the opposite parity than the
corresponding polynomial.
Let us stress that the transformation () does not relate the
two different functions defined in eq. ().


In the following we show that the object
h _n() [+NV_()] h_n()
satisfies the same recursion relation eq. ()
and differentiation relation eq. () as the corresponding
orthogonal polynomial , provided that .
As an immediate consequence the wavefunction for the Cauchy transform
defined as
_n()   [-N 2 V_()]
     h _n()
 = [+N 2 V_()] h_n()
 ,
satisfies the second order differential equation identical
to Eq. () at finite-, provided the condition  .
The corresponding solution of the differential equation
at finite and large- will then have to be chosen according to the
appropriate boundary condition for  and , respectively.


Let us first consider multiplication on  for :
h_n() &=& 1 2i _- ^+ 
dw() p_n()  ,

&=& -1 2i _- ^+  d w() p_n()
 + 1 2i _- ^+ 
dw() c_n+1 p_n+1 () + c_n p_n-1 ()]

&=&  c_n+1 h_n+1 () + c_n h_n-1 ()  ,   n>0 .
At the first step we have added and subtracted  to cancel the denominator
and used the recursion relation eq. (). At the second step we used
that  is orthogonal to  for .
The fact that the recursion Eq. () also holds for
 as well as for  is an
immediate consequence.

The next step is to consider differentiation acting
on  for :
_h _n() &=&  1 2i _- ^+ 
d e ^N(V_()-V_())  [ N(V_+ p_n'()] 

&=& 1 2i _- ^+ 
    d e ^N(V_()-V_()) 
    [ NV'()-V'()            -2  p_n() . 

&&+.A_n() n-1 ()
-B _n^reg  ()
                   +(1-(-1)^n)^-1  

&=& 1 2i _- ^+ 
    d e ^N(V_()-V_()) 
[ -2  p_n()
+A_n() n-1 () .

&&. - B _n^reg  ()
                   +(1-(-1)^n)^-1  +(1-(-1)^n)  p_n()]

&=& A_n() h _n-1 () -[B _n^reg  ()
 +(1-(-1)^n)  ] h _n () ,   n>d-2 .
Here we first have used the relation 
 and performed the integration by parts.
The second step spells out the definition of  and exploits Eq.
() for . We can now use that
 is a polynomial of order  and thus
orthogonal to  for . The same argument helps
to rewrite 
 and to drop the first term, which is again a polynomial
(this times of the order ) and thus orthogonal to .
We can repeat the same steps for 
and the poles . The remaining terms 
require a little bit more careful treatment.
For  even  is odd and thus the
corresponding integral vanishes identically.
For  odd the last term  gives a
contribution that precisely cancels the first one.
We thus finally arrive at
the same relation for differentiation of
 as that given by eq. ().
Consequently, Eqs. (), ()
and () imply
_n"() - F _n()_n'() + G _n()
_n()  =  0  .
Thus, the wave functions associated with the
orthogonal polynomials and their Cauchy transforms satisfy
the same differential equation, provided that condition
 holds.
This constraint is not an obstacle for large but finite-,
for any given potential  with a fixed finite degree .

The virtue of our analysis at finite  is that it obviously translates
all the universality proofs carried out at the origin, in the bulk and at the
edge of the spectrum for the orthogonal polynomials to their
Cauchy transforms. We will concentrate on the the large- limit in the next section
, but first we repeat the above analysis for the chiral
case of chUE.

The chiral Unitary Ensemble 
The eigenvalues for chUE are distributed on the positive real
line  and governed by the following
chiral weight function:
w^ch ()   ^ [-NV^ch ()]
  [-NV^ch _ ()].
 Here the potential  is
of degree , with  even, and is defined as
V^ch _ ()  
_k=1 ^d/2  g_2k  k  ^k 
-  N ()  .  
The orthogonality relation for the corresponding orthogonal polynomials
denoted as  reads
_kl   = 
_0 ^  d  w^ch () p^() _k, ch ()
p^() _l, ch ()  .
Here we explicitly display the dependence on the parameter .
Substituting  one can easily see that
the orthogonal polynomials of the chUE can be obtained from those
of the UE  by simple replacement
of the argument:
p_n, ch ^() (^2)  = p_2n ^(+1/2) () .
Here we have to appropriately identify the corresponding potential as
V^ch (y^2) = 2 V(y) ,
which effectively means that the non-chiral polynomials are taken at
values . In fact, one can look at the relation Eq. ()
as a generalization of the well-known relation between
generalized Laguerre and Hermite polynomials.
Consequently, there is no need to repeat the whole analysis of the previous
subsection but one can simple read off the chiral
orthogonal polynomials and their asymptotics
from the same differential equation () for even  at shifted
value of .

Let us now show that the Cauchy transforms of the chiral orthogonal
polynomials relate to those of the non-chiral ones as well.
We first define the Cauchy transform for the chiral case as
h_n, ch ^() ()   1 2i _0 ^ 
d w^ch () p^() _n, ch () ,
  m()0 .
Substituting  and
inserting the relation () we obtain
h_n, ch ^() () &=& 1 2i _- ^+ 
dy y y^2-  e ^-NV^ch _ (y^2) 
p^() _n, ch (y^2)


&=& 1 2i _- ^+ 
dy 1 y^2-  e ^-NV^ch _+1/2 (y^2) 
p^(+1/2) _2n (y) ,
where we have used the parity of the non-chiral polynomial
. On the other hand we can rewrite the Cauchy
transform of the non-chiral ensemble eq.
() with an even index  as
h_2n ^() ()  =  1 2i _- ^+ 
dy  y^2-^2  e ^-2NV_ (y) 
p^() _2n (y)  .
Comparing eqs. () and () together with eq. ()
we thus arrive at
h_n, ch ^() (^2)  = 1   h_2n ^(+1/2) ()  ,
where the right hand side has to be taken at  as for the
polynomials themselves.
Consequently the same analysis for the "chiral" Cauchy transforms
follows from the same differential equation ().

We note that while the Cauchy transform eq. () defines a single
function with a cut along the positive real line ,
the second transform in eq.  () defines again two functions in the
upper and lower half plane as in eq. (). It is in this latter
picture on   that the results of the UE can be translated to the
chUE. This is why in the following section we will always give two
different solutions for the chiral Cauchy transforms as well.






Universality 
In this section we demonstrate the universality of
the asymptotic polynomials and
their Cauchy transform in the microscopic limit, which then
translates to all correlation functions
of characteristic polynomials through eq. ().
The limit is called microscopic since it includes a certain rescaling of the
eigenvalues with an appropriate power of the parameter ,
according to the spectral region we investigate.
We will first study the microscopic limit at the origin (frequently
called the "hard edge"). This case is singled out due to the presence of
logarithms in the potential.
The correlations in the bulk of the spectrum then follow easily.
Furthermore we also study the edge of
the spectrum defined by the endpoints of the support of the macroscopic or
smoothed spectral density at large  ("soft edge").
Here we will restrict ourselves to the cases
where the spectrum support is a simply connected
interval, the so-called one-cut phase. We will also stay away
from multicritical points, where the macroscopic density develops extra
zeros at the boundary of spectra or inside the support.
This amounts to requiring the limiting functions for  to be
nonvanishing on the support as well (see eq. () below).
While such multicritical
cases can be, in principle, analyzed in the framework of the same approach
 the issue becomes much more subtle
due to subleading terms in the large- expansion.

Our first step is to derive the large- limit of the differential equations
() and (). Our assumption of the one-cut support
is equivalent to the fact
that in the large- limit the recursion
coefficients  in eq. () approach a single valued function
_n c_n=c(t=n/N) .
While in the earlier physical matrix model literature
this assumption was introduced as an ansatz supported by numerical evidence,
it has been proved rigorously in the recent mathematical literature
.
Eq. () implies the following asymptotic form
for the functions  and  in the differential
equation:
_N 1 N  A_N() && A()  =
a 2 _-a ^a dt tV'(t)-V'() t^2-^2 
1 a^2-t^2  
 

&=& ()
a a^2 - ^2    ,    (-a,a) .
Here  is the endpoint of the spectral support.
For convenience we have also presented
the relation to the macroscopic density of eigenvalues denoted by .
Using the recursion relation eq. () it can be easily seen that
 remains a polynomial of degree , but the coefficients
get smoothened by taking the large- limit.
This corresponds to
the one cut phase through eq. (), with the nonpolynomial part of
 being a simple square root.
The regular part 
of the function  also remains in the same limit a polynomial of
order , with the limiting form:
_N 1 N  B_N() &&
Breg  ()  + (1-(-1)^N)
 N  

&=& 1 2 _-a ^a dt V'(t)-t V'() t^2-^2 
1 a^2-t^2   + (1-(-1)^N)
 N 
Using these expressions we obtain the following result for the
combination entering the differential equation eq. ()
 
We have kept the last term as it will give rise to two different equations for
even and odd .
Consequently,  can be expressed asymptotically only in
terms of   and  therefore via
 by virtue of Eq. ().
We have:
 
Although it seems that the first term in 
is always dominating the
second term may contribute in some regimes as well,
depending on the chosen rescaling of
the eigenvalues which we are about to investigate in the next subsection.


The hard edge 


We start by defining the microscopic rescaling in the large- limit
close to the hard-edge
origin of the spectrum to be
N   .
This amounts to magnifying the correlations at the point
 as  is kept fixed while .
Inserting this rescaling into the differential equations
() and ()
and using the asymptotic expressions for the coefficients,
eqs. () and () it is easy to see that the two terms
with the logarithmic derivative of  are both of subleading order
. We thus obtain
_N"() + ( ^2(0)^2+(-1)^N^2 )
_N() = 0  ,  _N_N, _N .
This expression is clearly universal as the dependence on all the
specific parameters  in the
polynomial potential in eq. () has been translated
into a single parameter - the macroscopic spectral density at
the origin . Due to the oscillating sign
we have to distinguish between even and odd values of
, corresponding to even and odd polynomials and their Cauchy transforms.
The second order differential equation has two independent solutions
and it is the requirement of regularity of the solution at the origin
that dictates which one to be chosen.
The wave functions associated with the polynomials
 are regular at the
origin, fixing the corresponding solution to be Bessel functions of the first kind
. On the other hand the wave functions associated with the
Cauchy transforms are singular at the origin. As we will
see below this makes us to choose solutions to be
Bessel functions of the third kind also known as the Hankel functions,
 or , depending on the sign of
the imaginary part of the complex argument .
We therefore obtain
_2n () &&
((0))^12 J_ ,

_2n+1 () &&
((0))^12 J_+12 ((0))  ,


&& 

_2n () &&
 
.  ,

_2n+1 () &&
 .  .
In order to extract from these wave-function asymptotics the
expressions for the bare polynomials and their Cauchy transforms
we still have to remove the corresponding weight factor from eqs.
() and () accordingly.
The microscopic limit of the weight function eq. () reads:
_N N^2 w() = ^2   .
Multiplying or dividing the respective wavefunction
by the square root of the weight function,
we arrive at the final universal expressions to be inserted
into the determinant of eq. ():
p_2n () &&
^-+12 J_,

p_2n+1 () &&
^-+12 J_+12 ((0)) ,


&& 

h_2n () && 
 
.  ,

h_2n+1 () && 
 
.  .
Let us now justify our choice of the type of Bessel functions
featuring in eq. ().
Due to the singularity at the origin we have to choose
between Bessel functions of second kind (also known as Weber
functions), ,
and the Hankel functions. We give two independent arguments in favor of
the latter choice.
The first reason for selecting the Hankel functions is that it allows
one to match the known "bulk" asymptotic result after
taking the asymptotic limit .
While the Weber functions would asymptotically produce sine
and cosine terms (as the Bessel functions of first kind do), the
Cauchy transforms in the bulk were shown to
approach .
This asymptotic is correctly reproduced by the Hankel functions.
The second argument is related with the necessity to distinguish between
the two types of the Hankel functions  and
 according to the sign of .




In fact, for  and Gaussian potential 
one can explicitly write down the integral representations
for the polynomials and Cauchy transforms at finite-, as discussed
in.
Switching back to the monic normalization the polynomials
are the Hermite polynomials .
It follows that
_2m ()   &=& e ^N^2 (-1)^m 2N _0^ds
  e ^-Ns^2  s^2m+12  J_-12 (2Ns) 

_2m+1 () &=&  e ^N^2 (-1)^m 2N _0^ds
e ^-Ns^2  s^2m+32  J_+12 (2Ns)  ,
where we have used the standard integral representation of the Hermite
polynomials as well as reexpressed cosine and sine by the half-integer
Bessel functions
. As a consistency check one can verify
that eq. () at 
follows from a saddle point approximation in the microscopic large- limit,
remembering that  for the Gaussian potential.
Using eq. () we obtain a finite- integral representation of
the Cauchy transforms as follows. We can rewrite
1 x-  = sgn [()]i _0^dt
[-sgn [()]it(x-)]
 ,  ()0 .
Inserting eqs. () and () into the definition
() we can first perform the integral over  and then
the one over , arriving at
_2m () &=& (-1)^m N 
_0^ds e ^-Ns^2 s^2m+1 2  

  ,
. 

_2m+1 () &=& (-1)^m N 
_0^ds e ^-Ns^2 s^2m+3 2  

 
.  .
In taking the microscopic large- limit we again recover
eq. () at  from a saddle point approximation.
This fact confirms the correct choice of the solution for the
Cauchy transform and thus for the wavefunctions eq. ()
for a Gaussian potential with . Since the parameters
 as well as the higher order coupling constants
 in the potential eq. () are real and can be switched
on smoothly the choice of the type of Hankel function remains fixed
for a general potential for general  as well.


Now we can use the relations between the polynomials and
Cauchy transforms of the
chiral and non-chiral ensemble, eqs. () and ()
respectively, to read off immediately the universal asymptotic formulas
for the chiral Unitary Ensemble  from () and ():
p_n, ch ^() (^2) &&
^- J_ ((0)) ,


&& 

h_n, ch ^() (^2) && 
 
.  .
We see that for integer values of 
the indices of the Bessel functions
are also integer, compared to half
integer values for the non-chiral case above.
To fix independently the correct
Bessel solution corresponding to the sign of
 we can repeat the argument as in eqs. () and
(), but this time for general .
The corresponding finite- expression have already been given in
, following the integral representation
of generalized Laguerre polynomials, and we only repeat them here:
_n,ch (x^2)&=& e ^Nx^2  (-1)^n Nx^- 
_0^ dt e ^-Nt t^n+/2 J_ 
(2Nxt ) ,


_n, ch (^2)    &=&(-1)^n 2 
N^ 
_0^ dt e ^-Nt t^n+/2 
 
 
.  .
The  saddle point approximation reconfirms eq. () for the
Gaussian potential 
and, by invoking the continuity argument for a general potential as well.


The bulk of the spectrum 

In this section we briefly describe the microscopic limit
in the bulk of the spectrum, which
amounts to setting  in the differential equation
(). For the non-chiral case the corresponding formulae
match with those obtained in.

It is evident that when logarithmic terms are absent the
origin of the spectrum is no longer singled out. Under these conditions
correlation functions when properly scaled
should be the same at every point inside the support of the spectrum,
due to translational invariance.
More precisely, let us pick a fixed value , that means
neither at the origin nor at the edge of the support.
The microscopic rescaling around the chosen point is
then defined as
N(  .
Inserting this expression into that for the asymptotic coefficients,
eqs. () and
(), we can easily see that only the first term in
 contributes yielding
_N"() +  ^2(_*)^2
_N() = 0  ,  _N_N, _N .
where we used eq. () squared.
This is just eq. () with
, replacing  by the universal parameter . From
eqs. () and
() we see that the solutions are Bessel functions of index
, which are just sine and cosine.
The differential equation no longer
distinguishes between even and odd , but the parity fixes the solution
uniquely. The solutions for the asymptotic Cauchy
transform will no longer be singular as we expand around the point
. However, we can still use the results of the previous subsection
for  in order to fix the solution uniquely
depending on the sign  in the Cauchy transform.
Omitting the constant proportionality factor
 when switching from
wavefunctions to polynomials and their Cauchy transforms
yields the explicit expressions for the latter:
p_2n () && ((_*)) ,

p_2n+1 () &&
((_*)) ,


&& 

h_2n () && 
 
.  ,

h_2n+1 () && 
 
.  .
Due to the fact that no -dependence is present in eq. ()
the polynomials and Cauchy transform in the chiral ensemble are identical to
the even half of the non-chiral ones.  The eqs. () and
() then give:
p_n, ch ^() (^2) &&
 ((_*)) ,


&& 

h_n, ch ^() (^2) && 
 
.  .
The soft edge 

Finally we turn our attention to the correlation functions
in the vicinity of the edges  of
the support of the spectrum, the so-called soft edges.
Restricting ourselves to  for symmetry reasons we define
the microscopic scaling limit at the soft edge as
N^23 (  .
In this way we magnify the region around the endpoint of the support.
For negative (positive)  we are inside (outside) the support.
In the limit eq. () only the first term in eq. ()
contributes and the different power in  is due to the factor 
that multiplies . In the large- limit the differential
equation acquires the form:
_N"() -  2A(a)^2 a 
_N() = 0  ,  _N_N, _N .
It is again universal, extending the results of to the
Cauchy transforms.
After changing variables the solutions is obtained  in terms of
the Airy functions. Again omitting the prefactors  when
changing
from wavefunctions to the original polynomials and Cauchy transforms
we obtain:
p_N () && Ai ((2a^-1 A(a)^2)^13 )
 ,

&& 

h_N () &&

 
. .
Here we have chosen for the Cauchy transforms one of the two solutions
of the Airy equation, that one which is linearly independent
of , in coordination with
the sign of :
Ai ( ze ^2i 3  )  =
12  e ^i 3  
( Ai (z)  i Bi (z))
The functions Bi is a new feature emerging when
negative moments of the characteristic polynomials
are considered. For positive moments only, as well as for the
spectral densities and related objectsonly functions Ai feature in the final results.

The discontinuity between the two solutions is again a simple Airy function,
due to the functional relation:
Ai (z) = -e ^+2i 3  
Ai ( ze ^+2i 3  )  -
e ^-2i 3  
Ai ( ze ^-2i 3  )
For real negative argument
the Airy functions  and 
are oscillating while for positive
argument they monotonously decrease/increase, respectively.
For large positive argument we conclude that
_z+ e ^2i 3  
Ai ( ze ^2i 3  )
 = -i Bi (z)  ,
and thus see that both solutions eq. () agree.
This fixes our choice of the boundary condition as for large
positive arguments outside the support the Cauchy transforms should no
longer experience a discontinuity across the real line.

The solution for even and odd  is eqs.  () and
() are the same. This immediately
implies that the results for the UE and the
chUE are identical, as must be the case far from the origin of the spectrum.
Therefore we have to compute also the
difference between  and  as
they both appear in expressions relating the correlation functions containing
ratios  of characteristic polynomials to orthogonal polynomials and
their Cauchy transform(The same
remark in fact applies already to the chUE in the
previous subsections.) .
For that aim we use explicitly the differentiation eqs. () and
() for the corresponding wave functions together with the
limiting relation eq. ().
Following we finally obtain:
_N-1 () = _N()
 +  1 N^13 A(a) _N'()
 ,  _N_N, _N .
This completes our demonstration of universality for the
orthogonal polynomials and their Cauchy transforms for both the UE
and chUE, in all three different regions of the spectrum.

We close with the following comment.
Once the  universality of
expectation values of ratios of characteristic polynomials
eq. () is demonstrated it
immediately translates to that of all other
correlation functions
that are generated by them by differentiations.
As a check we can consider the correlation function of the
 eigenvalue densities by using
eqs. () - ()
eqs. () - () respectively,
and taking necessary derivatives and discontinuities.
In this way one reproduces the known universal
microscopic spectral densities of the unitary and
chiral unitary ensemble, respectively, see e.g..
It covers the bulk limit by setting .
The difference is that in the chUE the resolvent
has a true singularity at the origin while in the UE the discontinuity
originates from patching two different solutions, each of which is regular
at this point. This is another way of seeing that for the UE the
"old" replica limit using saddle point techniques is only able
to reproduce the asymptotic expansionswhile for the chiral case it yields the exact result.
Similar checks for the universal microscopic eigenvalue density
at the soft edge can be performed using  eqs. () and
(), recovering known expression from.








Discussion 
For a broad class of measures we have shown
that the Cauchy transforms of orthogonal polynomials
display properties very similar to those of the polynomials themselves.
In particular, they obey the same three step recursion relation.
The wave functions associated with the Cauchy transforms
satisfy the same second order differential equation
as those associated with the polynomials.
This correspondence holds for finite-
with polynomial potentials of arbitrary
but fixed even degree , provided that .
In the microscopic large- limit we have thus obtained the same
universal Bessel equation at the hard edge, and the Airy equation at
the soft edge of the spectrum.
For the Cauchy transform the choice of the correct solutions is dictated
by their singularity at the origin and the sign of the imaginary part
of the argument. This identification was also supported
by a comparison with exact integral representations
available for the Gaussian weight at finite-.

Using the general resultsthe universality of arbitrary ratios of characteristic
polynomials in RMT with unitary invariance thus follows.
Our consideration complements the rigorous
proof valid for the bulk of the spectrum and
relied on the Riemann-Hilbert approach.
The arguments presented here rely on the previous results in
. Although partly heuristic
by strict mathematical standards, the method
has the  clear advantage of being much more transparent
and able to treat both cases of the chUE and the UE on equal footing.

Since our differential equation for the wavefunctions is valid at finite-
we could be tempted to take the macroscopic large- limit as well.
It gives the eigenvalue correlations at distances large compared to the mean
level spacing, where the local fluctuations are smoothed.
While the spectral density itself is non-universal, all higher order
connected correlation functions are known to be universal
. It has been shown in that the density and the
connected two point function can be also obtained from smoothing products
of orthogonal polynomials. However, for higher order correlations
the corrections to the orthogonal polynomials
become extremely difficult to evaluate and are unknown so far.
For that reason  we have not tried to consider smoothened
Cauchy transforms in order to recover the known
one and two-point function.
It is also less clear if the procedures of smoothening and
taking the discontinuity after differentiation can be interchanged
safely.

Finally it would be very interesting to extend the general results
 to matrix models with complex eigenvalues and to prove their
universality. First results in this direction have already been obtained
. There,
arbitrary products of characteristic polynomials have been
expressed in a determinant formula, which allowed to demonstrate
 their universality at the regime of weak non-Hermiticity.
