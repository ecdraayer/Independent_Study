We study the gauged sigma model and its mirror Landau-Ginsburg model corresponding to 
type IIA on the  Fermat degree-24 hypersurface in
 (whose blow-up gives the smooth ) 
away from the orbifold singularities, and its orientifold by a freely-acting
antiholomorphic involution.
We derive  the Picard-Fuchs equation obeyed by the period integral as defined
in, of the parent  type IIA theory of We obtain
the Meijer's basis of solutions to the equation in the large and 
 small complex structure limits (on the mirror Landau-Ginsburg side)
of the abovementioned Calabi-Yau, and make some remarks about the monodromy properties 
associated based on, at the same and another MATHEMATICAlly interesting
point.  Based on a recently shown  four-dimensional trialitybetween Heterotic on the self-mirror Calabi-Yau , 
 theory on  and 
-theory on an elliptically fibered  with the base given by 
Enriques surface, we first give a heuristic argument 
that there can be no superpotential generated in the orientifold of 
of ,
 and then explicitly verify the same using mirror symmetry formulation offor the abovementioned hypersurface away from its orbifold singularities. We 
then discuss briefly the sigma model and the mirror Landau-Ginsburg model
corresponding to the resolved Calabi-Yau as well.
Introduction 

The periods are the building blocks, e.g., for getting the prepotential
in  type II theories compactified on a Calabi-Yau that in turn
determines the gauge and the Yukawa couplings, as well as getting the
superpotential in the context of  type II theories on
(orientifolds of) Calabi-Yau with(out) branes/fluxes. It is in this regard
that the Picard-Fuchs equation satisfied by the periods, become quite 
important.
In the context of toric geometry, the Picard-Fuchs equation has been obtained in the past
essentially based on two approaches 
- one based on , and the other based onfollowed in. 
It is that will be somewhat closer in spirit to the way we derive the solution
to the Picard-Fuchs equation for the degree-24  Fermat hypersurface in 
corresponding to the compact , away from its orbifold singularities. 
However, in the literature, it is largely
the large complex structure limit in the moduli space that has been
considered where one has to either actually evaluate the integral
(The Griffiths definition of the period ()
for, e.g., one-paramater hypersurface  in  is: 


=
 where 
. The integral is then evaluated in the
limit:. We however do not
restrict ourselves to  this limit (besides, we are largely
interested in Fermat hypersurfaces as the ), and hence we
do not wish to directly evaluate the integral.) 
or solve the indicial equation
to get the "fundamental period" and then generate other (logarithmic) 
solutions from it by the  action of derivatives. Part of the motivation for 
this
work is to follow the alternative formulation of for 
deriving the Picard-Fuchs
equation for a definition of period integral more suited to evaluating BPS mass formulae,
and to obtain solutions valid in the large and  small complex structure limit.
The reason for studying  is not arbitrary. It stems from the following.
In, we had obtained at the level of spectrum matching, an
 triality between Heterotic on the self-mirror Voisin-Borcea Calabi-Yau
,  theory on the 'barely -manifold (i.e., with 
holonomy) constructed from a freely acting antiholomorphic involution on ,
 and  theory on an elliptically fibered 4-fold whose base was 
Enriques surface(There was an apparent puzzle raised in on the -theory
side - the Hodge data of the expected 4-fold does not match the Hodge data of the 
freely acting orbifold of  that one would naively have guessed on the 
basis of known dualities between type , Heterotic and (and definition of)  theory. Of
course, the 4-fold with the derived Hodge data and fibration structure, has to exist, because
the -theory dual has to exist.) .
We would like to be able to strengthen this triality by matching interesting calculable quantities
on all sides. In this paper, we take a small step in that direction by first heuristically
arguring a null superpotential on the -theory and Heterotic sides, and then explicitly 
verifying the same in type , though for this work, away from the orbifold singularities
of the Fermat hypersurface in .

Hence, to summarize, we wish to study the compact  as well as a particular
freely acting involution thereof (using which one can get the  type  
background of, and its -theory uplift of), 
from the point of view gauged linear sigma model (and mirror symmetry).

The plan of the  rest of the paper is as follows. In section 2 , we describe the 
basics relevant to gauged linear sigma model and its mirror Landau-Ginsburg model, and set up
the definition of the period integral for compact Calabi-Yau manifolds, using.
In section 3 , we derive the Picard-Fuchs equation as well as study the Meijer
basis of solutions in the large and small complex structure limits (on the 
mirror Landau-Ginsburg side) of the Calabi-Yau. 
We also study the Picard-Fuchs equation at a MATHEMATICAlly interesting point,
which in terms of rescaled coordinates, corresponds to the usually troublesome
 point. In section 4 ,
we give a plausibility argument, to begin with, to expect a null superpotential in the
aforemetioned free orientifold of type , and then explicitly check the 
same using mirror symmetry
arguments of. Section 5  has the conclusion as well as future directions including a brief discussion on the gauged linear sigma model and
the mirror Landau-Ginsburg model corresponding to the resolved .




The Gauged Linear Sigma Model and the mirror Landau Ginsburg Model 

Consider the Calabi-Yau 3-fold given as a degree-24 Fermat 
hypersurface in the weighted projective
space :
 
This is transverse, as  has only
 as the solution, which does not belong to the hypersurface. However, 
has a -singularity curve and a -singularity point. To see this,
in the defintion:
 
set  to see that one gets a -singularity along 
which is a curve in the Calabi-Yau, and if one sets , one 
gets a -singularity along the point . The singularity
resolution can be summarized by the following. The -singularity is blown up
by a  so that the Calabi-Yau is a -fibration over this ,
and the  singularity is resolved by taking the  fiber itself to be
an elliptic firbation over another . This gives the smooth 
(Using Greene-Plesser's prescription, the mirror  is obtained by
 the generators of the orbifolds being given by:
)  .
In this paper, except for the last section,
we assume that one is away from the orbifold singularities mentioned above.
In the section on Conclusion and Future directions (section 5 ), we
briefly discuss the gauged linear sigma model and its mirror Landau-Ginsburg
model for the resolved .

Type IIA theory on the above Calabi-Yau can be described, based on, by
a gauged linear sigma model by six chiral superfields  with  charges
(1,1,2,8,12,-24) satisfying the following constraint:
 
with the linear sigma model superpotential  given by 
 
The mirror Landau-Ginsburg (LG) theory will be given in terms of a vector multiplet with
field strength  and twisted chiral superfields , satisfying the
constraint:
 
with
 
The mirror LG superpotential  is given by
 
where  are the weights. The constraint () can be solved
by:
 
Solving for , one gets:
 
Hence,
 
The period integral as defined in for compact manfiolds is:
 
For the Calabi-Yau under consideration, one thus gets:
 

Picard-Fuchs Equation 

In this section we derive the Picard-Fuchs equation from the gauged linear sigma model on
the Calabi-Yau given by (). 
To obtain the Picard-Fuchs equation, following, consider:
 
such that:
 
Writing:
 
and then defining a corresponding ,
one then obtains the following Picard-Fuchs equation
 
One notes that (See):
 
where
 
Hence, one 
sees that:
 
If 
 
then
 
using which one gets:
 
Using (), one gets the following Picard-Fuchs equation:
 

Solution to the Picard-Fuchs Equation 

In this subsection, we discuss the solution to the Picard-Fuchs equation ().
We will do so around
 (a)  which could be interpreted as 
the large and small complex structure limits (on the mirror Landau-Ginsburg
side), respectively, 
and (b)  - a "MATHEMATICA"lly interesting
point.

Solution around  

One notes that 
 can be made small by, e.g., taking
 corresponding to the large complex structure limit
on the mirror Landau-Ginsburg side.
On the other hand by, e.g., taking , corresponding to
the small complex structure limit (on the mirror Landau-Ginsburg side), 
one can make . It is usually
the large complex structure limit that has been largely dealt with in the
literature. Additionally, for finite values of the complex structure
deformation parameters 's,
 can alternatively correspond to large size of the Calabi-Yau,
parameterized by (large) .
In this work, we solve for both  the limits with equal ease,
following. The method has the additional advantage that
the solutions with logarithmic terms corresponding to the large complex
structure limit, do not have to be obtained by any process of differentiation
of solutions with some additional parameter that is eventually set to zero.
One gets them as naturally as the one without the logarithmic terms.

By setting  and , one sees that the
Picard-Fuchs equation () can be written as:
 
The numerical factor on the RHS can be absorbed into  after a suitable rescaling and
noting that  remains invariant under such a rescaling.  
Comparing ( with the following differential equation for a generalized
Hypergeometric function (See)(We thank C.I.Lazirou for bringing
 to our attention.)  





:
 
one notes:
 
One 
solution to () can be written in terms of the following generalized
hypergeometric function
 
From the above solution, using properties involving the generalized hypergeometric
function  and the Meijer function :
 
one generates the following additional 23 solutions that together with ()
forms the Meijer basis of solutions to the Picard-Fuchs equation ():
 
Now, to get an infinite series expansion in  for  as well as , 
one uses the following
Mellin-Barnes integral represention for the Meijer's function :
 
where the contour  lies to the right 
of the poles at  and
to the left of the poles at  (See Fig 1).

file=cont1rot.ps,width=0.8   
The contour  for : The poles  are denoted by  and the
poles  are denoted by  
  Given that one is interested in the region , one can deform the contour 
to   in Fig 2 below:

The deformed contour  valid for , and  
valid for  
In the following we evaluate the Mellin-Barnes integral for the Meijer basis of solutions based
on the techniques of.

(a) 
 
Using 
 
implying a pole of order 2 at 
and a pole of order 1 at , and the fact that the pole at  will not contribute
to the residue because the residue will involve multiplication of a finite quantity
(The finite quantity being: 

.)  with

 implying that there will be a  factor nullifying the contribution
to the residue
Hence, the final answer is:
 

Similarly, for , by deforming the contour  to the one ,
and on using that 
, one gets the following result:
 
We explicitly evaluate below the solutions , the others following
suit.

()
 
For arguments similar to the one in (a) above, again the pole of order 3 at  does not contribute
to the residue (For the sake of completeness, the finite term that gets multiplied by
 this time is:

 

.) .The final answer is:
 

Similar to  above, 
for , one gets the following result:
 

()
 
Using , and arguments above, one can show that the
pole of order 4 at  does not contribute to the residue, and the pole of order 3 at 
and a simple at ,
contribute
 the following to the residue:
 

For , one gets the following result:
 


()
 
The integral () has a pole of order 3 at  and simple poles
at , and the final
answer is:
 

For , one gets the following result:
 
The appearance of log in the above solutions is indicative of the degeneracy
in the indicial equation corresponding to the Picard-Fuchs equation. Note
the absence of  terms in the solutions above.

The Picard-Fuchs equation can be written in the form:
 
where the 23 's after rescaling  such that the coefficient of
 is , is given in Appendix A.
The Picard-Fuchs
equation in the form written in () can alternatively be expressed as
the following system of 24 linear differential equations:
 
The matrix on the RHS of () is usually denoted by . 

If the 24 solutions, ,
 are collected as a column vector , then the
monodromy matrix  for  is defined by:
 
The basis for the space of solutions can be collected as the
columns of the "fundamental matrix"  given by:
 
where  and  are 2424 matrices that single and
multiple-valued respectively. Note that , which influences
the monodromy properties. Also,
  
implying that
 
Now, writing , and further
noting that there are no terms of order higher than  in 
 
obtained above, implies that the matrix  must satisfy the property:
. Hence, 
 It is not possible to evaluate all the eigenvalues
of the matrix  (using the expressions for  in Appendix A) using
Mathematica because of the degree-24 characteristic
equation that one would require to solve. Mathematica does predict a 4-fold
degenerare null eigenvalue though. Irrespective of whether or not the
distinct eigenvalues of  differ by integers, one has to evaluate
. Using Mathematica, one gets a very complicated expression,
whose form in terms of powers of  and the null entries are given by:
 
Under the change of basis (See): 
, and by choosing  such that
, one gets . In principle,
one could try to evaluate  using techniques given in.

The MATHEMATICAlly interesting point  

We now discuss Picard-Fuchs equation about a certain point, where curiously,
using Mathematica, one is able to solve for the eigenvalues of the 
2424 matrix "", and one finds that they differ by integers
implying that the monodromy matrix can not be given by .
There is not much known about solutions to the Picard-Fuchs equation 
about , and after rescaling, the abovementioned
point, in terms of the rescaled , corresponds precisely to solving the
Picard-Fuchs equation about (rescaled). To be able say something definite
about the monodromy, will help in understanding the solution as well. It
is in this regard that this (sub)subsection is quite relevant.
 
If one does not make the substitution , then
the Picard-Fuchs equation can be written in the following form:
 
where 's are regular. 
After the shift: , and using:
 
one can rewrite the Picard-Fuchs equation () as:
 
where
 
One hence notices that  is a regular singular point of the differential equation
().
The expressions for the 24  (from where one can read off 's) is
given partly for the sake of completeness and partly to verify the structure of terms
as given on the RHS of () and to read off the expressions for 
necessary for determining the matrix , is given in the appendix. 
The matrix  is given by:
 
The reason why (before the shift)= is MATHEMATICAlly interesting is
that Mathematica is able to determine the eigenvalues of  ! They are given by
 - they differ by integers. As a consequence, one can not
set  to  (See). 

The matrix  is given by:
 
where

Again, as in 3.1.2 , for a suitable , the monodromy matrix
is given by .
Superpotential Calculation 

In, at the level of spectrum matching, it was shown that Heterotic on the self-mirror 
Calabi-Yau  is dual to  theory on the 'barely' -Manifold 
where the  involved the Enriques involution times a reflection of the . It was also shown
that the expected -theory dual for the above must involve an elliptically fibered  that 
has the Hodge data:  and which has a trivially rationally ruled
base given by Enriques surface(As mentioned in
the footnote on page 2, there was a puzzle raised in the context of
the -theory dual, namely, the required 4-fold could neither be obtained as a free involution (to guarantee
a null Euler characteristic, because there are no -theory 3-branes as there are no nonperturbative
Heterotic 5-branes in Heterotic on ) of , nor is it possible to 
construct it as a hypersurface in a toric variety explaining its absence in the (incomplete) list of
's obtained as hypersurfaces in  in.) .

In this section, we first give a heuristic argument to show that there can no be no superpotential generated on
the type IIA side that got uplifted the abovementioned 'barely'
-manifold, by indicating that there
can be no superpotential on the  theory and Heterotic sides. Then, using mirror symmetry, away from
the orbifold singularities of , we show explicitly that indeed, there is no superpotential
on the freely acting orbifold of  as used in.

As per the work of Witten in, if one considers -theory on an
elliptically fibered   with the holomorphic map  having a 6-divisor 
as a section such that , then in the limit of vanishing size of the the elliptic
fiber, 5-branes wrapped around  in -theory on the same  obeying the unit-arithmetic genus
condition:
 
correspond to 3-branes wrapped around  in type , or equivalently -theory 3-branes wrapped around
. In other words, only 3-branes contribute to the superpotential in -theory. Since,
there are no 3-branes in the -theory dual that we have, this implies that there can be no superpotential
generated on the -theory side.

Now, given that F-theory 3-branes correspond to Heterotic instantons, one again expects no superpotential to
be generated on the Heterotic theory side on the self-mirror  based on the  type IIA/Heterotic
dual of 
where the same self-mirror Calabi-Yau figured on the type IIA side and the self-mirror nature was argued to show
that there are no world-sheet or space-time instanton corrections to the classical moduli space.(We thank W.Lerche for pointing this out to us.)  Now, if the 
abovementioned triality is correct, then one should be able to show that there is no superpotential generated
on type  side on the freely-acting antiholomorphic involution of . We will, in this paper,
look at the Fermat's hypersurface of section 2  away from the orbifold singularities discussed in the same
section. The freely acting antiholomorphic involution  is defined as:
 
As discussed in,  has the interesting property that as an action on the cohomology of
, it reflects  and complex conjugates  in general, and in the large 
base () limit of , as in,  reflects the Ka hler form
and complex conjugates every element of  precisely , i.e., not just up to total differentials.

In the following,
the arguments similar to those of will used.
Now, on the mirror type  side, the superpotential  is generated from domain-wall tention, the domain wall
being -branes wrapped around supersymmetric 3-cycles embedded in Calabi-Yau 3-folds. The expression for the
superpotential is given by:
 
where  is the holomorphic 3-form for the Calabi-Yau 3-fold, and
's are 2-cycles corresponding to the positions of -branes or -planes, i.e., objects carrying
 brane charge. From the world-sheet point of view, the  branes correspond to disc amplitudes and
-planes correspond to  amplitudes(If  are used for the homogenous coordinates of
the  in the  regarded as -fibration over , then one gets an 
from .)  As there are no branes in our theory, we need to consider only 
amplitudes. Now, type  on a freely acting involution of a Calabi-Yau with no branes or fluxes can still
generate a superpotential because it is possible that free involution on type  side corresponds to
orientifold planes in the mirror type  side, which can generate a superpotential. 
An example of this is that a freely acting orientifold of  on   involving a shift along the  alongwith
world sheet orientation reversal
is T-dual to an  pair  at antipodal points on the dual circle, 
as given  in(We thank M.Aganagic for pointing this out to us.) .

Now, the  Landau-Ginsburg superpotential  enters as:
 
Now, the measure is reflected under the world-sheet orientation reversal . Hence, for () to be
invariant under , 
 
From the discussion in section 2 , one knows that 
 
where 's are the twisted chiral superfields (of the mirror to the  gauged linear sigma model). Now,
promoting the action of  given in () to the one on the chiral superfields :
 
and using , one gets the following action of  on the twisted chiral superfields 's:
 
The action of  on  implies that  acts without fixed points even on the twisted
chiral superfields, further implying that there are no orientifold fixed planes, and hence no
superpotential is generated on the type  side away from the orbifold
singularities .

Conclusion and Future Directions 

In this paper, we considered type  and a free-orientifold of it on 
the compact  expressed as a degree-24 hypersurface
in , away from its orbifold singularities, from a 
gauged linear sigma model
point of view. We first derived the Picard-Fuchs equation, and obtained its Meijer basis
of solutions in the large and  small complex structure limits (on the 
mirror Landau-Ginsburg side) of the Calabi-Yau. We made some
comments about the monodromy properties of the solutions, including at the special point,
 rescaled "original" ). Then, we argue both indirectly and then directly,
that there can be no superpotential generated in type  on the aforementined free involution
of the Fermat hypersurface (that gets smoothed out to ). 
So far, the argument has been given in the moduli space of the Calabi-Yau
away from the  orbifold singularities of the hypersurface in . 
One has to see, how to improve the argument to consider the resolved manifold with
a  fibration over a , and the  itself being an elliptic fibration over another
. In this direction, one notes that after resolving the  and
 singularities discussed in section , one ends up introducing two
new chiral superfields corresponding to the two 's
that are required to
be introduced in blowing up the singularities. One then has to consider three instead
of a single  action, and the 
(The  considered in this paper will be
 an elliptic fibration over the Hirzebruch surface .) 
can be expressed as a suitable 
holomorphic quotient corresponding to a smooth toric variety. To be more specific, one
considers the resolved Calabi-Yau  as the holomorphic quotient:

, where the diagonal  actions
on the seven coordinates of  are given by:
 
where the three sets of charges  (the "0" being for
the extra chiral superfield with ) are give by the following
(We are deeply grateful to A.Klemm for discussions on material presented here 
on the resolution.) :
 
where on noting:
 
one identifies  as the two extra chiral superfields introduced as a consequence of
singularity resolution. 

To write the superpotential, one can start with the ansatz:
 
where in order to guarantee invariance under each of the three  actions, one gets
the following three constraints on the eight chiral superfields:
 
in which by keeping, say,  arbitrary, one gets:
 
where one has to ensure that the resulting  is transverse. One could perhaps, set 
, so as to rewrite , as in.
The form of  will help determine the antiholomorphic involution of the smooth 
for the  type IIA theory.

On the mirror Landau-Ginsburg side, for the  type IIB theory,
one notes that it will be given by a  gauge
theory with field strengths  with a superpotential  given by:
 
which after integrating out the 's, gives the three constraints:
 
One thus gets:
 

One can also look at the special Lagrangian submanifolds on the type IIA
side and their mirrors on the type IIB side. We will do so in the context
of  theories.
The special Lagrangian submanifolds (See)
are characterized by charges ""
which satisfy:
 
and which restrict the chiral superfields 's to:
 
for some constant 's. Using , one sees
the following equation for the mirror of the special Lagrangian 
submanifolds:
 
Consider, for the resolved ,
 
implying the following special Lagragian submanifold:
 
Now, using the following -term constraint (there are three, of which one
considers the one involving ):
 
one gets the following Lagrangian submanifold equation:
 
Hence, from (), one sees that an equivalent charge vector
is:
 
The mirror corresponding to the Lagrangian submanifold () and
() is:
 

Returning back to the question of superpotential for the the 
theory, what needs to be worked out is the antiholomorphic involution on the type IIA side, its
image on the mirror type IIB side, and one should then be able to show that just like
there were no O-planes and hence no superpotential 
away from the orbifold singularities before the singularity resolution,
shown in section 4 , there can be no superpotential generated even after resolving
the orbifold singularities.
Additionally, it will be interesting to evaluate and match the Ka hler
potential on the Heterotic and  theory sides, and to take its -theory limit.
