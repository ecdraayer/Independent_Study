0. Introduction 
The role of -branes   in the description of certain
nonperturbative degrees of freedom of strings is by now well
established and the study of their dynamics has lead to many
new insights into string  and -theory  , .
Much of this study was done in the large volume regime where
geometric techniques provide reliable information. The extrapolation
into the stringy regime usually requires boundary conformal field
theory (CFT) methods. In this approach -brane configurations are
given by conformally invariant boundary states or boundary conditions.
However a complete microscopic description these configurations are well
understood only for the case of flat and toric backgrounds where
the CFT on the world sheet is a theory of free fields. Due to this
reason many calculations concerning the scattering and emission of
closed strings from -branes can be given exactly
(see for example  ,  ).

 The class of models of rational CFT gives the examples of curved
string backgrounds where the construction of the boundary states
leaving a whole chiral symmetry algebra unbroken can
be given in principle and the interaction of these states
with closed strings can be calculated exactly.
But in practice the calculation of closed string amplitudes is
available if the corresponding free field realization of
the model is known. Therefore, it is important to extend free
field approach to the case of rational models of CFT with a
boundary.

 This problem has been treated recently to the case of 
WZNW model in  , where the Wakimoto free field
realization of  Kac-Moody algebra  -  has
been used to boundary states construction.

  superconformal minimal models represent a subclass of
rational CFT which is most important in the string theory applications.
They are building blocks in Gepner models   which give
a solution by CFT methods of the problem of string propagation on
Calabi-Yau manifolds. The  minimal models
as suggested are fixed points of
 supersymmetric Landau-Ginzburg (LG) models  ,  .
This rigorously justified suggestion gives a possibility to
describe string propagation on Calabi-Yau manifold also in geometric
terms and provides a link between the algebraic structure encoded
in  minimal models and geometry of the manifold.
These mutually complementary approaches of CFT and LG are very efficient
also in investigation of -branes on Calabi-Yau manifolds
 - .

 The free field realization of
the unitary  super-Virasoro algebra representations has been
developed by Feigin and Semikhatov in  . From the one
hand, this realization is closely related  ,
  with Wakimoto free field description of  WZNW model.
From the other hand, it is related with LG approach to 
minimal models. It is interesting to extend the free field realization to
the case of  minimal models with boundaries
and investigate these relations in this case.

 In this note we extend the construction of   to the
case of  minimal models with  boundaries. In section 1,
we review the free field realization and butterfly resolution
  of Feigin and Semikhatov of the unitary modules in
 minimal
models and obtain free field representation for the characters.
In section 2, we construct a linear class of Fock
modules Ishibashi states of -types.
In section 3, we construct -type Ishibashi state for each
irreducible  minimal model module using superposition of
linear Ishibashi states of Fock modules from butterfly resolution.
The coefficients of the superposition are fixed by imposing
BRST invariance condition which is similar to that of the bulk
theory. At the end of the section we represent the free field construction
of boundary states using Cardy's prescription.
In the last section we briefly discuss free field representation for
boundary correlations functions as well as some generalizations of the
construction.

1. Free-field realization of  minimal models 
irreducible representations. 
In this section we briefly discuss free-field construction of
Feigin and Semikhatov   of the irreducible modules
in  superconformal minimal models.

1.1. Free-field representations of  super-Virasoro
algebra. 

  We introduce (in the left-moving sector) the free bosonic fields
 and free fermionic fields ,
so that its singular OPE's are given by
X^* (z_1 )X(z_2 )=(z_12 )+reg.,^* (z_1 )(z_2 )=z_12 ^-1 +reg,
where . Then for an arbitrary number
 the currents of  super-Virasoro
algebra are given by
G^+ (z)=^* (z)X(z) -1  ^* (z), 
G^- (z)=(z) X^* (z)-(z), J(z)=^* (z)(z)+1 X^* (z)-X(z), T(z)=X(z)X^* (z)+
12 (^* (z)(z)-^* (z)(z))-12 (^2  X(z)+1 ^2  X^* (z)),
and the central charge is
c=3(1-21 ).
 As usual, the fermions in NS sector are expanded into
half-integer modes:
(z)=_r1/2+Z [r]z^-12 -r ,
^* (z)=_r1/2+Z ^* [r]z^-12 -r ,G^ (z)=_r1/2+Z G^ [r]z^-32 -r ,
and they are expanded into integer modes in R sector:
(z)=_rZ [r]z^-12 -r ,
^* (z)=_rZ ^* [r]z^-12 -r ,G^ (z)=_rZ G^ [r]z^-32 -r .
The bosons  are expanded in both sectors into integer 
modes:
X(z)=_nZ X[n]z^-1-n ,
X^* (z)=_nZ X^* [n]z^-1-n ,J(z)=_nZ J[n]z^-1-n ,
T(z)=_nZ L[n]z^-2-n .
 To describe the modules of  Virasoro superalgebra in NS sector
we define the vacuum state  such that
[r]p,p^* >=^* [r]p,p^* >=0, r12 ,X[n]p,p^* >=X^* [n]p,p^* >=0, n1, X[0]p,p^* >=pp,p^* >, 
X^* [0]p,p^* >=p^* p,p^* >.
It is a primary state with respect
to the  Virasoro algebra
G^ [r]p,p^* >=0, r>0, J[n]p,p^* >=L[n]p,p^* >=0, n>0, J[0]p,p^* >=j p,p^* >=0, L[0]p,p^* >=h(h+2)-j^2 4 p,p^* >=0,
where , . The vacuum state
 corresponds to the vertex operator
 placed at .

We denote by 
the Fock module generated from the vector  by the fermionic
operators , , , and bosonic operators
, , .

 It is easy to
calculate the character  of the Fock module
. By the definition
_p,p^*  (q,u)=Tr_F_p,p^*   (q^L[0]-c24  u^J[0] ).
Thus we obtain
_p,p^*  (q,u)=
q^h(h+2)-j^2 +14  u^j +12  
(q,u)(q)^3  ,
where we have used the Jacobi theta-function
(q,u)=
q^18 _mZ q^12 (m^2 -m) u^-m 
and the Dedekind eta-function
(q)=q^124 _m=1 (1-q^m ).
 The  Virasoro algebra has the following set of automorphisms
which is known as spectral flow  G^ [r]G_t ^ [r]G^ [rt], L[n]L_t [n]L[n]+t J[n]+t^2 c6 _n,0 ,
J[n]J_t [n]J[n]+t c3 _n,0 ,
where . Note that spectral flow is intrinsic property
of  super-Virasoro algebra and hence, it does not depend on a
particular realization. Allowing in ()  to be
half-integer, we obtain the isomorphism between the NS and R
sectors.

 The spectral flow action on the free
fields can be easily described if we bosonise fermions 
(z)=(-y(z)),  ^* (z)=(+y(z)).
and introduce spectral flow vertex operator  U_t (z)=(-t(y+1 X^* -X)(z)).
The following OPE's
(z_1 )U_t (z_2 )=
z_12 ^t :(z_1 )U_t (z_2 ):, ^* (z_1 )U_t (z_2 )=
z_12 ^-t :^* (z_1 )U_t (z_2 ):, X^* (z_1 )U_t (z_2 )=z_12 ^-1 t U_t (z_2 )+r.,X(z_1 )U_t (z_2 )=-z_12 ^-1 t  U_t (z_2 )+r.
give the action of spectral flow on the modes of the free fields
[r][r-t], 
^* [r]^* [r+t], X^* [n]X^* [n]+t_n,0 , 
X[n]X[n]-t _n,0 .
 The action of the spectral flow on the vertex operator
 is given by the normal ordered product of the
vertex  and .

1.2. Irreducible  super-Virasoro representations
and butterfly resolution. 

 The  minimal models
are characterized by the condition that
 is integer and . In NS sector the irreducible
highest-weight modules, constituting the (left-moving) space of states of
the minimal model, are unitary and labeled by two integers ,
where  and .
The highest-weight vector  of the module satisfies the conditions
(which are similar to ())
G^ [r]w_h,j >=0, r>0, J[n]w_h,j >=L[n]w_h,j >=0, n>0, J[0]w_h,j >=j w_h,j >, L[0]w_h,j >=h(h+2)-j^2 4 w_h,j >.
If in addition to the conditions () the relation
G^+ [-1/2]w_h,j >=0
is satisfied we call the vector  and the module 
chiral highest-weight vector (chiral primary state) and chiral module,
correspondingly. In this case we have .
Analogously, anti-chiral highest-weight vector (anti-chiral primary
state) and anti-chiral
module can be defined if instead of ()
G^- [-1/2]w_h,j >=0
is satisfied. In this case .
In   the highest-weight vectors satisfying ()
are called massive highest-weight vectors and the vectors
satisfying in addition to ()
are called topological highest-weight vectors. In this paper we
prefer to use the terms introduced in  .

 To construct minimal model irreducible representations one needs to
introduce the integer lattice of the momentums:
P=(p,p^* )p,p^* Z
and the space
F_P =_(p,p^* )P F_p,p^*  .
Following   we introduce two fermionic screening currents
 and the charges  of the currents
S^+ (z)=^* (X^* )(z), 
S^- (z)=(X)(z), Q^ =dz S^ (z)
These charges commute with the generators of  super-Virasoro algebra
() and act in the space . Moreover they are
nilpotent and mutually anticommute
(Q^+ )^2 =(Q^- )^2 =Q^+ ,Q^- =0.
Due to these properties one can combine the charges  into
BRST operator acting in  and build a BRST complex
consisting of Fock modules  such that its cohomology
is given by NS sector   minimal model irreducible module .
This complex has been constructed in  .

 Let us consider first free field construction
for the chiral module . In this case the complex
(which is known due to Feigin and Semikhatov as butterfly resolution )
can be represented by the following diagram
  The horizontal arrows in this diagram are given by the action of
 and vertical arrows are given by the action of .
The diagonal arrow at the middle of butterfly resolution
is given by the action of  (which equals 
due to ()). Ghost number operator  of this complex
is defined for an arbitrary vector 
 by
gv_n,m >=(n+m)v_n,m >,  if  n,m0, gv_n,m >=(n+m+1)v_n,m >,  if  n,m< 0.
For an arbitrary vector of the complex  with the
ghost number  the differential  is defined
by
d_k v_N >=(Q^+ +Q^- )v_N >,  if  N-1, d_N v_N >=Q^+ Q^- v_N >,  if  N=-1.
and rises the ghost number by 1.

Theorem 1.1.  . Complex () is exact
except at the  module, where the cohomology is given by
the chiral module .

 The butterfly resolution allows to write the character
 of the
module  as the Euler charcteristic of the complex:
_h (q,u)=^(l) _h (q,u)-^(r) _h (q,u), ^(l) _h (q,u)=_n,m0 (-1)^n+m _n,h+m (q,u),^(r) _h (q,u)=_n,m> 0 (-1)^n+m _-n,h-m (q,u),
where  and  are the characters
of the left and right wings of the resolution.

 To obtain the resolutions for other (anti-chiral and non-chiral) modules
we note first that all irreducible modules can be obtained
from the chiral modules ,  by the spectral flow
action  . It turns out that one can get
all the resolutions by the spectral flow action also.
Indeed, the charges
 commute with spectral flow operator  as it is
easy to see from the corresponding OPE's, hence, the resolutions
in NS sector are generated from () by the operators
, . The resolutions in R sector are
generated from the resolutions in NS sector by the spectral flow
operator .

 To illustrate how it works we consider the Fock module  from
the middle of the resolution. The vector ,  represents 
super-Virasoro algebra chiral highest-weight vector 
of the module . The vector 
 represents a cohomology class, hence
it is in irreducible module . Acting on this vector by
the operator  we obtain the vector ,
which is  super-Virasoro algebra highest-weight vector 
of the module . Analogously, the vector

represents another vector from irreducible module .
Acting on this vector by  we obtain the vector
, which is  super-Virasoro algebra
highest-weight vector  of the module . Going
by this way further, we arrive at the end the vector
,
which is anti-chiral highest-weight vector  of the
anti-chiral module . The
modules from R sector can be generated analogously.


2. Ishibashi states in the Fock modules of 
super- Virasoro algebra. 

 The boundary states we are going to construct can be considered
as a bilinear forms on the space of states of the model. Thus, it
will be implied in what follows that the right-moving sector of
the model is realized by the free-fields

, and the right-moving
 super-Virasoro algebra is given by the formulas similar to
()

 There are two types of boundary states preserving 
super-Virasoro algebra  , usually called -type
(L[n]-L [-n])B>>=(J[n]+J [-n])B>>=0, (G^+ [r]+G ^+ [-r])B>>=
(G^- [r]+G ^- [-r])B>>=0
and -type states
(L[n]-L [-n])A>>=(J[n]-J [-n])A>>=0, (G^+ [r]+G ^- [-r])A>>=
(G^- [r]+G ^+ [-r])A>>=0
where .

 In the tensor product
of the left-moving Fock module  and right-moving Fock
module  we construct the most
simple states fulfilling the solutions () and
(). We shall call these states as linear Ishibashi states and denote by .

 Let us consider -type linear Ishibashi states in NS sector.
They can be easily obtained from the following ansatz for fermions
(^* [r]-
a ^* [-r])p,p^* ,p ,p ^* ,,B>>=0, ([r]-
b [-r])p,p^* ,p ,p ^* ,,B>>=0
where  are the arbitrary constants. Substituting these relations
into () and using () we find
a=b=, p =-p-1 ,  p ^* =-p^* -1, (X[n]+X [-n]+1 _n,0 )
p,p^* ,p ,p ^* ,,B>>=0, (X^* [n]+X ^* [-n]+_n,0 )
p,p^* ,p ,p ^* ,,B>>=0.
Thus, the linear -type Ishibashi state in NS sector is given by the
standard expression  ,  , p,p^* ,,B>>=
_n=1 (-1n (X^* [-n]X [-n]+X[-n]X ^* [-n])) _r=1/2 ((^* [-r] [-r]+
[-r] ^* [-r]))p,p^* ,-p-1 ,-p^* -1>.
The closed string cylinder amplitude between such states in NS sector
is given by
<<p_2 ,p^* _2 ,,Bq^L[0]-c/24 u^J[0] p_1 ,p^* _1 ,,B>>=(p_1 -p_2 )
(p^* _1 -p^* _2 )_p_1 ,p^* _1  (q,u).
Note that the state  is defined in such
a way to satisfy conjugate boundary conditions and to take into account
the charge asymmetry  - of the free-field realization of the minimal model.

 The linear -type Ishibashi states can be found analogously.
We start from the ansatz for fermions
(^* [r]-
a [-r])p,p^* ,p ,p ^* ,,A>>=0, ([r]-
b ^* [-r])p,p^* ,p ,p ^* ,,A>>=0
where  are the arbitrary constants. Then we find
a=,  b= , p =-1+p^*  ,  p ^* =-p-1, (X[n]+X ^* [-n]+_n,0 )
p,p^* ,p ,p ^* ,,A>>=0, (X^* [n]+X [-n]+_n,0 )
p,p^* ,p ,p ^* ,,A>>=0.
Hence the linear -type Ishibashi state (in NS sector) is given by
p,p^* ,,A>>=
_n=1 (-1n (X[-n]X [-n]+1 X^* [-n]X ^* [-n])) _r=1/2 ((1 ^* [-r] ^* [-r]+
[-r] [-r]))p,p^* ,-1+p^*  ,-p-1>
and the corresponding closed string cylinder amplitude
coincide with the ().

 Note that -type Ishibashi state () can be obtained
from -type Ishibashi state () by the Mirror
involution  in the right-moving sector:
X [n]=1 X ^* [n], 
X ^* [n]=X [n],  [r]=1  ^* [r], 
 ^* [r]= [r].
3. Boundary states in  minimal models. 
3.1. Ishibashi states in the irreducible modules of 
super-Virasoro algebra. 

 Free-field realization of the
irreducible representations described in the Sec. 1. allows to
suggest that the Ishibashi states of the modules 
can also be represented by the free fields. Moreover, the relations
(), () indicate that one can built
these states by the linear Ishibashi states of the Fock modules.

 Let us consider the following
superposition of -type free-field Ishibashi states
M_h,h ,,B>>=_n,m0 c_n,m n,m+h,,B>>+
_n,m>0 c_-n,-m -n,-m+h,,B>>,
where the summation is performed over the momentums
from the butterfly resolution (). It is easy to see that
this state satisfies the relations (). The arbitrary
coefficients  and  can be fixed partly
from the condition
<<M_h',h' ,,B(-1)^g q^L[0]-c/24 u^J[0] M_h,h ,,B>>=
_h',h _h (q,u).
Indeed, using () one can find
<<M_h',h' ,,B(-1)^g q^L[0]-c/24 u^J[0] M_h,h ,,B>>=_h',h (_n,m0 (-1)^n+m c_n,m ^2 _n,h+m (q,u)-
_n,m>0 (-1)^n+m c_-n,-m ^2 _-n,h-m (q,u)).
Comparing with () we find
c_n,m ^2 =c_-n,-m ^2 =1.
Thus, the state () is a good candidate for free-field
realization (in NS sector) of -type Ishibashi state of the chiral
module . It would be a genuine Ishibashi state if it did
not radiate nonphysical closed string states which are present in the
free field representation of the model. In other words, the overlap of
this state with an
arbitrary closed string state which does not belong to
the Hilbert space of the  minimal model should vanish. As we will see
this condition can be formulated as a  invariance condition
of the state () and it will fix the coefficients
,  up to the common factor.

 The states which can interract with the Ishibashi state
() come from the product of left-moving and right-moving
Fock modules
, where
 or . The left-moving modules of the superposition
() constitute the
butterfly resolution () whose cohomology is given by
the irreducible chiral module . What about the Fock modules from
the right-moving sector? It turns out that the
right-moving Fock modules constitute the dual butterfly resolution:
  The arrows on this diagram are given by the same operators as on
the diagram (). We define the ghost number operator
 of the complex similar to the ghost number operator of the
complex (). For an arbitrary vector 
 by
g v _n,m >=(n+m)v_n,m >,  if  n,m0, g v_n,m >=(n+m-1)v_n,m >,  if  n,m> 0.
The differentials  are defined similar to
().

Theorem 3.1.  Complex () is exact
except at the  module, where the cohomology is
given by the anti-chiral module .

 The proof of this theorem is similar to that one is given in
 . Thus, one can form
the tensor product of complexes () and
() to form the complex
C_h,h ^-2 C_h,h ^-1 C_h,h ^0 C_h,h ^+1 ,
which is graded by the sum of the ghost numbers
 and for an arbitrary ghost number 
the space  is given by the sum of products of the
Fock modules from the resolution () and ()
such that . The differential  of the complex
()is defined by the differentials  and
 of the complexes () and ()
D_i v_N v _N  >=d_N v_N v _N  >+
(-1)^N v_N d _N  v _N  >,
where  is an arbitrary vector from the complex ()
with ghost number , while  is an
arbitrary vector from the complex () with the ghost
number  and .
It follows from the Theorems (1.1) and (3.1) that the cohomology

of the complex () is nonzero only at grading 0
and is given by the product of irreducible modules
.

 The Ishibashi state we are looking for
can be considerd as a linear functional on the Hilbert space of
 superconformal minimal model, then it has to be an element
of the homology group . Therefore, the  invariance
condition for the state can be formulated as follows.

 Let us define the action of the differential  on the state
 by the formula
<<D^* M_h,h ,,Bv_N v _N  ><<M_h,h ,,BD_N+N  v_N v _N  >,
where  is an arbitrary element
from . Then,  invariance condition
means that
D^* M_h,h ,,B>>=0.
Theorem 3.2.  Superposition () satisfies
 invariance condition () if the coefficients
,  of the superposition obey the equations
c_n,m =c_0,0 ,  if  n+m=2k  and  n,m0, c_n,m =-c_0,0 ,  if  n+m=2k+1  and  n,m0, c_-n,-m =c_0,0 ,  if  -n-m+1=2k+1  and  n,m>0, c_-n,-m =-c_0,0 ,  if  -n-m+1=2k  and  n,m>0.
Thus the coefficients depends on the ghost number .

 Proof. In view of (, ) and because of
differential  rises the ghost number by 1, only  images of the
states  have nonzero overlap
with Ishibashi state . Thus, one needs to show that
<<M_h,h ,,BD_-1 v_N v _-1-N >= <<M_h,h ,,Bd_N v_N v _-1-N >
+(-1)^N <<M_h,h ,,B d _-1-N )v_N v _-1-N >=0.
It will be implied during the proof that the state
 corresponds to the field
 which is placed
at the center  of the unit disk.

 1)Let  and hence  and  belong to the left
wings of resolutions () and (). Using
relations () and () as well as the
definitions (), () one can rewrite the
first term from () as
<<M_h,h ,,Bd_N v_N v _-1-N >=<<M_h,h ,,B((X^* _0 -X ^* _0 )Q ^+ +
(((X_0 -X _0 ))Q ^- )v_N v _-1-N >,
where , , ,  are
the constant modes canonicaly conjugated to the momentums
, , , . The operators
, 
only shift the momentums in the components of the superposition
. From the other hand we can decompose the vectors
 and  according to their components
in the Fock modules of the resolutions
v_N >=y_N,h >+y_N-1,h+ >+...+y_0,h+N >,v _-1-N >=y _-1-N-1 ,-1-h >+
y _-N-1 ,-1-h+ >+...
+y _-1 ,-1-h+(N+1) >
Substitution of this decomposition into the each term of the equation
() gives the first and second relations from
().

 2)Let  and hence  and  belong to the
vertexes of the right wings of resolutions. Using
relations () and () as well as the
definitions (), () one can rewrite the
first term from () as
<<M_h,h ,,Bd_-1 v_-1 v _0 >=<<M_h,h ,,B(X^* _0 -X ^* _0 )((X_0 -X _0 ))
Q ^+ Q ^- v_-1 v _0 >.
Substitution of this decomposition into the each term of the equation
() gives the third relation from
() for .

 3)Let  and hence  and  belong to the
right wings of resolutions. Similar to the case  we obtain
the last two relations from (). It proves the
theorem.

 Note that the state (, ) is not
-exact due to ().
Hence, it represents a homology class from .Thus, it is
 minimal model Ishibashi state
in NS sector modulo -exact states. Note also that normalization phases  can not be
fixed by the  invariance condition. We fix the normalization of
each Isibashi state by .

 Due to the arguments from the Sec.1 we can
obtain free field construction of the remainder  minimal model
-type Ishibashi states in NS sector applying to the Ishibashi state
 the spectral flow operators , where
. Then, the action by the spectral flow operator
 on the Ishibashi
states from the NS sector gives free field construction of
-type Ishibashi states in R sector. It is also clear that
free field construction of -type Ishibashi states in 
minimal models can be obtained from -type Ishibashi states
by the Mirror involution ().

3.2. Boundary states. 

 The boundary states in NS or R sector can be
constructed by applying Cardy's prescription   to free field
realized Ishibashi states.

 Let us denote by  the S-matrix of modualr
transformation of the full characters of  minimal model in NS sector:
_h,j (q,0)=_h',j' S_(h,j),(h',j') _h',j' (q ,0),S_(h,j),(h',j') =
12  ((h+1)(h'+1) )(jj' ).
where , .
The Ishibashi states we have constructed corresponds to the full
characters of the algebra. It is easy to relate them with the
standard Ishibashi states , where  in NS sector
and  in R sector (the notations see for example in  ).
For instance, this relation for -type Ishibashi
states is given by
M_h,j ,+,A>>=h,j,0,A>>+h,j,2,A>>, M_h,j ,-,A>>=h,j,0,A>>-h,j,2,A>>,
in NS sector and it is given by
U_12 U _12 M_h,j ,+,A>>=h,j,-1,A>>+h,j,1,A>>, U_12 U _12 M_h,j ,-,A>>=h,j,-1,A>>-h,j,1,A>>,
in R sector.
Then Cardy's prescription in NSNS sector gives the following boundary states
D_h,j ,,A>>=
_h',j' D_(h,j),(h',j') M_h',j' ,,A>>,
while in RR sector it gives
D_h,j ,,A>>=
_h',j' D_(h,j),(h',j') U_12 U _12 M_h',j' ,+,A>>,
where
D_(h,j),(h',j') =S_(h,j),(h',j') S_(0,0),(h',j')   .
-type boundary states can be represented analogously.


4. Discussion 

 In this note we represented free field construction
of  invariant Ishibashi states
in  superconformal minimal models using free field realization
of  super-Virasoro algebra unitary modules.
Each Ishibashi state of the model is given by
infinite superposition of linear Ishibashi states of Fock modules,
forming butterfly resolution of irreducible representation. It is shown that
coefficients of the superposition are fixed by the  invariance condition
and the Ishibashi state constructed this way is not  exact.
We group these free field realized Ishibashi
states into the boundary states of  minimal model using the
solution found by Cardy. Due to  invariance the boundary states
do not radiate non-physical closed string states (which are present
originally in the free field space of states).

 We close with a brief discussion of some
directions to develop. The first one is a free field
construction for boundary correlation functions. This problem is
rather technical in fact because all needed ingredients are known.
Indeed, the boundary states has been constructed in the present
note. The free field description of the irreducible representations,
vertex operators and the screening charge generating quantum
group structure of the conformal blocks (note that the fermionic
screenings  of the butterfly resolution have trivial
braiding relations) are known from  . The 
screening charge is
nothing else the standard Wakimoto screening charge (the one
involved in the costruction of Felder-type resolution
 ) of  WZNW model. In terms of our free fields it
is given by the following integral of the (bosonic) screening current:
Q_W =dz S_W (z), 
S_W =
(X^* +^* )(-1 X^* -X).
It is easy to check that  commutes with 
super-Virasoro algebra and fermionic charges .
We hope to develop free field representation of the boundary
correlation functions in future publication.

 The second obviously important direction is the generalization of
our boundary state construction to the case of product of
 minimal models and to Gepner models.

 Free field approach is also applies to  superconformal
models with -algebra of symmetries. Some of them is believed
to coincide with Kazama-Suzuki models  .  minimal models
is the simplest example of this situation when Kazama-Suzuki model is 
 coset. Therefore,
it would be interesting to extend our free field construction of
-branes to more general class of Kazama-Suzuki models.
