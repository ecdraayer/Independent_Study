The most fruitful approach to studying low energy soliton dynamics in field
theories of Bogomol'nyi type is the geodesic approximation of Manton. In the
case of vortices and monopoles, Stuart has obtained rigorous estimates
of the errors in this approximation, and hence proved that it is valid in the
low speed regime. His method employs energy estimates which rely on a key
coercivity property of the Hessian of the energy functional of the theory
under consideration. In this paper we prove an analogous coercivity property
for the Hessian of the energy functional of a general sigma model with
compact Kahler domain and target. We go on to prove a continuity property
for
our result, and show that, for the  model on , the Hessian
fails to be globally coercive in the degree  sector. We present numerical
evidence which suggests that the Hessian is globally coercive in a certain
equivariance class of the degree  sector for . We also prove
that, within the geodesic approximation, a single  lump moving on
 does not generically travel on a great circle.



Introduction 
Many field theories arising naturally in theoretical high energy physics may
be said to be of Bogomol'nyi type. For such theories there is a topological
lower bound on the energy of field configurations, and this bound is attained
only by solutions of a first order "self-duality" equation, the so-called
solitons of the theory. The solitons are stable by virtue of their
energy-minimizing property, and are generically spatially localized lumps of
energy with strongly particle-like characteristics. When static they exert
no net force on one another, so the structure of the space of static
multisoliton solutions is rather rich. Examples within the context of gauge
theory are given by the Yang-Mills-Higgs and abelian-Higgs models, whose
solitons are called monopoles and vortices respectively. In both these cases,
the static models are very well understood and the structure of ,
the
moduli space of static -soliton solutions, is known in great detail.
For monopoles, in particular, the static system is integrable and there are
several constructions which generate exact solutions of various degrees of
explicitness. Once one introduces time dependence, however, things get much
more difficult. No Bogomol'nyi type field theory (indeed, no Lorentz
invariant
field theory) in more than  dimensions is integrable, and the
construction of nontrivial exact time-dependent solutions seems
impossible.

How then is one to understand the dynamics of moving solitons in
these models?
The most fruitful approach
has turned out to be the geodesic approximation of Manton
. Here one argues
on physical grounds that the solution of
any initial value problem in the -soliton
sector whose initial field is a static solution, and whose initial kinetic
energy is small, should be forced to stay close to 
 by energy conservation. Manton suggested that the
dynamics should be well approximated by a solution of the reduced
variational problem where the field configuration is constrained  to
lie on  at all times. This reduced dynamics turns out to be geodesic
flow on  with respect to a natural metric called the  metric, so
one has the appealing suggestion that low energy soliton dynamics in
Bogomol'nyi type theories may be understood by studying the Riemannian
geometry of their moduli spaces. This is still a highly nontrivial problem,
and it was some time before the  metrics on the 2-monopole and 2-vortex
moduli spaces were well understood
. Since first being proposed, the method
of Manton has been extended to deal with dynamical issues other than
classical multisoliton scattering. Quantum soliton states
 are thought to be
well approximated by eigenstates of the Laplacian on , for example,
and the thermodynamics of soliton gaseshas been analyzed in terms of the
geometry of .

Not all Bogomol'nyi type field theories are gauge theories. Another class is
given by nonlinear sigma models with Kahler target space, for example the
 models. These models are nonlinear in the most fundamental way: the
field takes values in a space with no linear structure. However they have
many features in common with the gauge theories mentioned above. There is
again a topological lower bound on energy, attained only by solutions of
a first order partial differential equation, namely the -holomorphic
maps - the Cauchy-Riemann conditions play the role of the self-duality
equation. The static model is integrable and the structure of  is
again well understood. The solitons in this case are usually called
"lumps."

Given the similarities between lumps and their gauge theoretic
counterparts, it was natural for Ward to suggest, in the specific context of
the  model on the plane, that the geodesic approximation should be
applicable to classical lump dynamics too. A detailed numerical
analysis of 2-lump scattering within the geodesic approximation followed
, as well as generalizations to the  models.
One technical problem encountered in all these studies is that  lumps
have -infinite zero modes on , so the  metric is only
well-defined on the leaves of a foliation of , rather than 
itself. One interprets this physically as saying that certain parameters in
the static -lump solution are frozen to constant values by infinite
inertia. For example, the width of a single  lump is a free
parameter, but is frozen in this fashion. Unfortunately, this freezing
appears to be an artifact of the approximation - numerical solutions suggest
that a single lump may expand or contract according to the genuine field
dynamics. So the geodesic approximation is rather pathological for these
models. It is therefore interesting to consider situations where physical
space is compact, since the  metric is then guaranteed to be
well-defined.
In particular,  lumps on  and  have been studied, and quite
a lot is known about the corresponding  geometries
.

The question remains, of course, whether geodesic flow in  really does
closely approximate low-energy -lump dynamics in these theories. For
2-vortex and 2-monopole dynamics, rigorous results supporting the geodesic
approximation have been proved by Stuart. He has shown that
the solution with initial data , 
 of order  (where  is small), stays
pointwise close (order )
to its corresponding geodesic in  for a time of order .
The key idea in Stuart's analysis is to separate the dynamics into slow
and fast time-varying modes by means of the following projection: the
true solution  is projected onto  to obtain a slow
trajectory 
1 
(t)= (t)+^2 V(t)
and a fast varying "error" , the projection being chosen so that
 is always  orthogonal to . Stuart
goes on to prove that an appropriate Sobolev norm of  remains bounded
for times of order  by bounding this norm in terms of
, the quadratic form associated with the second variation
of the potential energy functional of the model, which is slowly varying by
virtue of energy conservation. It follows that, as expected, the true
solution remains close to .
That the projected trajectory 
remains close to geodesic is proved as a separate step.

The whole analysis relies on one's ability to control Sobolev norms of the
error in terms of the Hessian. More precisely, the following
coercivity property of  is crucial:


There exists a constant  such that for all 
and all  with ,
. 


This turns out to be slightly easier to prove for vortices than monopoles
since the  spectrum of small oscillations about a static vortex has a
mass gap due to the Higgs mechanism. No such gap occurs for monopoles.

How much of this framework carries over to sigma models? Since the target
space has no linear structure, equation () makes no sense as it
stands, and must be replaced. We suggest here that the correct replacement
is
(t)=_ (t) ^2 V(t)
where  is the exponential map on the target space . Once
again, we should choose  always to be  orthogonal to
. In this context, we will prove an analogue
of Stuart's coercivity lemma for any holomorphic map  between
compact Kahler manifolds, namely, there exists  such
that
for all
, 
,
_  (V,V)( )
V_H^1 ^2.
The important difference from Stuart's result is that the constant 
depends on , that is, varies with position in . We may
define the optimal constant
( )=
_  (V,V) V_H^1 ^2 : V0,
V_L^2 T_  >0.
We prove a result (Theorem ) which gives sufficient conditions
that  depend continuously on , and verify that those
conditions hold
in the main examples of interest to us. It turns out that
 for sigma models is generically non-compact, so continuity of
 does not guarantee a global bound.
 In fact, we will show by means of an explicit counterexample, that
 is not  necessarily bounded away from zero. The
counterexample occurs in the simplest nontrivial case, namely the one-lump
moduli space of the  model on , but we believe it is indicative
of a generic phenomenon for the  models on any compact Riemann
surface. Roughly speaking,  as the lump 
shrinks to zero size. One would expect this to happen quite generically in
, wherever a family of holomorphic maps degenerates so that a single
isolated lump collapses. This suggests we are never likely to have a global
bounding constant  on   as obtained by Stuart for
vortices and monopoles. Consequently, the best result one could hope for
from an analysis of this type for lumps is that the geodesic approximation
is good for a time of order , where  is some increasing
function of . In this case, the
approximation would work well (in the usual sense)
so long as the projected geodesic stays away from
, the
boundary at infinity of ,
 where . In particular it seems very unlikely that geodesic
flow provides a good approximation to the process of single lump collapse
itself. Two independent numerical studies of singularity formation in the
 model on the plane
 support this pessimistic assessment.

If we impose extra symmetry on our system, in other words, restrict attention
to an admissible equivariance class,
then the projected
map  is confined to a totally geodesic submanifold  of
,
and the error  is confined
to an infinite dimensional subspace  of .
We may define an equivariant version  of  by taking
the infimum only over sections . Clearly 
. For a certain equivariance class for
-lump dynamics in the  model on , one can prove that
 is
continuous on , which is again noncompact.
We will present numerical evidence
 that  is  globally bounded
away from zero for  in this class.
The point is that only coincident 
-lump collapse can
occur within this particular
equivariance class, and the problem of vanishing 
does not appear to happen for such collapse. It is possible, therefore,
that the geodesic approximation does give a good model of equivariant
multilump collapse, though one should be cautious: there is ample scope for
other aspects of Stuart's method to break down as singularities form. There
are some grounds for optimism. A recent careful numerical study of lump
collapse by Linhart and Sadun found that single lump collapse on the plane
differed significantly from that predicted by a truncated geodesic
approximation, while coincident 2-lump collapse did not.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In section we introduce the nonlinear sigma models of interest and briefly review
some of their standard properties. We focus in particular on the 
model
on , describing what is known about the  geometry on  in this
case, especially for . We present a new result on generic behaviour of
the geodesic flow in  which implies that (within the geodesic
approximation) a single lump generically does not  travel along great
circles on . Precise restrictions on the set of non-generic initial
data are given. In section  we formulate and prove
the main result of the
paper, that the Hessian for these models is coercive on , in the sense
described above. In section  we establish a simple sufficient
condition for  to depend continuously on .
In section  we show that this condition is met in the case of
 for the  model on . We go on to prove that 
as  approaches , so global coercivity fails in
this
case. Finally, in section  we consider the case of the -lump
sector of the  model on  within a given equivariance class,
showing that  is continuous. We conjecture that  is
globally coercive for  and present some numerical results in support
of this conjecture.

The  model on  
For our purposes, a nonlinear sigma model consists of a single field
, where  and  are compact Kahler
manifolds,  represents physical space,  is spacetime, equipped
with the Lorentzian pseudometric  and  is the target space.
Solutions of the model are local extremals of the action
S[]=1 2 _M 
_dE_^2 E_^2 =_(_M
 ^2-E[])
where  is an orthonormal basis of vector
fields on  and  is the harmonic map energy functional
for maps . Such solutions are called wave maps in the geometric
analysis literature, by analogy with harmonic maps
. Indeed, static wave
maps are precisely harmonic maps and hence have been the focus of intense
study. In particular, Lichnerowicz showed that if a homotopy class 
contains -holomorphic representatives, then these minimize energy within
that class
. So the moduli space of interest within a given class is
. For the sake of generality, we will state
and prove the coercivity lemma for the Hessian in this general context.

It is important when using the geodesic approximation  to know that

is a finite dimensional smooth manifold. This is not always true in the
general case of holomorphic maps between Kahler manifolds.
We discuss this question in more
detail in section ,
briefly summarizing some results in the harmonic maps and algebraic geometry
literature which allow us to identify classes of sigma model whose
moduli spaces are smooth manifolds.
For the moment we note that
 the particular case we have most directly in mind,
namely , the  model on the two-sphere, certainly does have
this property.

We now consider the case  in more detail.
Each homotopy class  is labelled by the degree of
, an integer , which without loss of generality we may assume is
non-negative. The degree  is interpreted physically as the net lump
number of the configuration . The space  of degree 
holomorphic maps  is easily constructed explicitly. Choosing
stereographic coordinates  on both  and , such a map is
rational of degree ,
:zW=a_1z^n++a_n+1  a_n+2 z^n++a_2n+2  
where  are  complex constants,  and  do not both
vanish, and the numerator and denominator have no common roots. Since
 and  give the same
map for all , we have a natural identification of
 with a dense open subset of , whence it inherits a natural
topology and complex structure.

The metric of interest , does not descend from the inclusion
 however. To define it, one must think of a tangent
vector  as a zero mode of the Cauchy-Riemann equations for
maps  at the map . Such a zero mode is a smooth section of
, the pullback of the tangent bundle of  by the map ,
that is, a rule which assigns to each  a vector
.
We may define the  inner product between any pair of sufficiently
regular sections  of  by taking their fibrewise inner product
in , then integrating over ,
X,Y_L^2  =_M h(X,Y).
The  metric on  is simply the restriction of 

to zero modes. In more concrete terms, one can in principle compute
explicit formulae for  by choosing local coordinates  on
 (for example, the real and imaginary parts of , on the
chart where ) and expressing the map  as an
explicit
function , so that
ij _ij dq^idq^j,_ij =_dzdz  (1+z^2)^2 1 (1+W^2)^2 
W q^i W  q^j .
In practice, of course, the integrals involved are almost always intractable.

Certainly, the  metric is a natural way of geometrizing . More
importantly, it is the Riemannian metric descending from the restriction of
the kinetic energy functional  to , and
hence
the metric whose geodesics are thought to model slow lump dynamics. We shall
briefly review what is known about the Riemannian manifold ,
and prove a new result about the generic behaviour of geodesics in 
.

First,  is manifestly Hermitian, and is in fact Kahler. This
was long suspected, owing to a rather general formal argument of Ruback
, and
has recently been proved rigorously. It is also known that
 is geodesically incomplete. For odd ,
 contains a totally geodesic Lagrangian submanifold
naturally identified with the moduli space of static  -lumps on
; for  this submanifold is also incomplete.

There is an
isometric action of  on , induced by the natural
 actions on the domain and target spheres, which on  has
cohomogeneity 1 (generic  orbits have codimension 1), and in fact, almost
completely determines . Consequently, an explicit formula for
 is known in this case, and the geometry is particularly well
understood. For , the no common roots condition on the rational map
 is , so we may identify each
map with a projective equivalence class 
of  matrices. Hence
. By identifying  with the unit sphere in
 in the usual way, we may identify the  action on
 with the adjoint  action, so that  regarded as a metric
on  is invariant under the left and right  actions:
([U_1],[U_2]):[L][U_1LU_2].
Now every  has a unique polar decomposition
[L]=[U(1+^2 _2+)]
where ,
, and  are the
Pauli spin matrices. Hence .
Physically, the lump corresponding to  has maximum
energy density
 at , sharpness proportional to  and
internal orientation . The  lumps have uniform energy
density. The  action in this coordinate system is
([U_1],[U_2]):([U],)([U_1UU_2],Ad_U_2 )
where again we have used  to identify the fundamental

action on  with the adjoint  action on . From this we
see that the -orbits are level sets of , generically
diffeomorphic
to  (when ), the only exception being
,
which is diffeomorphic to .

In it was proved that every  invariant Kahler metric on
 may be written
dd+A_2(d)^2+
A_3 +A_4()^2+A_1(d)
where  are smooth functions of  only, all determined
from the single function  by the relations
A_2=A() 1+^2 +A'()  ,
A_3=1 4 (1+2^2)A(),
A_4=1 4 (1+^2)A'().
Here  are the left invariant one forms on
 dual to the basis  for 
.  For the  metric, one finds that
Adef 
A=4[^4-4^2(^2-1)^3 ,
1+^2 +)^2.
It follows from these formulae that  has finite volume and
diameter, is Ricci positive and has unbounded scalar and holomorphic
sectional curvatures. Examining the large  behaviour of ,
one finds that , the boundary at infinity of  is
. This is natural in two ways: a point in 
should be thought of as a collapsed lump whose width has shrunk to zero.
Such a lump is specified by a pair of points  in  because
every point except one, , in the domain gets mapped to the same point
 in the codomain, while  gets mapped to the antipodal point .
Second, the complex codimension 1 algebraic variety 
complementary to  in  is biholomorphic to ,
being the image of the holomorphic embedding
([x_1,x_2],[y_1,y_2])[x_1y_2,x_1y_1,x_2y_2,x_2y_1].
Since ,  lies at finite
proper distance, so geodesics may reach it in finite time, the origin of the
incompleteness already noted. Given that  has (real)
codimension
2, however, one would expect geodesics to miss  generically.
More precisely, one would expect the subset of  consisting of initial
data of geodesics which do  escape to infinity to have zero measure
with respect to the natural measure inherited from .

Geodesic flow in  was studied in detail in. It
turns out to be surprisingly complicated given the homogeneity and isotropy
of the domain of the sigma model, . Geodesics were found for which the
lump spins internally and oscillates between antipodal points. Other
geodesics were found where the lump travels along a great circle in
, its speed and shape undergoing complicated periodic oscillations.
Geodesics do exist for which the lump simply traverses a great circle at
constant speed and shape, but the initial data to generate such motion must
be chosen very carefully. Nevertheless, all the geodesics found in
 confined the lump's position  to  some
great circle for all time. More precisely, they all confined  to
some plane through the origin. The geodesics themselves were obtained by
reducing the geodesic problem to  low dimensional totally geodesic
submanifolds, the fixed point sets of discrete isometries. The question
arises, then, whether this "planar property" of the geodesic flow
is an artifact of the exceptional symmetries enjoyed by these geodesics,
or is a general feature of the dynamics.
We shall now prove that the former is the case.

By the  invariance of the metric, it suffices to determine which initial
velocities 
 at the point 
 tangent to the hypersurface
 generate geodesics which remain in .
We shall call such an initial velocity  a "good" vector.
Clearly the set of good initial velocities is conical
by time-scaling
invariance of geodesic flow. By this, we mean that if  is
good, so is every vector , , on the
ray containing . The question is then whether the link  of this
 cone of good velocity vectors, that is, its intersection with the unit
4-sphere in , has non-vanishing measure in .

  Let  generate a geodesic through  which
remains in . Then  lies in a codimension 1 cone in .
For generic , the link of this cone
is the suspension of a two-torus. There is at most a nowhere dense subset
of  on which the link of the cone is , two three-spheres
intersecting in an equatorial two-sphere.

Proof:  Let  be a nonvanishing (but not necessarily unit)
normal on . Then if
 remains in ,  for all .
Differentiating this at  and using the fact that  is
parallel for a geodesic, one finds that

, where  is the Levi-Civita connexion.
Hence,  must lie in the null space of the symmetric
bilinear form
B(u,v)=(u,_vN),
that is . Clearly this null space is conical.
We seek to understand the link of this cone.
In this case (), we may choose
N=A_3  _2 +1 2 A_1(-_3_1+
_1_3)
as our normal field, where  are the left-invariant vector fields
on  dual to .
We may compute  by extending  to vector
fields  on , then using the usual formula for 
and symmetry of , to yield
B(u,v)=1 2 
.N[(U,V)]_x(0) +1 2 (.[U,N]
_x(0) ,v)+1 2 (.[V,N]_x(0) ,u).
A straightforward but lengthy calculation then shows that
B=f_1()d_1_3+f_2()d_3_1+
f_3()_2_3
where
f_1=1 8 (1+^2)(2A+A'),f_2=-1 4 (1+2^2)A(A+A'),f_3=1 16 (1+^2)AA',
at the specific point . By computing
eigenvalues, one sees that, with respect to some orthonormal basis for
,
B(u,u)=f_2()(u_2^2-u_3^2)+f_1()^2+f_3()^2 (u_4^2
-u_5^2).
Note that
8f_1() 1+^2 =2A+A'>
2^1+1 ^2+1 A+A'=
(  _3 ,  _3 )>0
so  never vanishes. Consider the set 
. If  were dense at , then by continuity of
, there would be an open interval containing  such
that . Given the formula () 
clearly does not coincide with  on any
interval,
so no such  exists. Hence the set  is nowhere dense.

Let . By means of
a  dependent rescaling of the basis, we see that the null space is
the locus of the equation
u _2^2+u _4^2=u _3^2+u _5^2.
Clearly  may take any value, while
 lies on a cone in
 whose link is a two-torus. Alternatively, we may think of the
unit sphere in  as the suspension of the unit sphere in  along
the  direction. Then the intersection of the link of the
null space with each 3 sphere of constant  is a
scaled two-torus. Assembling the slices together we see that the whole null
space has a link which is topologically the suspension of a two-torus
. Either
way of viewing the null set, it is clearly a codimension 1 cone in

as claimed.

It remains to consider the non-generic case, , for which
. In this case, since ,
 the cone consists of all vectors for which
. The link is the intersection of  with the union of the
two orthogonal hyperplanes , which is manifestly a union of
two three-spheres intersecting in an equatorial two sphere ().



We should point out that  is a necessary but not
sufficient
condition for the geodesic with initial velocity  to stay in . It is
not certain that the cone of good velocities is all of 
,
therefore.
Given the explicit formula for , one would expect to be able to
improve the characterization of the non-generic subset of 
(on which  has link ) from nowhere dense to
discrete or finite. Indeed, one may check graphically that 
has only one solution ( to 3 decimal places), so
the nongeneric set consists of a single  orbit, , in
.

  Generically geodesics in  do not confine

 to a plane through .
Consequently, single lumps generically do not stay on
great circles while moving on .

Of course, this corollary refers to the lump dynamics within the geodesic
approximation. The question remains: does this give a good model of the full
field dynamics?

Coercivity of the Hessian 
We wish to consider the wave map problem for maps 
, where  are compact Kahler, and the initial data have
a certain Sobolev regularity and are close to holomorphic, in a sense to be
made precise. The eventual aim is to prove that such wave maps stay close
to  and that their closest trajectory in
 is close to a geodesic. In this section we will prove
the main analytic ingredient needed for such a programme, along the lines
of Stuart's work on vortices.

The first thing to note is that the Cauchy problem for such wave maps with
initial data  on the time slice
 is well posed, that is, has a unique solution in the
same Sobolev space, with  continuous,
at least on some open time interval,  by
work of Choquet-Bruhat. Here  denotes the space of
maps  which are  in the usual sense (
 are all ) and which take values on 
(isometrically embedded in ) almost everywhere.
For our purposes, it is convenient to use an alternative intrinsic
definition of , which is only well-defined
for . With this restriction
on ,  naturally has the structure of a Hilbert manifold.
Below we give a brief treatment of both the intrinsic definition
and the Hilbert manifold structure of . For a complete treatment
we refer the reader to Palais.

A map  is said to belong to  if for any
 and any chart  containing , and any chart
 containing , the map 
 belongs to . For this
notion to be well-defined we need to ensure that
composition by  diffeomorphisms on the left and on the right
takes an  map to an  map. For composition on the
right this is true without any restriction on . However, for
left composition the same result only holds if we assume
 (for a discussion of
both points see B.1.7 and B.1.9, p182).
From now on we make a standing assumption that 
, so that the intrinsic definition of 
given above makes sense.

We now exhibit the structure of an infinite
dimensional Hilbert manifold on .
Standard facts on embeddings of Sobolev spaces and the density of
smooth maps in Sobolev spaces prove the following:
There are continuous inclusions  and
the first inclusion has dense image. From the latter fact it follows that it is sufficient
to exhibit charts for  around only the  maps.


Given  the pullback bundle 
(i.e. the vector bundle over  whose fibre at  is the vector space )
comes equipped with a natural inner product  and compatible connexion ,
the pullback of the Levi-Civita connexion on . For any vector bundle  over compact 
equipped with an inner product  and compatible connection  there is a natural  inner product
on smooth sections of :
<V,W>_H^k =_M <V,W> +_M <V, W> ++
_M <^k V, ^kW>.
 is then defined as the set of finite  norm elements of the
completion of  with respect to the norm .
For  compact, this definition of  is equivalent
to the following alternative definition: given any choice
of local coordinates on  and associated bundle trivializations for ,
a section belongs to  if it is represented by locally
 functions in these trivializations. The difference
is that the connexion-dependent definition gives a preferred
inner product on , i.e.  is naturally
a Hilbert space.

The point is that  is the local model space for the
Hilbert manifold . For each , there is
a map  given by
,
where  is the exponential map on .
It can be shown that  maps a neighbourhood of  in the Hilbert space
 bijectively to a neighbourhood of  in .
Hence for each  there exists some ,
so that one can define a chart  based at  where

The local homeomorphism
 is simply given by . So we identify  maps close to 
with  sections of  by deforming : the deformed map
 maps each  to the point in  reached by travelling for
unit time along the geodesic with initial data .

It can be shown that for any two maps , 
the change of charts map


is a diffeomorphism between open sets in the Hilbert spaces  and .
It follows that the collection of charts 
defines a differentiable structure on  with local model a Hilbert space, i.e. 
is a Hilbert manifold. In fact, the differentiable structure can be shown
to be independent of the metric  on  used to define .

a fixed time, and we will denote the holomorphic base map of our local
chart in  by  rather than , to simplify notation.

Like the usual Laplacian (on functions or forms)  is a
positive self-adjoint operator. Positivity follows from the identity
pos 
_M h(V,^V)=_M_i h(_E_i ^V,
_E_i ^V).
We may define a (fibrewise linear) bundle map  on  by
^V=_i=1 ^m R^N(V,d E_i)d E_i

X,^_L^2 ,^The operator , called the Jacobi operator,
 is itself second order, linear, elliptic and self-adjoint.
 It follows immediately from
this formula that every harmonic map into a manifold of nonpositive sectional
curvature is weakly stable (meaning ).

In the case of interest to us, namely  compact Kahler,
and  holomorphic, one can obtain
a more useful and rather simpler formula for . First one defines
the Urakawa connexion on ,
(^V)(X):=^_J^MX V-J^N^_XV,
 being the almost complex structures on  and . Then

Weak stability of holomorphic maps follows immediately from ().

 should be thought of as the linearized Bogomol'nyi equation,
so every  is a zero mode of the
holomorphic map . For the geodesic approximation to make sense, the
space of holomorphic maps close to  must be a smooth manifold whose
tangent space at  equals .
Sections of  in the kernel of 
are called Jacobi fields along .
A Jacobi field is said to be integrable if it may
be generated by a variation of  through harmonic maps, and the map
itself is said to be Jacobi integrable if all its Jacobi fields have this
property.
A fundamental theorem of Adams and Simon
 states that a harmonic map 
between real analytic manifolds
is Jacobi integrable if and only if the space of  harmonic maps
 close to  is a smooth manifold with tangent space
 at . Similar results hold in suitable Sobolev spaces
of maps also.
 In the case where  are Kahler
(hence real analytic),
Lichnerowicz showed that all harmonic deformations of a holomorphic
map  are holomorphic, so the space of interest to us, the
space of
holomorphic  maps close to , is a smooth manifold with
tangent space  at , if and only if  is Jacobi
integrable. Jacobi integrability of harmonic maps is an active
 field of research whose current state is summarized in
. Particularly relevant to the present paper is a theorem of
Wood and Lemaire which states that every holomorphic map  is
Jacobi integrable. So the moduli space of holomorphic maps for the 
model on  is smooth with tangent space , as we
require. A similar result holds for degree  holomorphic maps
,  being a compact Riemann surface of genus ,
provided , by a standard application of the Riemann-Roch
theorem. So the -lump moduli space of the  model on  also
has the required property, with some low degree exceptions.

We may now state and prove our main result.

 [Coercivity of the Hessian] Let 
be a holomorphic
map between compact Kahler manifolds and  be the Hessian of
the harmonic map energy functional at . Then there exists a constant
 such that for all  with
,




Proof:  Both  and  are Hilbert spaces. We will use
 and  to denote strong and weak convergence respectively, the
space concerned being explicitly specified.
 Define the subset 
 and the quantity
()=_VS _(V,V)=_VS ^V
_L^2 ^2
0.
We claim that . Assume this is false. Then there exists
a sequence  such that .
We will repeatedly extract (nested) subsequences from , which we will
always denote by the same symbol, .
 Now
 is bounded in  so by the Alaoglu theorem, there exists a
subsequence , to some weak limit . Since
 is a bounded linear map, it is continuous with
respect to the weak (and strong) topologies on . It follows that
. But 


 by uniqueness of weak limits. Hence 
.

Now the inclusion  is compact
by Rellich's lemma, so the bounded set  is compact
in . Hence, any sequence in , for example  itself, has
 a subsequence which is strongly convergent in . Once again,
denoting this
subsequence by , we have
. But then 

so
0=V_i,^_L^2 V ,^_L^2 .
Hence .

But  is continuous, so 
, and so 
by uniqueness of weak limits. So  and 
, and hence , so .
Then, by () and (),
1&=& V_i_H^1 ^2=V_i_L^2 ^2+__E_ ^V_i_L^2 ^2

&=&2_(V_i,V_i)+V_i_L^2 ^2+_2R^N(dE_, V_i)dE_,V_i_L^2 

&&2_(V_i,V_i)+V_i_L^2 ^2+C_V_i_L^2 ^2
where  is a constant,
by compactness of  and the tensorial property of . Taking limits
of both sides of ()
 and using  and 
, one sees that , a contradiction.



We remark that the  version of this result, that there exists a constant
 such that  for
all , is much easier to prove. Since 
is elliptic, self adjoint and positive definite (for weakly stable ),
and  is compact, we know immediately that the spectrum of 
is discrete and, normal to its kernel, bounded away from . The result
immediately follows. In fact the optimal constant  in
this case is just the lowest nonvanishing eigenvalue of . Hence
the optimal bound is attained in this case, by any eigensection with this
eigenvalue.
We remark also that the spectrum of  is
of independent physical interest since it gives the semiclassical
meson spectrum of the sigma model in the topological sector .

Continuity of  Let  be a sequence of smooth holomorphic maps between
compact
Kahler manifolds, converging
in  to a smooth holomorphic map . From Theorem
 we have for each  a positive constant 
and the positive constant , which give lower bounds for the
ratio  for any
 section of the pullback bundle  orthogonal to all Jacobi fields.
In this section we will establish
conditions sufficient to guarantee that 
. In subsequent sections
we will show that these conditions are met in the cases of interest to us.

In order to compare various quantities (especially the Hessian and 
norm)
 at different maps, it is convenient to make
various identifications so that we can treat all geometric quantities and
operators as being defined on the fixed bundle .
Since , for sufficiently large  each pullback bundle
 is topologically equivalent to
. However, since each bundle  comes naturally equipped with both an
inner product and a compatible connexion (both of which
occur in the Hessian and the -norm of a section) we would also like to
transfer these geometric structures to the bundle .

Again since , for each  (and for each sufficiently
large ) there is a unique minimizing geodesic joining 
to . By parallel transporting vectors along this unique geodesic we
construct a canonical isometry between the fibres of  and the fibres
of  at each point , and hence a natural  isometry between
 and . Using this isometry we can interpret the
natural connexion on each  as a connexion on , which we shall write
. Using the connexion  and the (fixed)  metric
on  we can now interpret each of the Jacobi operators 
(and
hence also the associated symmetric bilinear form ) as an
operator on sections of the fixed bundle .
Similarly, for each  we get an  norm on sections of , by
using the connection  and the fixed  metric.
Since the difference of any two connexions on  is tensorial, it is clear
that for each  (sufficiently large) the  norm is equivalent
to the  norm
on sections of .

Suppose now that the difference between the connexions  and
 tends to zero in the the following pointwise sense
V - _n V a_n V where each  is a positive number,  as , and
 refers to the natural pointwise norms on the bundles
 and , and  is a smooth section of .

 
Suppose that () holds, then the following inequalities also hold:

(i) 


(ii) 


(iii) 


where ,  are positive numbers which tend to zero as ,
and
 is the  norm on ,
 is the  norm on 
defined using the connection  and 

 is the  norm on 
defined using the connection .

Proof:  (i) Elementary manipulations involving the triangle
inequality, inequality () and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality
yield the following chain of inequalities
 _M (^2 - ^2)    &&
_M 
 ^2 -^2   

&& _M   -    .     +
      

&& _M   -    .  (   2 +

&& 2a_n  V  .   + a_n^2
V^2 

&& ( 2a_n + a_n^2)  V _1^2 . Hence the result follows with .

(ii) This is immediate from the definition of the  norm and part (i).

(iii) The definition of  (see equation ), together
with
the compactness of  and the fact that
 in  implies that
_n ^ -^_n  =0.
Using part (i) and the definition of  we have
 (V,V) - (V,V)  &=&  1 2 ^2 - 1 2 ^2
-^ V,V+ ^_n V,V


&& 1 2

&& b_n V ^2_1 + (^ -^_n )V
  V 

&& b_n V ^2_1 + ^ -^_n 
 V ^2. The result now follows from (). 


We will also need the following simple proposition on the continuity of
 orthogonal projection operators.


 
Let  denote the  sections of . Let  be a sequence of
finite
dimensional vector subspaces of  of constant dimension 
which converge to another -dimensional subspace  of ,
in the following sense: there exists an -orthonormal basis 

 of  and an -orthonormal basis  of  so
that for
each ,  in  as .
Denote by  and  the  orthogonal projections onto
 and  respectively. Then  in
the operator norm on , the bounded linear maps between
 and itself.

Proof: 
In this proof, norms and inner products without subscripts will refer to
 norms and inner products, while 
norms and inner products will be referred to with the subscript .
Since  and 

we have
P_n v - Pv _k &=& _iv,e_i^n e^n_i  -
_iv,e_i e_i  _k _iv,e_i^n e^n_i - v,e_i e_i  _k
  

&& _iv,e_i^n e^n_i - v,e_i^n e_i +
v,e_i^n e_i -v,e_i e_i _k  

&& _iv,e_i^n    e_i^n-e_i_k + e_i_k 
v,e_i^n-e_i   

&& v (_ie_i^n e_i^n-e_i_k + e_i_k
e_i^n-e_i ) 

&& v (_i(1+ e_i_k) e_i^n - e_i_k ).
So for all  we have,
(P_n-P)v_k v_k  (P_n-P)v_k v  (_i(1+ e_i_k) e_i^n - e_i_k ). Since by assumption  strongly in  for each ,
() implies that
_n _v0 (P_n-P)v_k v_k   =0
as required.



We now state the main result of this section, a theorem giving
sufficient conditions for  to depend continuously on the
holomorphic map . The analogous result in Stuart's analysis
of slowly moving abelian Higgs vortices is Lemma 3.2 of. Our
proof of Theorem is inspired by Stuart's argument.

 
Let  be a sequence of smooth holomorphic maps between
compact
Kahler manifolds converging in  to the
smooth holomorphic map . Suppose all the Jacobi fields of
 are integrable and that the conclusions of Lemma hold. Then


Proof: 
Let ,  denote  orthogonal projection onto
 and  respectively.
Since  is Jacobi integrable, the space of sufficiently -close
holomorphic maps is a  manifold of
dimension equal to . This also holds for all
 for all  sufficiently large.
In particular, the subspaces  satisfy the hypotheses of
the previous proposition for any , and in particular
for . Hence by the previous proposition we have 
for some positive numbers  tending to  as .


We will prove (i) 
and (ii) . From (i) and
(ii) it
follows that  exists and equals
.


Proof of (i): consider for any 
, the section 
.
Since 

we get
 V_n,V_n _H^1_   -  V-V_n_H^1_ (V_H^1_ +V_n_H^1_ )
d_n(d_n + 2) .Using the previous inequality and inequality (ii) of Lemma  we
have

&& b_n V_n,V_n _H^1_   +  d_n(d_n + 2) 

&& f_n where  is another sequence of
positive numbers tending to zero as .

Since  for some
, we have 
. Hence

=  (V,V)   - (V,V)    


&& (V,V)  -  +  (V,V) -
(V,V)    

&& f_n (V,V) + c_n    f_n 1-f_n 
(V,V)   + c_n 1-f_n . Let  be a
minimizing sequence for  with unit  norm, that is


Hence there exists a positive constant  and numbers  tending
to zero as , such that

() imply that

 we see that

Hence for any limit point  of the sequence
 we have . In particular
 we
have 
as required.


Proof of (ii): Since the proof of (ii) is very similar in
character to the proof of (i) we shall omit some details.
Consider the projection  of an element 
 into .
Several applications of the triangle inequality, together with the
inequalities
in Lemma  and the fact that  in , show that

Let

a minimizing sequence for  with unit  norm,
that is



Hence there exists a positive constant  and numbers 
tending

Consider the sequence

The two previous facts together with () imply that

Hence for any limit point  of the sequence
 we have . In particular
 as claimed.





The case of  
 It is interesting
to consider the simplest nontrivial case, namely 
, in
detail. Although  in this case, it is often helpful to distinguish
between domain and codomain by continuing to denote them 
respectively. We
shall do this when clarity requires.
The  action on  introduced in section
 extends naturally to , and leaves
 invariant. It follows that  is constant on
 orbits in . Since  acts with cohomogeneity 1 on
, it suffices to consider  for the one-parameter
family of maps _:zz,[1,) lying on the curve
 in  (so
 as in section ).
We may think of  as a
positive function  on .
We will first use the results of section  to prove that 
is continuous. Positivity and continuity of  ensure that it is bounded
away from zero on any compact set.
The domain of   (whether thought of
as a function on  or on )
is noncompact, however, so we cannot conclude
that  is globally bounded away from zero.
 The
essential question is, then, how does  behave as
, that is, as the lump collapses to zero width? We
will prove that .

First we address the issue of continuity. By symmetry,
it suffices to consider a
sequence of degree 1 holomorphic maps  in the curve ,
labelled by a sequence  in .
If  then the corresponding maps 
converge
in  to . Since
every holomorphic map  is Jacobi integrable, we may apply the
results of section . We merely need to prove that the pointwise
inequality () on the pullback connexions 
(
transfered
to )
 holds for any such
sequence . Then Lemma  applies, and continuity of
 follows from Theorem .

We must first construct the canonical isometry between each  bundle
 and the fixed bundle 
equipped with their  inner products. To this end, it is convenient
to define an orthonormal frame ,
 on , where  are the
usual polar coordinates, and the corresponding sections 

, , .
Note that varying  within the family  sends each fixed 
along a geodesic of constant  in . Note also that the frame 
is parallel along geodesics of constant , so the canonical isometry
between  and  is simply given by the
identification
ident 
E _1^nE _1,E _2^nE _2.
It is this property which makes polar coordinates particularly natural
for our purposes.


In this coordinate system, a holomorphic map  is
(,)(f_(),),f_()=2^-1 (
 2  ).
We will construct the pullback connexion
 by computing its action on 
, .
The Levi-Civita
connexion on  is
1x 
E_1 = e_2E_2,E_2 =- e_2E_1,
or equivalently,
e_1= e_2e_2,e_2 =- e_2e_1,
where  is the coframe dual to .
The following properties
of  are essential for computations:
 
[(a)] if ,  and
, then ;
[(b)]
 if  may locally be identified with a vector field
 on  (i.e. , on a neighbourhood of ), then
.
Now  and 
, where  denotes differentiation with respect to . Hence
&&
^ _E_1 E _1=
^ _E_1 E _2=0


^ _E_2 E _1&=&f_  
_E _2 E _1=f_  f_E _2=
f_   E _2

 ^ _E_2 E _2&=&f_  
_E _2 E _2=-f_  f_E _2=
-f_   E _2.
Note that when , , and ,
so () should reduce
to (), which it does.

Any section of  may be written
W=V+J^NU,V=(,)E _1,U=(,)E _1.
Note that  commutes with  by the Kahler property. By the
defining property (a),  above, and (), one sees that
5x 
^V=_ e_1E _1+1  _
e_2E _2+f_   e_2E _2,
where subscripts  denote partial derivatives.
This gives us explicit formulae for  and
. Using the identification () we may transfer
a section 
of  to , act with 
, then transfer back using the same identification, calling the result
. The difference between  and 
 is, by (),
6x 
( -_n)W=f_  -f__n   
(e_2E _2 -e_2E _1)
=f_  -f__n   J^NW.
An elementary calculation shows that
f_  
-f__n   &=&
( ^2-_n^2)2 2( ^2^2 2 +
^2 2 )(_n^2^2 2 +
^2 2 ) 

f_  
-f__n   &&1 2 (1+
1  ^2 +1 _n^2 +1  ^2_n^2 )
 ^2-_n^2.Hence, we have a pointwise bound of the form (),
( -_n)Wa_n W
where
a_n=1 2 (1+
1  ^2 +1 _n^2 +1  ^2_n^2 )
 ^2-_n^20
as , as required.





Having shown that  is continuous, we now address its behaviour
as . In particular, we will
 prove that .
To do this, it suffices to consider only sections of
 of
a certain type, which we will call
"irrotational," namely those of the form
V=()E _1.
It is straightforward to compute  for such sections,
and hence obtain
 as an explicit
integral functional of .  It follows from () that
^ V=-(f_  )
(e_1E _2+e_2E _1).
The Hessian for irrotational sections is
_ (V,V)=^ V_L^2 ^2=
2_0^d(f_  )^2.
We seek to compare this quantity, for irrotational
sections  orthogonal to , with .
Note that  is six-dimensional, and is spanned by
K_^m=-2^m(/2) 1+^2^2 (/2) [
(1-m) E _1+(1-m) E _2],m=-1,0,1
and their images under . This basis is obtained by considering
curves in  through  generated by altering the real part
 of one of the
coefficients of the rational map.
Every irrotational section  is automatically  orthogonal to
 and , so we need
only insist that  is  orthogonal to the one and only irrotational
section in the basis, , which we will henceforth denote .
Explicitly, we require that
V,K__L^2 =-2_0^d
() ^2 2 +
^2^2 2  =0,
having rearranged  slightly.

We shall also need an explict formula for .
Equation () implies that
^ V=e_1E _1+f_  
e_2E _2,
so
V_H^1 ^2&=&^ V_L^2 ^2+V_L^2 ^2=
2_0^d( (+^2f_ ^2 ^2+^2)

&=&_ (V,V)+V_L^2 ^2
+2_0^d 2f_

&=& _ (V,V)+V_L^2 ^2
+V,_V_L^2 where  is the energy density of the map .
To see the last equality, note that  is holomorphic, hence
conformal, so
4x 
f_E_1=dE_2=f_  .
Equation () follows from () and integration by parts.



It also proves useful to write down the formulae above using cylindrical
coordinates instead of spherical polar coordinates on the domain.
That is in place of  we use  where
. First notice, that with respect to these
cylindrical coordinates  arises by translating one fixed
profile by a  dependent amount. More precisely,
 f_ (s) = f_1(s+  )
where
f_1(s) = 2 ^-1 (s ) .
We have an analogous formula for  the irrotational part of the
kernel of 
K_ (s) = (s+  )  E _1.
It is a routine computation to obtain the following formulae for
,  and the
,  norms of an irrotational section  from the corresponding
formulae using spherical polars already presented
V,V _L^2  = _- ^  ds  ^2s   ^2
V,_V_L^2  = _- ^  ds ^2(s +
 )^2 V,V _H^1  = _- ^  ds
((d ds )^2 + ^2(s +  )   ^2  +
^2s   ^2 )
__  (V,V) = _- ^  ds (
d ds  + (s +  )    )^2.
We may now state and prove the main result of this section.
We shall denote the
map  by  to emphasize its parametric dependence.


  [global coercivity of the Hessian fails on ]


Proof:  Define the following sequence of smooth irrotational sections
 of 
where
_ (s) = s  - c_  K_ (s)
and  is a constant determined by the requirement that
.
By our previous remarks, this suffices to ensure that  is orthogonal
to 
Since  it suffices to prove that
_  __  (,) ,_H^1 ^2 =0. In fact, we will show that
_  __  (,) ,__L^2  =0, which implies () since




To prove (), first notice that since  we have

Using the explicit expression for the Hessian in cylindrical coordinates we
find


where . Since 
 holds for all ,


holds for all . Since  is bounded for
all , () is implied by
_ ,__L^2  = +.
To establish (), first introduce for each nonnegative pair of
integers  the positive function

Clearly, the function  is bounded above by the constant
.
From the definition of  we have


and from equation () and the definition of  we have



Since  is a positive constant and ,  are
positive and bounded above, ()  will follow
if we can establish that . In fact,
one can explicitly evaluate the
integrals which appear in the definition of  to obtain




Clearly, this implies that  as
required.





The case of  
Staying in the context of the  model on , but generalizing to
any degree sector, , things become rather more difficult. The
reason is that the isometric action of  on  does not have
cohomogeneity 1, except for . In general, then, to understand the
global behaviour of  one must consider the  dimensional
orbifold , not simply a curve, as in section .
Reduction to a curve
 is  possible, however, provided we restrict attention
to dynamics within a certain equivariance class.
Employing stereographic coordinates  on domain and codomain as usual,
and defining polar coordinates such that , one may write the
field equation for the  model on spacetime  as
W_tt  (1+r^2)^2 -(W_rr +1 r W_r+1 r^2 W_ 
)-2W  1+W^2 (W_t^2 (1+r^2)^2 -W_r^2-
1 r^2 W_^2)=0.
This supports equivariant solutions within the ansatz
an 
W(r,,t)=r^nq(r,t)e^in .
Provided  is nowhere vanishing
and has suitable boundary behaviour, solutions within this ansatz have degree
. Substituting () into () one obtains a
-dimensional
hyperbolic partial differential equation for . The space of static
solutions is simply , a complex constant. So the
equivariant moduli space is 
, the punctured
complex plane. Note that  is one connected component of
the fixed point set in  of
the isometry group 
, so we are assured
that  is totally geodesic. Both the true wave map
flow and its geodesic approximant stay within the equivariance
 class, therefore,
and one can again ask to what extent the analytic method of Stuart applies.
The equivariant configuration space enjoys a residual  symmetry,
namely , and the discrete symmetry 
,
both of which leave the harmonic map energy unchanged, so we may again
restrict attention to a curve in , namely
.
The situation is actually simpler  than in the full degree 1 case,
because
now the error, that is, the section of  along which we exponentiate
to get from the holomorphic approximant to the true solution at time ,
must
also lie within the equivariance class. The only sections of relevance,
therefore, are irrotational sections and their  images. We may
define a new optimal constant , again the infimium
of the Hessian for  unit sections  orthogonal to ,
but now
we include only equivariant sections. Since these form a subset of all
sections, we have trivially that  by
Theorem .

Once again, we may think of  as a function
of . We first show that  is continuous.
Since the setup is very similar to section  we
use equivalent notation and conventions, and omit several details.
In spherical polar coordinates, the map  is
(,)(f_(),n),
f_()=2^-1 (^n
 2  ),
so  and 
. It follows that
^E _1=nf_  e_2E_2 ,^E _2=-nf_  e_2E_1 .
Hence, on an irrotational section ,
^V=V'e_1E _1+Vnf_  
e_2E _2.
Given a general equivariant section , where  are irrotational,
we may transfer  to a neighbouring bundle  (where
) using the canonical isometry (),
act with , then transfer back again, to obtain
. The difference between this and  is

So the pullback connexion satisfies a pointwise bound of the correct type
( where  as
) and we may conclude from the results of section that  is continuous.

As for , the interesting issue is the large  behaviour of
. We are so far unable to prove anything rigorous about
 (if, indeed, it exists). However, we
make the following conjecture:

  For all , 
exists and is finite. For all , this limit is not zero.

If true, the equivariant Hessian is globally coercive for degree 
greater than
unity. One could at least hope, therefore, to model equivariant lump collapse
accurately within the geodesic approximation in the case .

To motivate this conjecture, we should describe some numerical work which led
directly to the proof of its  counterpart, Theorem . It is
straightforward to write the Jacobi operator on irrotational sections as an
explicit ordinary differential operator acting on . The
eigenvalue problem for  then reduces to a singular
Sturm-Liouville problem on , namely
-2 f_ ^2 Here  is the eigenvalue.
The eigenfunctions of this problem form an  orthogonal basis for the
space of irrotational sections. In particular, the eigenfunctions outside the
kernel, which we shall refer to as "excited states", in analogy with
quantum mechanics,
 form a basis for the irrotational sections orthogonal to
. If we could prove that 
 is bounded uniformly away from zero for
all 
and all excited states , global coercivity of  would follow.
Conversely, if for one of the excited states, 
 as , global coercivity must fail: the
one parameter family of excited states itself provides a counterexample.
Unfortunately, the ( families) of eigensections are rather inaccessible
analytically (except in the special case , where they are known
exactly). However, they are quite easy to construct numerically, either by
employing a specialist Sturm-Liouville solver package, or by using a
shooting method. We have tried both strategies, obtaining compatible
results from each.

Plots of the ratio  against
 for the first excited state  of the Sturm-Liouville problem
() with , . To facilitate
comparison of the curves, in each case the ratio has been normalized by its
value at  (, ,  and  respectively, to 2
decimal places). Note that only for  does the ratio tend to 0 as
.
 

The pertinent results may be summarized as follows.
For  and for all excited states from 2nd to 6th (ordered by
increasing ), the ratio  appears
to remain bounded away from zero as . More interesting is the
first excited state. Here the ratio remains bounded away from zero for
, but not for . It was by examining the
graphs of the 
first excited eigenstates that the explicit family  of the proof of
Theorem  was devised: the family is designed to have the same
qualitative behaviour as the numerically generated eigenstates.
In figure 1 we present a graph showing the ratio
 as a function of  for the first excited
states for .
These data were generated by a shooting method using a 4th order Runge-Kutta
scheme with variable 
step. The singularities at  were handled
by series expansions, so the scheme shot forwards from  and
backwards from , applying a matching condition at 
 ( being a small positive number, typically ).
The difference between  and the other cases is
quite clear. Although it is impossible to be exhaustive numerically, the
results suggest that  is bounded away from
zero for , as we have conjectured.
Linhart and Sadun in a recent numerical study
of lump collapse in the
 model on  imposed the analogous equivariance
condition on their field equation. It is an intriguing
coincidence that they found that single lump collapse differs greatly from
the predictions of the geodesic approximation (truncated to a finite disk in
), whereas the collapse of two coincident lumps is quite well modelled by
the geodesic flow.
