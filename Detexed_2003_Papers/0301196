dS(there are two 
infinity points, on different sheets of the hyperelliptic Riemann surface), 
which disappears when varying in . All this hints 
that one needs to extend the set of variables to 
include Whitham times, which are coefficients of the singularity of  and
are related to the coefficients of  and 
the leading coefficient of (There is 
also another possibility, that is, to blow up the singularity at infinity 
. Then, one needs to add additional handles and additional moduli 
. The extra differentials holomorphic on this higher genus surface
reduce upon degeneration to the meromorphic differentials ().
This procedure allows one to solve the problem of higher pole of 
, but one still is left with too many additional moduli of the curve that 
are not included into the set of variables.) .
Indeed, since we have a (two) puncture(s) at infinity, it is natural to choose the 
local parameter to be . Then, using formulas (), 
one realizes that the Whitham times parameterize the superpotential as 
follows(We drop the irrelevant constant term from the 
superpotential.) 
W()=_k=1 ^n+1 t_k^k
The leading coefficient here can be fixed unit.

One should also add to the set of parameters an extra time variable related 
to the leading coefficient  of the function t_0  res   (dS)=f_n-1 
2(n+1) ,    d_0dSt_0 
The corresponding formula for the prepotential looks like (see)
Ft_0 =_- ^ dS
Thus, one finally ends up with 
a generic hyperelliptic curve parameterized in a tricky way 
(). It usually depends on  branching points, but on  moduli 
parameters, since one can fix any three branching points using fractional-linear
transformations. However, our data requires fixing the local parameter 
 which means that one can no longer use the fractional-linear 
transformation, and the dimension of this extended moduli space of 
(decorated) Riemann surfaces is equal to .

This is the main advantage of our approach that it effectively treats as moduli 
all  the parameters emerging in the physical problem/auxiliary curve.
  
5. WDVV equations. 

Now we come to another property that is often celebrated by Whitham 
prepotentials, that is, to the Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde (WDVV) 
equations. In the most general form they were written in 
 as a system of algebraic relations
F_IF _J^-1 F_K = F_KF _J^-1 F_I,        I,J,K
for the third derivatives
F _I _JK =
^3FT_IT_JT_K  F_IJK 
of some function . Have been appeared first in the context of
topological string theories, they were rediscovered later
on in much larger class of physical theories (for a review see, e.g., 
an old survey and later papers).

Within the SUSY theories framework, the WDVV equations first appeared in 
, where the  SUSY prepotential of many physical 
theories was proved to satisfy the WDVV equations. Recently, it was 
realized that the  SUSY prepotential also satisfies 
the WDVV equations(There was realized in that 
some parts of the  SUSY prepotential in the case of
cubic superpotential also satisfy the WDVV equations in strange variables. 
The status of this observation is still unclear.) . The idea of proof of these 
equations is the same in both  and  SUSY cases
and is based on existence of an associative algebra of 
1-differentials. In fact, one also needs another crucial ingredient, the so 
called residue formula that expresses the third derivative of the 
prepotential via 1-differentials on the Riemann surface. This kind of 
formula was first suggested in in a quite abstract and general form 
and was later checked in concrete cases of  SUSY theories in 
. It was further checked in the  case in 
. This latter case is new as compared with the  case, 
since it includes the derivatives with respect to the Whitham times, while the 
residue formula in the  case dealt only with the 
-type variables.

More concretely, the residue formula in the  caseexpresses third derivatives of the prepotential via the residues at zeroes
of the differential , i.e. at branching points of the 
hyperelliptic curve ()
^3 FT_IT_JT_K  = 
dres  (dH_IdH_JdH_K
ddy) 
where the set of variables  includes  and the 
set of differentials  includes 
.

Now one should consider the algebra of 1-differentials  with a 
product  
algebra 
dH_I* dH_J=C^K_IJ dH^K
In order to define the structure constants  in this algebra,
one first needs to fix an arbitrary linear combination  of . Then, 
 are defined by the usual (not wedge!)
product of differentials modulo 
algebra1 
dH_IdH_J=C^N_IJ dH_NdH+ ydd 
where  means any 1-differential. Thus defined structure constants 
definitely depend on the choice of , see. Let us choose 
 with some . 

Using the definition (), one can either directly check that 
the algebra () is associative, or, using hyperelliptic 
parameterization, remove the factor  in order to reduce 
the algebra to the ring of polynomials with multiplication modulo the
polynomial ideal , which is obviously
associative.

In terms of structure constants, the associativity condition can be written 
as
ass 
C^K_IJ C^M_KN =C^K_IN C^M_KJ 
Now multiplying both sides of () by , taking residues at 
 and using the residue formula (), one obtains
FC 
F_IJK =C^N_IJ F_LNK 
One can easily check that the inverse matrix of  exists, and 
substituting () into (), one finally arrives at the WDVV 
equations ().

6. Concluding remarks. 

Note that the structures described here can be easily generalized to the case when
some of the cuts on the hyperelliptic case () shrink, i.e.,
y()=M_n-k ()_i=1 ^2k (_i) M_n-k ()g_2k () 
where  is a polynomial of degree  and
 is a polynomial of degree . This means that one is
effectively left with a new curve
ny 
y()=g_2k () 
This
curve of lower genus  along with the differential 
 give rise to a new prepotential that depends on
 moduli and  Whitham times. The details of this construction can be 
found in.
