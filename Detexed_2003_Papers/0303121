 We determine  partition functions
 of  super Yang-Mills gauge theory 
 for some  gauge groups on ,
 under the assumption that they are holomorphic.
 Our partition functions satisfy the gap condition
 and Montonen-Olive duality at the same time,
 like the  partition functions of Vafa and Witten.
 As a result we find a close relation between
 Hecke operator and -duality of 
  super Yang-Mills for  gauge group
 on .
Introduction 
 
This article provides a new result for our trial to determine the 
partition functions on .
The difficulty in this trial was due to
the compatibility between the Montonen-Olive duality
and the gap condition.
In this article, we define the deformed Hecke operator
(a kind of Hecke operator) as a new tool.
By using this operator, we overcome this difficulty
and determine the  partition functions
on  for some groups,
which satisfy the  Montonen-Olive duality
and the gap condition at the same time.

Vafa and Witten have first investigated the twisted 
exact partition functions for  on some Kahler 4-manifold,
such as .
The twisted  super Yang-Mills theory 
is a kind of topological field theoryand its partition functions are expected to have simple form.
In fact the partition function is 
the summation of the Euler number of the moduli space of ASD equations.
The moduli space which appears in the twisted  super Yang-Mills theory
is that of the irreducible connections.
The dimension of this moduli space is given by
the Atiyah-Hitchin-Singer formula.
This formula shows 
that the moduli space of small instanton number  vanishes.
Thus the corresponding partition functions have a gap.
This condition is called the gap condition.
On the other hand, the  twisted  super Yang-Mills theory
must obey -duality of  super Yang-Mills theory.
-duality of  super Yang-Mills theory is believed to be the one 
considered by Montonen and Olive.
In the Montonen-Olive duality,
the exchange of strong/weak coupling constant 
accompanies 
the exchange of the gauge groups .
When  is  gauge group,
 . 
Here  is center of 
 and  is the number of elements of .
The above general structure of the twisted 
partition functions are called Vafa-Witten conjecture.

After the Vafa-Witten conjecture was proposed,
the results satisfying this appeared in many examples.
What about the case of  gauge groups ?
Indeed, there was a conjecture for  gauge groups
supporting the Montonen-Olive duality conjecture.
However there has been no trial to determine
the  partition functions on .
This was our original motivation.
Our first trial succeeded to show the  Montonen-Olive duality,
but our  partition functions did not satisfy the gap condition.
Inwe first thought of the primary functions 
of complex coupling constant 
for  gauge groups, 
which were derived from the denominator identity.
Then we obtained a set of functions generated by the modular transformations
 of the primary functions .
Finally we prepared linear combinations of these functions 
with appropriate coefficients as the  partition functions,
and determined the coefficients of them
by requiring the Montonen-Olive duality.
The resulting  partition functions satisfied the Montonen-Olive duality,
but did not satisfy the gap condition.

One more difficulty of our previous proposalis the complexity of the determination of the partition functions.
In proceeding to determine the higher rank cases of 
 partition functions,
we find that these partition functions
are written by the deformed Hecke operator except for  and  cases. The deformed Hecke operator is defined as follows.
We think of the theory with 't Hooft flux .
For meromorphic modular form  with weight ,
the deformed Hecke operator is defined by
T_N^(v) ():=1 N^2 _
 
 
_dv,0 _d^-b(v a )^2  2  d(a+b d )
where  is mod  Kronecker delta
and .
Note that this form is the same form as the Hecke operator
of order  for modular form with weight  except for  and
.
To select the types of the block  mod ,
we introduce .
Here we point out that when  satisfies 
 mod ,
 has the form () 
and .
 To project out the type  mod ,
we introduce .
These two factors are sufficient and necessary
to classify the diffeomorphic equivalent types of  on .
() completely satisfies 
the full version of Montonen-Olive duality,
as we will verify later.
In the verification, we use the condition 
that  is meromorphic modular form with weight .
Each group has the corresponding  as follows.
In  case, choosing ,
.
 is 24th power of Dedekind eta function.
This result was already derived by Vafa and Witten.
In  case, 
we choose .
 is given by the reinterpretation of our previous resultsas follows.
 is derived from the primary functions . Concretely
 is given by summing up all possible modular transformations of .
By using  , we define  by,
Z_G ^v():=T__G  ^(v) _G ().
Note that  includes 
manifestly and satisfies the corresponding Montonen-Olive duality,
but does not satisfies the gap condition.

The deformed Hecke operator is a powerful tool
in the sense that we may only concentrate on 
the determination of ,
which is improved from  
in such a way that  satisfies the gap condition.
Before moving on the determination of ,
we will mention about the natural assumption 
that the total partition functions on 
are holomorphic for all  gauge groups.
This  assumption excludes the holomorphic anomaly or -dependence
 and ensures the justification of the form ().
The possibility of the holomorphic anomaly is not so unnatural 
in the twisted  super Yang-Mills theory,
since the holomorphic anomaly comes from the failure of the reduction 
 
by the mass perturbation proportional to the section of the canonical bundle.
Typically on , the holomorphic anomaly appears,
since  has the locus where the section of the canonical
bundle vanishes.
On the other hand, since  has trivial canonical bundle,
we assume that the partition function on  has no holomorphic anomaly.
Now we will derive 
by improving .
In fact the form of 
is given by the polynomial of  over ,
on the condition that 
has the only singularity at  on the upper half plane ().
Here  is modular function.
Since the Hecke operation preserves this property,
the singularity property of 
is transferred  into that of , which is necessary for  partition functions.
By requiring this form for ,
 we can determine 
in such a way that 
satisfy the gap condition.
The resulting partition functions satisfy
the Montonen-Olive duality and the gap condition at the same time.
We expect that for all  groups 
the above processes are valid,
but we can only derive the partition functions 
satisfying these two conditions for some groups.
Therefore we have to discuss the condition of the gapful partition functions.
In determining 
which reproduces the gapful partition functions,
we observe that the gapful partition function can exist only
when the rank of  satisfy the following property:
T_rank(G )+1 =T__G  ().
Here  is the true Hecke operator.
 is some polynomial of 's which cannot be written by .
One can find 
this property of the Hecke operator in
the product of the Hecke operators.
This observation is explained as follows.
  is always gapful
partition function, as we will show later.
In fact this gapful partition function can be obtained from  in the same way as the above processes.
However these processes are not always valid 
and this partition function can be obtained from  only for the cases of ().
This situation is the same as that of .
Thus we can investigate the condition of the gapful partition functions
by using the property of the Hecke operator.

The organization of this article is the following:
In Sec.2 we review the Vafa-Witten theory and the Vafa-Witten conjecture
for the twisted  super Yang-Mills theory.
Next we define the deformed Hecke operator,
which satisfies the Montonen-Olive duality completely.
We reinterpret the  partition functions on 
by using this deformed Hecke operator.
In Sec.3 we give the universal processes of 
deriving 
our previous  partition functions, by using the deformed Hecke operator.
In Sec.4 we improve the results in Sec.3 under the assumption that the total partition functions are holomorphic.
In Sec.5 we first introduce the gapful partition function and the product
of the Hecke operators.
By using them, we discuss the condition of the gapful partition functions.
In Sec.6. we conclude and discuss the remaining problems.

Review of Vafa-Witten Theory and  partition Functions on  
Vafa and Witten have first intended to test -duality conjecture of  super Yang-Mills 
theory, by determining the exact partition functions.
It is well-known that  super Yang-Mills theory on -manifold
is exactly finite and conformally invariant.
However it is still hard to determine the exact  partition function itself.
Thus they thought of the twisted  super Yang-Mills theory,
which is topological field theory and whose
partition function can be determined exactly.
In this context, they 
investigated the mathematical results of 
the  partition functions on simple 
Kahler 4-manifolds such as (blow-uped  and .
On the other hand, 
-duality conjecture of (twisted) super Yang-Mills theory is believed to be the one considered by Montonen and Olive.
This -duality accompanies the exchange of gauge groups .
 is the dual of .
If   is  gauge group,  is given by . 
Here

To classify the theory for ,
we introduce 't Hooft fluxes .
We point out that  with  is regarded as  itself.

 
 
 
 
Vafa-Witten Conjecture 

In this subsection we denote the celebrated Vafa-Witten conjecture
concerned with partition function of twisted  super Yang-Mills theory
on 4-manifold .
Vafa and Witten pointed out that
the partition function of twisted  super Yang-Mills theory
can have remarkable simple form,
if  is a Kahler 4-manifold and vanishing theorem holds.  
In this situation, its partition function has the form of 
the summation of the Euler number of the moduli space of the ASD equations.
More precisely,  for twisted  theory
with 't Hooft flux  on ,
the partition function of this theory is given by the formula, 
 
where  is the moduli space of ASD connections 
associated to -principal bundle with 't Hooft flux  and fractional instanton number .
In (),  is the gauge coupling constant including theta angle,
 is Euler number of  and  is the rank of .
 The factor  is required to introduce by modular property like 
the case of  function.
On ,  and the partition function has top -term .

With this result, Vafa and Witten
conjectured the behavior of the partition functions under the action of  on . They started with 't Hooft's work in mind. 
In, the path integral with -valued electric flux and 
that with magnetic flux 
are related by Fourier transform.
Vafa and Witten combined the conjecture of strong/weak duality with this
't Hooft's result. Their conjecture is summarized by the following formula:  

 
where .

Hereafter we will concentrate on  case.
We discuss the gap condition on .
In  case
 is  the moduli space of irreducible 
ASD connections associated to -principal bundle with instanton number .
Its dimension  is given by
Atiyah-Hitchin-Singer dimension formula:
 M ^G _k=4h(G )(k-r)-4r,

where  is the dual Coxeter number,  is the dimension
of  and  is the instanton number. 
 means .
That is, the moduli space of irreducible ASD connections with 
 gauge group  on  exist only for  except for  trivial case.
This condition restricts the form of the partition function. 
That is, the  partition function cannot have  terms for .
This condition is called gap condition.





Deformed Hecke Operator and  Partition Functions on  

In this subsection, we define the deformed Hecke Operator, 
which reproduces Montonen-Olive duality for   partition functions on .
In, Vafa and Witten classified the types of 
 
theory with 't Hooft flux  on . 
There are three types:
 mod 4 and  (even), mod 4 (odd) and (trivial).
Here it is convenient to introduce the intersection matrix on  
by  instead of .
Here 
H=( ).
This replacement is sufficient to think of the partition functions 
with .
The generalization to   theory with  is straightforward,
but there is a complicated structure for general . 
To explain this structure, we introduce the block and the type.
For general  with divisors (),
the block  is defined by
B_d_i :=v d_iv=0  and    ^d_jv0  mod   N, d_id_j 
 and   d_id_j  .
For , we can introduce . 
The block  has  types:
[v_j]:=v (v/a_i)^2 =v ^2=_K3 v v =2j  mod   2d_i .
We call these types and these structure as orbits and orbit structures
respectively.
The numbers of the orbit are counted concretely in.
For the theory with , we define the deformed Hecke operator by
T_N^(v) ():=1 N^2 _
 
 
_dv,0 _d^-b(v a )^2  2  d(a+b d ),
where  is mod  Kronecker delta
and .
 is meromorphic modular form with weight .
 reduces to , which has the same form as 
the Hecke operator of order  for modular weight . 
We introduce  and  factors,
in such a way that this operator can represent the  partition function of 
all blocks and types.
 selects the block  mod ,
and  projects the type  mod .
For this definition, we are inspired by the results in.

The deformed Hecke operator has the following modular property:
T_N^(v) (-1  )=N^-11 ^-12 _u_N^uv 
T_N^(u) ( ).
This is nothing but the Montonen-Olive duality ().
Now we will verify ().
L.H.S. of () is given by
T_N^(v) ( -1  )
=N^-11 ^-12 
1 N^2 _
 
 
_dv,0 _d^-b(v a )^2  2  
(N p  )^12 a^11 
(p+ab^ ad  ),
where

.
If , then  and .
To derive R.H.S. of (), we give the equivalent form to (),
T_N^(v) ():=1 N^2 _
 
 
_ad v,0 _ad  ^-ab^(v p )^2  2  ad (p+ab^ ad  ).
By using this, R.H.S. of () is given by
_u _N^uv T_N^(u) ()
&=&_u _N^uv 
1 N^2 _
 
 
_ad u,0 _ad  ^-ab^(u p )^2  2  ad (p+ab^ ad  )


&=&
1 N^2 _
 
 
_ad v,0 _ad  ^-ab (v p )^2  2  
(a^2d )^11 ad (p+ab^ ad  ).
To obtain the last equality, we use the identity,
_u _N^uv _ad u,0 _ad  ^-ab^ 2 (u p )^2 
=_ad v,0 _ad  ^-ab  2 (v p )^2 (a^2d )^11 .
This identity is verified in Appendix A.
() and () show the equivalence between () and ().
We point out that the modular property () is similar to that of level  affine Lie algebra. For , we have already pointed out that the  partition functions are related to the level  affine  algebra in. 

By using the deformed Hecke operator,
we can define the  partition functions with  on  as follows.
We request () for the  partition functions
written by the deformed Hecke operator.
() means that the  partition function has top -term . Since ,we can conclude .
Thus we can obtain the  partition functions with :
Z_A_N-1  ^v()=T^(v) _N1 () .
We have to check the gap condition for  partition functions with .
As we will show in Sec.5,  has a gap.
For  case, we can obtain  partition functions,
which satisfy the Montonen-Olive duality and the gap condition at the same time,
when we only request the condition of top -term for the partition function written by the deformed Hecke operator. 

 Partition Functions on  without Gap 
In this section, we rederive the previous results 
by using the deformed Hecke operator.
For this purpose, we first introduce the primary function 
 for  gauge groups.
Next we reproduce the previous results by using these primary functions.

Denominator Identity and Stringy Picture of  Theory on  
In this subsection, we introduce the primary functions 
for  gauge groups, which are necessary 
not only for the previous derivationsbut also for the present derivations.
We will use the primary functions as a piece of 
 partition functions on .
We begin with the following stringy picture.

   

First line is IIA/Hetero duality. In second line of IIA side, we compactify
 and obtain  on .
 gauge group is determined by the type of the  space,
which is classified by the  sub-group of .
In second line of Hetero side, we compactify 
and obtain  on .
The origin of  is explained by 
the compactification of 
in IIA side.
Thus each side of 
the second line is equivalent and their partition functions 
in both side are the same.
On the other hand, the partition function of  theory on 
was already obtained by Nakajima.
In, we introduced the  blow-up formula ,
which is very similar to Nakajima's results.
This blow-up formula was derived from the generalization of our previous
results for .



Explicit  is given as follows:

 
 
 

We remark that all  are eta-product.
This fact comes from the definition of .
In, we defined 
by using the affine Lie algebra.
By combining the relations of stringy picture with ,
we define the primary functions for  gauge groups on : 
G_0^G ():=( ^2_G () ^r+1 () )^24 .
For  theory, this form is consistent with the fact that the moduli space of rank  semi-stable sheaves is described by Hilbert scheme of .

 Partition Functions on  without Gap 
We will first sketch the processes of the determinations 
of the partition functions in our previous work.
In, we introduced a set of functions generated
by the modular transformations of 
(in some cases we also included functions generated
by the modular transformations ).
We defined the  partition functions 
by the linear combinations of these functions with appropriate coefficients.
Finally we determined the coefficients in the partition functions,
so that these partition functions satisfy the corresponding Montonen-Olive
duality ().
 
In deriving the higher rank cases of ,
we observe that the  partition functions are also described 
by the deformed Hecke operator for some groups.
In  case,  partition  functions
 can be described by the deformed Hecke operator, 
 while  partition functions cannot.
Since the Montonen-Olive duality for  is complicated,
we do not treat these cases in this article.

We find the general processes to define the  partition functions.
They are equivalent to the previous processes,
but more general than before.
In  case, from the primary functions
we define  by   
 ^D_2N+1  ():=G_0^D_2N+1  (4).
 in () comes from . 
Then we define the meromorphic modular forms 
with weight  by
_D_2N+1  ():=1 2 _all possible modular transformation   
^D_2N+1  (),
where we sum up  all possible modular transformations
of  with  factors etc. neglected.
Overall factor  is introduced to compare the partition functions
with those in Sec.5.
By using , we define the  partition functions with
 by
Z_D_2N+1  ^v ():=T_4 ^(v)  _D_2N+1  ().
Here we remark that  contains  automatically. We give some examples as follows,
_D_3 ()=1  ,
_D_5 ()=24  ,
_D_7 ()=1  (j+6),
_D_9 ()=1  (24j-9984),
_D_11  ()=1  (j^2-1188j+9),
_D_13  ()=1  (24j^2-33088j+2304192),
_D_15  ()=1  (j^3-1932j^2+641682j+12),
_D_17  ()=1  (24j^3-50944j^2+21879936j-531714048),
_D_19  ()=1  (j^4-2676j^3+1882206j^2-266891000j+18),
_D_21  ()=1  (24j^4-68800j^3+55057056j^2-10821624576j+122700718368).
Here .

 partition functions satisfy the Montonen-Olive duality 
() by construction.
What about other conditions (),() ?
 partition functions  do not satisfy
the condition ().
We will improve this point in the next section.
 partition functions satisfy the condition (),
while  partition functions do not satisfy this.
In , the partition functions of the previous processes,
which are derived from  directly,
contains  terms formally.
However these terms are mutually cancelled.
Thus   partition functions 
starts from  instead of .
This is explained as follows.
Since all  partition functions
are described by the deformed Hecke operator ,
top -term must have the form ,
which is invariant under the translation .
As a result
we find that there are two classes  and 
in .

 Partition functions on  without Gap 
The processes of  cases are the same as those of .
 A)   

By replacing  in () by , of  is given by 
^E_7 ():=G_0^E_7 (2).
By using this, we obtain
_E_7 ():=1 2 _all possible modular transformation   
^E_7 ().
Finally we can define the  partition functions with  by 
Z_E_7 ^v():=T_2 ^(v)  _E_7 (),
_E_7 ()=1  (j^3-4465 2 j^2+1070688j-36935982).

 and  both satisfy the conditions () and (),
but do not satisfy the gap condition ().

We will give a comment on  case.
Formally  case can be treated in the same way as  and .
However  starts from  
and  starts from ,which
fails to satisfy the condition ().
Thus we do not consider  case in this article.

 Partition Functions on  with Gap 
In the previous section, we derived the  partition functions
described by the deformed Hecke operator,
Z_G  ^v():=T__G  ^(v)  _G ().
However they do not satisfy the gap condition. We want to improve these functions in such a way that they satisfy the gap condition.
Concretely we want to subtract some functions from these functions,
in such a way that the total partition functions satisfy the gap condition and
the Montonen-Olive duality at the same time.
What kind of functions can we subtract ?
We assume that the total functions are holomorphic.
Thus the functions to be subtracted also must be holomorphic.
If the partition function is not holomorphic,
we would not determine it only with the deformed Hecke operator.
When the twisted  partition function has holomorphic anomaly,
it has -dependence and is not holomorphic.
The twisted  partition function on Kahler 4-manifold
can be reduced to the twisted  partition function,
which is easier to determine.
This reduction is done by the holomorphic deformation
using the mass perturbation proportional to the section of the canonical bundle.
However there are cases when this section vanishes.
In these cases, one has to consider the contribution from the holomorphic anomaly.   
 or  are these cases.
On the other hand, there is no locus where the section of the canonical bundle vanishes, since  has the trivial canonical bundle.
Thus the partition function on  has no holomorphic anomaly and is holomorphic.
Once we assume that the functions to be subtracted are holomorphic,
it is easy to assume that the form of the functions to be subtracted
satisfies the Montonen-Olive duality.
The deformed Hecke operator makes meromorphic modular forms with weight 
satisfy the Montonen-Olive duality automatically.
We only have to determine  
which satisfies two conditions, by subtracting some meromorphic modular forms with weight .
To determine  , we restrict the form of it 
by requiring the singularity property of the partition functions as follows.
 has the only singularity at  on upper half-plane().
This property is kept under the operation of the deformed Hecke operators.
That is,  also has the singularity 
at  on upper half-plane and does not have the other singularities.
We also request the same property for 
even after the subtraction.
 on upper half-plane() is corresponding to the weak coupling limit 
after we deform the twisted  Yang-Mills theory to  or 
theory by the appropriate mass perturbation.
It is well-known that  or 
theory is asymptotic free.
We optimistically assume that the reduction  would not produce the other singularities except for .
If the meromorphic modular form with weight  has the only singularity at 
on upper half-plane,
the form of it is only the polynomial of  over .
Note that negative  powers can produce the other singularities.
Finally we define the gapful partition functions from the original one by
Z_G  ^v ():=T__G  ^(v) ^_G (),
^_G ()&:=&_G ()+1  _k=0 ^[r+1 _G  ]-2 a_k^j^k


&=&1  _k=0 ^[r+1 _G  ]-1 a_kj^k
where we determine  
in such a way that the partition functions satisfy the gap condition. 

Seeing the form (),
one would wonder the role of  in  .
That is,  would not be necessary to determine  which reproduces the gapful partition functions.
Indeed one can determine  directly from
the polynomial of  over .
However we believe that  and  must have the different roles in ,
since  itself is interpreted with stringy picture in Sec.3. Interpretation of 
is the remaining problem.

 Partition Functions on  with Gap  
Following the above processes, we define the  partition functions
with gap,
Z_D_2N+1  ^v ():=T_4 ^(v) ^_D_2N+1  (),
where  are determined so that  have gap.

we can only make a part of  partition functions gapful.
We also note that .  and

Product of Hecke Operator and Condition to Gapful Partition Functions 
In the previous section, we derived the  partition functions with gap.
However in some  cases we could not make the  partition functions gapful.
In this section, we discuss the condition of the gapful partition functions
by using the properties of Hecke operators.
In this section, we only think of  in , 
since we have already seen .

To discuss the condition of the gapful partition functions,
we introduce the following partition functions
by replacing  by 
and  by  in (),
Z _G  ():=T__G   _G (),
 _G ()&:=&_G ()+1  _k=0 ^[r+1 _G  ]-2 a _k j^k


&=&1  _k=0 ^[r+1 _G  ]-1 b_kj^k,
where  is also determined
in such a way that  are gapful.
 is the true Hecke operator defined by,
T_N():=1 N^13  _
 
 
d^12 (a+b d ).
 and  are only different in the power of 
except for overall factor.
Starting from the same ,
whether  
or  can be made gapful or not,
only depends on   in our calculations.
So, to discuss the condition of the gapful partition functions,
we use  instead of  itself.
When can we obtain   ?
We discuss this point by using the product of Hecke operators.
Before moving on  cases, 
we briefly show why  partition functions are always gapful.
That is, we show that we can always define . 
For this purpose, we give an important observation,
Z _G  ()=T_(rank(G )+1) 1 () .
When ,
this observation shows that  since .
This implies that we need not subtract functions from the original one.
R.H.S. includes the summation
_b=0 ^d-1 1 (a+b d ) 
&=&q^-a d  (1+_d^-1 +_d^-2 ++ _d^-(d-1) )+O (q^0)+,


&=&

 
. .
Thus  can always be defined. The observation ()
is also valid for  cases.
But  is not 
when  ().
To identify () with (), we search the cases when
 has the factor .
For this purpose, we cite the following theorem,
 
(Hecke)

For  with modular weight ,
the Hecke operators satisfy
 
[(a)] For a primitive  with ,
T_p^r T_p ()=T_p^r+1  ()+p^-13 T_p^r-1  ().
Hence  is a polynomial in  with integer coefficients.
[(b)]
T_m T_n ()=T_mn ()
if  and  are relatively prime.
[(c)] The algebra generated by the  for 
is generated by the  with  prime and is commutative.

Hereafter we list up the cases when  has the factor  for  and  cases.
a)    

By using the theorem we find
T_2^2+3M (2N^+1) 1  = T_4(polynomial of  T_2)T_2N^+1 1  .
L.H.S. is () and R.H.S. is ().
Thus we can read 
 _D_2^2+3M (2N^+1)-1  ()=(polynomial of  T_2)T_2N^+1 1  .
This shows that  cases are gapful cases.
Indeed several examples were listed up in Sec.4.1.
b)    

By using the theorem we find
T_81  =T_2(T_4-2^-13 T_1)1  .
Thus we can read
 _E_7 ()=(T_4-2^-13 T_1)1  .
 is also gapful case.
c)   
 We find
T_91 () = _E_8 ()=Z _E_8 ().
Furthermore the deformed Hecke operator is not necessary for  and we find
Z_E_8 ^()=Z _E_8 ()=T_91  .
This has already been seen in Sec.4.2.

As we have seen in the above discussion,
the condition to obtain the gapful partition functions
depends whether  has the factor  or not. When   does not have ,
we could not succeed in determining the gapful partition functions in our formalism.

Conclusion and Discussion 
We determined the twisted  partition functions
by using the deformed Hecke operator for some groups.
The resulting partition functions satisfy 
the Montonen-Olive duality and the gap condition at the same time.
All these partition functions were written by
the deformed Hecke operators.
We also discussed the condition of the gapful partition functions
by using the product of the Hecke operators.
We could obtain the gapful partition functions,
when  has the factor 
as a property of the Hecke operator.

The first remaining problem is to determine
the  partition functions not satisfying the condition of the Hecke operators.
There are two cases to consider.
One is the case of .
The partition function of this can be written by the deformed Hecke operator, but cannot be deformed into the gapful partition function.
The other is the case of  and .
The partition function of this cannot be written by the deformed Hecke operator.
In either case, we assume that the total partition functions
may not be written only by the deformed Hecke operators.
We also have to consider the possibility that the partition functions cannot be gapful.

The second remaining problem is the interpretation of .
This term must have the physical meaning like .

We also assume that the  blow-up formula can be written by the level  affine Lie algebra.
In our previous results for , this point was pointed out and we presume that this conjecture can be generalized to  cases.

Recently Dijkgraaf and Vafa proposed the methods of computing the 
 superpotential as a function of the glueball chiral superfield, such as in.
 They argued that this function includes the non-perturbative effects
 such as the Montonen-Olive duality.
 Our results may check their methods in the context of the Montonen-Olive duality.
