In this paper we study strings with quantized masses in the pp-wave
backgrounds. We obtain these strings from the membrane theory. For
achieving to this, one of the membrane and one of the spacetime directions
will be identified and wrapped. From the action of strings in the
quantized pp-wave backgrounds, we obtain its
mass dual action. Some properties of the closed and open strings in these
backgrounds will be studied.

Introduction 

It has been known that strings in the pp-wave NS backgrounds are exactly
solvable. The same is true for pp-waves on the Ramond-Ramond 
backgrounds. Solvability in this context means that it is possible to
find explicitly the solutions of the classical string equations,
perform a canonical quantization and determine the Hamiltonian operator.
It was recently pointed out that
the plane wave metric supported by an  5-form background& & ds^2 = 2dX^+dX^- -^2^8_I=1 X^I X^I(dX^+)^2 + ^8_I=1 
 dX^I dX^I,


& & F_+1234  = F_+5678  = 2,
provides examples of exactly solvable string models. That is,
the string action becomes quadratic in the light-cone gauge
.

Some properties of strings propagating
in such plane-wave backgrounds have been previously investigated, in
particular in the Refs..
This background is related, by a special limit, to the
 background. The solvability of string theory in
this background has some common features with string theory on
. Another important application of string theory
in this background is that, it tests AdS/CFT correspondence beyond the
supergravity approximation.

In the other side we have the
membrane theory. It is characterized by the 11-dimensional spacetime
. For more review also see the Refs.. In fact,
the membrane theory, by compactification and double dimensional
reduction, provides an enlarged framework for the study of strings.

Let one of the spatial directions of the membrane and of the spacetime be
identified and compactified on a circle.
In this case, the membrane can be viewed as infinite number of
strings in the pp-wave backgrounds with both positive and negative
quantized masses. This implies that the canonical quantization of
the membrane theory imposes the canonical quantization on the 
strings in the pp-wave backgrounds.
Therefore, the radius of the compactification will be fixed.

The action of these strings (i.e., ) describes interactions between the
worldsheets fields with opposite masses. By a transformation on the action
, we obtain another useful action (i.e., ), which contains
interactions between the worldsheets fields with the same masses.
Under some transformations on the
worldsheets fields, these actions are invariant or transform to each other.

We shall obtain the algebras and the Hamiltonians of the closed and open
strings. These Hamiltonians are normal ordered with respect to one of the
two indices that appear in each oscillator.

Note that we shall consider only the bosonic membrane. Therefore, we obtain
only bosonic strings. Generalization to the supersymmetric case is
straightforward. It is sufficient to consider supermembrane instead of
the bosonic membrane.
Since our formulation comes from the membrane theory, we shall
consider the eleven dimensional spacetime.

This paper is organized as the follows.
In section 2, we obtain the action of strings in the pp-wave backgrounds,
its quantization and its corresponding Hamiltonian from the
compactified membrane theory. In section 3, we
study the mass-dual theory and the symmetries of the actions  and .
In section 4, we study the massive closed strings.
In section 5, the massive open strings will be analyzed.

Strings from membrane 

It is possible to choose a
gauge that identifies the eleventh dimension of the spacetime with the
third dimension of the membrane worldvolume. 
This gauge is , where  and
 are coordinates of the membrane worldvolume.
This gauge also removes the cosmological constant
from the membrane action. By the procedure of the Ref., the light-cone
coordinates  can also put away
from the action. Therefore, the membrane action becomes
S=-T_2 2 d^2 d ^AB _AZ^I
_BZ^I,
where . The metric of the membrane worldvolume is
 and  is the membrane tension.
The equation of motion of the membrane extracted from this action is

(-_^2 + _^2+_^2 )Z^I(, ,
)=0.
If the -direction of the membrane is wrapped around a circle
with the radius , then
the -direction also is compact on the same circle. 
In fact, this is double dimensional
compactification, which compactifies both the spacetime and
the worldvolume on the same circle.
Upon dimensional reduction by shrinking the circle, the -direction
of the spacetime and the wrapped spatial dimension of the membrane will be
shrunk, for producing strings in ten dimension.

Now consider the set of functions

 (in R )  , nZ ,
where the range of  is .
This set of functions forms a complete set. Therefore, we can expand
, in terms of them, i.e.,

Z^I(,,)=^_n=-  X^I_n(,) q_n(),
where .
Therefore, the membrane may be viewed as a "tower of strings" with the
coordinates . As expected by
compactification, the coordinate 
with respect to  is periodic, i.e, 
. Since the membrane coordinate
 is real, we should have
& & a^_n = a_-n ,


& & X^I _n(, )= X^I_-n (,).
The membrane action (2) gives the
momentum conjugate to the coordinate  as
^I(,,)=T_2_n Z q_n()_X^I_n(,).
Quantization of the degrees of freedom is achieved by imposing the equal
time canonical commutation relation
[ Z^I(,,) , ^J(,) ]  
=i ^IJ (In other words, it is
T_2 _n Z _n' Z  q_n()q_n' (
[ X^I_n(,),_X^J_n' (,] 
=i ^IJ  (The delta functions in the right hand side imply that,
[ X_n^I(,) , _X_n' ^J(,] 
=2i ^IJ  (_n+n' , 0 .
The factor  is introduced for later purposes. We shall see
that, this equation gives the quantization of the strings coordinates
. Therefore, the equation (9) reduces to
_n Z  q_n() q_-n (=  1 2T_2 
(Now consider the orthogonality equation
_0^2R  d q_n()q_n' ()
= 2R a_n a_-n _n+n',0 .
According to this integral, the completeness of the functions
 gives
1 2R  _n Z 1 a_n a_-n   q_n() q_-n (=
(Without lose of generality, we assume that  for all values of
the integer . In this case, the equations (11) and (13) give the relation
R = 1 4^2 T_2 .
Therefore, 
the radius of compactification is fixed. That is, for the fixed parameters
 and , we can not decompactify or shrink the -direction,
to a circle with larger or smaller radius than .

Finally, the action becomes
S=-1 4nZ  d^2 (  ^ab 
_a X^I_n _b X^I_-n  + ^2_n X^I_n X^I_-n ) ,
where the worldsheets metric is  and
_n=n R  =n(4 ^2 T_2).
This implies that  is the momentum conjugate to the
compact coordinate , and  is momentum number.
The action (15) describes infinite number of strings that interact
with each other. Strings with positive and negative masses, where the absolute
values of these masses are equal,  couple to
each other. There is no coupling between the worldsheets fields with the same
masses. Since the quantity 
is quantum of the strings masses, one
interpretation is that, the membrane is a collection of infinite number
of strings in the quantized pp-wave backgrounds.

The equation of motion of a string with mass number , extracted from
this action is
(-^2_+ ^2_-^2_n)X^I_n (,)=0.
This equation also can be obtained from the equation (5) and the membrane
equation of motion (3).

The integral (12) and the equation (5) give the strings coordinates in terms
of the membrane coordinates
X^I_n (, ) = 2T_2 _0^2R  d q_-n  () Z^I(, , ).
Therefore, by an appropriate solution of the membrane, we can obtain 
solutions of the massive strings. But we shall obtain 
from the massive string equation (17).


The Hamiltonian 

The action (15) gives the momentum conjugate to the worldsheet field
 as
^I_n(, ) = 1 2 _X^I_-n 
(, ).
This implies that, strings with opposite mass numbers have conjugation
with each other. According to this conjugate momentum, the corresponding
Hamiltonian to the action (15) is
H= 1 4_nZ ^2d (  _X^I_n_X^I_-n  + _X^I_n
_X^I_-n  + ^2_n X^I_n X^I_-n  ) .
If we write , the condition (6) implies that each
 (i.e., the Hamiltonian of the string with mass number ) is Hermitian.
This Hamiltonian also can be obtained from the membrane Hamiltonian.

According to the equation (10) we have the following canonical quantization
for the degrees of freedom of the action (15)
[ X_n^I(,) ,  ^J_n' (,] 
=i ^IJ  (_nn' .
This quantization will be used for obtaining the algebra of the string modes.

The Hamiltonian (20) and the action (15) under the transformation
, are invariant. In the next section we shall
study a general symmetry transformation of this Hamiltonian and the
action (15).

Mass duality 

Under some transformations the action (15) remains invariant.
Furthermore, there are some other transformations that change this action to
another useful action. Consider the transformation
X^I_n Y^I_n = A^I_(n)J X^J_n + B^I_(n)J X^J_-n ,
where  and  are  matrices.
Now change  and compare the result with the conjugation
of the above transformation (i.e., perform dagger on it), we obtain
& & A^_n = A_-n ,


& & B^_n = B_-n .
These also give . Note that this kind of
conjugation only acts
on the index , therefore, spacetime indices under it are neutral. 

We now consider two cases. One case is that the action (15) and the
corresponding Hamiltonian (20) remain invariant and the other case is
that they transform to another useful action and Hamiltonian.

The invariance case 

For this case the matrices  and  satisfy the equations
& & A^T_n A_-n  + B^T_-n  B_n = 1 ,


& & A^T_n B_-n  + B^T_-n  A_n = 0 ,
where  is any integer number. 
According to these equations, these matrices also satisfy
the following equations
& & A_n A^T_-n  + B_n B^T_-n  = 1 ,


& & A_n B^T_n + B_n A^T_n = 0 .
Note that these equations are not independent of the equations (24).

Define the matrix  as
M  _n= (   ).                              
Therefore, the equations (24) and (25) can be written as in the following
M  ^T_n M  _-n  = M  _n M  ^T_-n  = 1 .
These are invariance conditions of the
action (15) and the Hamiltonian (20). For the zero mass case,
 is an orthogonal matrix. 

The mass-dual action 

Let the matrix  satisfy the equations
M  ^T_n M  _-n  = M  _n M  ^T_n = J ,
where the matrix  has the definition
J = (   ).                              
In this case, the action (15) and the Hamiltonian (20) transform to
the action
S'=-1 4nZ  d^2 (  ^ab 
_a X^I_n _b X^I_n + ^2_n X^I_n X^I_n) ,
and the Hamiltonian
H'=1 4nZ  ^2d (  _X^I_n _X^I_n +
_X^I_n_X^I_n + ^2_n X^I_n X^I_n) .
We call  as "mass-dual action  "  of the action .
The action  implies that, for each mass number 
we have a light-cone action, which has been produced after the usual gauge
fixing. In other words, for each mass number "", there
is a string in the pp-wave background .
According to this action, only strings with the same mass couple to each
other, while in the action  strings with opposite masses have
coupling.

The action  can be splitted to ,
where ,  and  correspond to zero, positive and negative
masses, respectively. There is also .
Similarly, the Hamiltonian  can be written as
. The condition (6) implies
that each  (except ) separately is not Hermitian. Therefore, we
should consider at least a system of two strings with equal but opposite
masses. This system has the Hamiltonian , which is Hermitian.

According to the action , the momentum conjugate to the coordinate
 is
, ) = 1 2 _X^I_n(, ).
Therefore, the Hamiltonian  also can be extracted from the
action , as expected. Since ,
the quantization of the action
, i.e., the equation (21), leads to the quantization of the action 
as in the following
[ X_n^I(,) ,  n' (,] 
=i ^IJ  (_n+n',0 .
This comes from the mass duality, that is, some properties of one theory
can be extracted from its dual theory.

Look at the usual string theory, that is, the worldsheet fields are massless.
Under the -duality transformations we have the exchange
 , where  and .
Then, the string Hamiltonian is invariant. Furthermore, the conjugate momentum
 and the momentum
 of the string action,
exchange with the conjugate momentum
 and the momentum
 of the -dual action of string.
Similar to the coordinates  and , we have  and
. Under the exchange , the
Hamiltonian (20) is invariant and the conjugate momenta 
and  change
to each other. We shall see that the momenta  and 
also change to each other. Since we have the change ,
according to the
equation (16) the mass  transforms to . For these reasons we
call the action (30) as the mass dual action of the action (15).

Transformations of the mass-dual action 

Application of the transformation (22) on the action  and on
the Hamiltonian
 leads to the two interesting cases. One case is that  and 
remain invariant and the other case is that they transform to the action
 and the Hamiltonian .

For the case that  and  remain invariant, the matrix  is
orthogonal, i.e.,
M  ^T_n M  _n = M  _n M  ^T_n = 1 .
When  and  transform to the action  and the Hamiltonian ,
the matrix  satisfies the equations
M  ^T_n M  _n = M  _n M  ^T_-n  = J .
Note that the matrices  and  satisfy the identity
M  _n J  = J  M  _-n .
Therefore, we can write the equations (28) and (35) in various forms.
This identity
also implies that .

One may consider the action . The equation of motion
extracted from the action  is the
equation (17). In the next sections we shall consider only the action .

Closed string 

The solution of the equation of motion (17) for closed string is
X^I_n(, )=x^I_n (_n ) + p^I_n p^+ 
(_n ) _n 
+i 2 2_l 0  1 W_ln  ( 
^I_ln e^-i(_ln l ) 
+ ^I_ln e^-i(_ln +l ) 
) ,
where ,  and  are given by
W_ln = p^+ _ln = sgn (l) l^2 + (, l  = l p^+ .
In addition, we have .

The condition (6) implies that
& & x^I _n = x^I_-n ,


& & p^I _n = p^I_-n ,


& & ^I _ln  = ^I_-l,-n ,


& &  ^I _ln  =  ^I_-l,-n ,
where  is non-zero integer and  is any integer number. In other words,
conjugation changes the signs of both indices  and .
Note that  and 
for positive  and  are creation operators, while
 and  are annihilation
operators. Furthermore,
 and 
with respect to the index  are creation operators, while with respect to
the index  are
annihilation operators. Similar interpretation exists for the operators
 and .

The quantization (21) leads to the algebras
& &[x^I_n ,  p^J_n' ] = i ^IJ  _n+n',0 ,


& & [^I_ln  ,  ^J_l'n' ] = [ ^I_ln  ,
^J _l'n' ] = W_ln  ^IJ _l+l',0 _n+n',0 .
For simplification consider
& & ^I_ln  = W_ln  a^I_ln ,


& &  ^I_ln  = W_ln  a ^I_ln .
The operators  and  satisfy
& & a^I _ln  = a^I_-l,-n ,


& & a ^I _ln  = a ^I_-l,-n .
These operators have the algebra
[a^I_ln   , a^J_l'n' ] = [a ^I_ln  , a ^J_l'n' ]
=sgn (l) ^IJ _l+l',0 _n+n',0 .
In terms of these oscillators, the Hamiltonian (20) for closed strings
can be written as , where
H_osc  = _n Z  _l=1 ^( _ln 
(a^I_-l,-n  a^I_ln +a ^I_-l,-n a ^I_ln ))  +
A+A ,
for the oscillating part. With respect to the index  this part of
the Hamiltonian is normal ordered.
The constants  and  come from the algebra (43), and they are
A= A  = 4_n Z  _l=1 ^_ln  =
-1 3p^+  + 8_l=1 ^_n=1 ^_ln  ,
where we used .
According to the equation (42), for each string (i.e., for each )
 is Hermitian.

The zero mode part of the closed strings Hamiltonian has the form
H_0 = 1 2p^+  _nZ  (p^I_n p^I_-n  + m^2_n x^I_n x^I_-n ).
The equations in (39) imply that for each string,  also is
Hermitian. Let us define the operators  and  as

& & a^I_0n  = 1 2m_n  (p^I_n - im_nx^I_n),


& & a^I _0n  = 1 2m_n  (p^I_-n  + im_nx^I_-n ).
Therefore, we obtain
H_0 = _n Z (_0n a^I _0n a^I_0n ) + A_0.
This form of  is similar to .
The equation (38) gives .
The constant  only
depends on the radius of compactification
A_0 = 4_nZ  _0n  = -2 3R  = -8 3  ^2
T_2 ,
where we used the expression (14) for the radius .
The operators in the zero mode part satisfy the algebra
[a^I_0n  ,  a^J _0n' ] = ^IJ _nn' .
In fact, for  this is the harmonic oscillator algebra.

Open string 

Variation of the action (15) gives the following boundary conditions for
the open string with the mass number ,
& & (_X^i_n)__0  = 0,
fortheNeumanndirections ,


& & (_X^a_n)__0  = 0,
fortheDirichletdirections ,
where  shows the ends of the open string.
According to these conditions, the solutions of the equation of motion (17)
are
X^i_n(, )=x^i_n (_n ) + p^i_n p^+ 
(_n ) _n 
+i2_l 0 (  1 W_ln  
^i_ln e^-i_ln  
(l 2) ,  
X^a_n(, )=
2_l 0 (  1 W_ln  
^a_ln e^-i_ln  
(l 2) ,  
where  and  have definitions
W_ln =2p^+ _ln =sgn (l)l^2+(2m_n)^2 .
Note that these are different from  and  of the closed
string, that have been given by the equation (38).
The modes of open string also satisfy the equations
& & x^i _n = x^i_-n ,


& & p^i _n = p^i_-n ,


& &^I _ln  = ^I_-l,-n ,Ii,a.
The algebra of the open string also can be obtained from the canonical
quantization (21), i.e.,
& & [x^i_n  ,  p^j_n' ] = i ^ij  _n+n',0 ,


& & [a^I_ln   ,  a^J_l'n' ] =
sgn (l) ^IJ _l+l',0 _n+n',0 ,
I,J i,a,
where we have .

The Hamiltonian of the system is , where
H_0 = 1 2p^+  _nZ  (p^i_np^i_-n  + m^2_n x^i_n x^i_-n ),
for the zero mode part. Using the definitions in (47),  can be written
as
H_0 = -p 12R  + _nZ  _0n  a^i  _0n 
a^i_0n ,
where . Also  shows the number of the Neumann
directions.
If all directions obey the Neumann boundary condition, there is . In
this case,  for the closed and open strings is the same, as expected.

For the oscillating part we have
H_osc  = 1 2  _nZ  _l 0 
(  _ln  a^I_-l,-n a^I_ln ) .
Normal ordered form of this part with respect to the index  is
H_osc  = C + _nZ  _l=1 ^( 
_ln a^I_-l,-n a^I_ln  ) ,
where the constant  is
C= - 1 6p^+  + 8 _l=1 ^_n=1 ^
_ln .
The Hamiltonians (58) and (60) imply that,
for each  (i.e., for each string)  and
, separately are Hermitian.

Conclusions 
By compactifying the bosonic membrane we obtained the action of
infinite number of interacting
strings (i.e., the action ) in the quantized pp-wave backgrounds.
The radius of the compactification is fixed and has an expression
in terms of the parameters of the string and membrane theories.

We found some transformations that the above action remains invariant,
or transforms to another action, which was called "mass dual
action". The corresponding Hamiltonian (i.e., ) also transformed as like
as the action . Under some other transformations the mass dual
action and its corresponding Hamiltonian remain invariant or change to
the action  and the Hamiltonian .

We obtained quantization of the massive strings from the
membrane quantization.
This implies that the quantized pp-wave background is proportional to the
membrane tension and the slope . By the mass-duality, the
quantization of the mass dual action  was obtained from the quantization
of the initial action .

The modes of both closed and open strings depend on the mass number
"". Under the conjugation of the massive string coordinates,
the mass index of the modes changes its sign,
i.e., .
This implies that a string oscillator with respect to this index can
be creation or annihilation operator.
Therefore, in the algebras, strings modes with opposite
but equal absolute values of the mass indices, have conjugation with each
other.

The Hamiltonians of both closed and open strings
in terms of the strings modes have been obtained. 
These Hamiltonians with respect to one of the indices of the
oscillators are normal ordered.
As expected, for each string the zero mode part and
the oscillating part of the Hamiltonian are Hermitian.
