We consider a deformation of  supersymmetric
gauge theories in four dimensions, which we call the -deformation,
where the gluino field satisfies
a Clifford-like algebra dictated by a self-dual two-form,
instead of the standard Grassmannian algebra. The superpotential
of the deformed gauge theory is computed by the full partition
function of an associated matrix model (or more generally
a bosonic gauge theory), including non-planar diagrams.  In
this identification, the strength of the two-form controls
the genus expansion of the matrix model partition function.
For the case of pure  Yang-Mills this deformation
leads to the identification of
 the all genus partition function of  non-critical bosonic
string at self-dual radius
as the glueball superpotential.
Though the -deformation violates Lorentz invariance,
the deformed -terms are Lorentz invariant and
the Lorentz violation is screened in the IR.

Introduction 

Topological strings  and
its connection to superstrings
,  have proven
to be rather important for a better understanding of
the dynamics of 
supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions.  In particular,
the open/closed topological string duality conjectured in

  leads to
some non-perturbative predictions for  gauge theories

limits of superstring theory C. Vafa,

 .  Some of these predictions (coming from genus
0 computations on the closed string side) relate
to the superpotential for the glueball fields

"A large  duality via a geometric transition,"
Nucl.  Phys.  B 603 , 3 (2001),
arXiv:hep-th/0103067 . .  This relation
has recently been better understood and has led
to a striking connection between a wide class of
 supersymmetric gauge theories
and planar diagrams of matrix models (or more generally
the associated bosonic gauge theories)

However
 the open/closed string duality suggests
an even more extensive insight into the dynamics
of  supersymmetric
gauge theory.  In particular the closed string side
is an  supersymmetric theory, deformed to
 by turning on fluxes.  The
topological string
computes F-terms for the  supersymmetric
 closed string dual of the form , 

d^4x d^4(W _ W ^ )^g 
F_g(S_i) 

where  denotes the  graviphoton
superfield, and the  denotes a superintegral over
half of the  super-directions of the  superspace,
and  denote vector multiplets of .  Let us
write the four  super-directions of  by exhibiting
its  content
 as .
As pointed out in  turning on fluxes deforms
this to an  supersymmetric theory by giving
vev to an auxiliary field of  of the form



where  can now be viewed as an 
chiral superfield, which in the gauge theory
context will be interpreted as a glueball superfield.
 To write the content of  in
purely  terms we can do one of two things:  We
can absorb two 's  by expanding 
to obtain the   gravitino multiplet 
, or we can use the auxiliary field vev of the  above
to absorb them.  Turning on the graviphoton
field  (now viewed as a parameter in the 
supersymmetric theory), leads to two terms in the action








Note that the first term  exists even
if we do not break the supersymmetry from 
to .  In particular it is present even
if .  The second term  is more in
tune with breaking supersymmetry to .
If we turn off the Lorentz violating term 
then we only have the  part of , giving
terms of the form  (with appropriate index contractions),
or the  part of ,
giving the superpotential term for the glueball
field.

The main question is to give an interpretation of turning
on the Lorentz violating graviphoton background 
 in purely
 gauge theoretic terms.This question
was raised in  where it was proposed
that it may be related to making space non-commutative.  Here
we find a different interpretation.   We will find
a satisfactory answer to this question in this paper.  In particular
we find that deforming the classical anti-commutativity
of the gluino fields by making it satisfy the Clifford
algebra, dictated by the vev of  of the form,



leads to the  realization of the string deformation.
We will see how this arises in string theory and field theory
context.  The string theory derivation follows the
setup of   and the more general field theory derivation
follows the setup introduced in 
R. Dijkgraaf, M. T. Grisaru, C. S. Lam, C. Vafa and D. Zanon,
"Perturbative computation of glueball superpotentials,"
arXiv:hep-th/0211017 . 

 .  Even though the field theory argument is
 more general (and in particular includes field theories that are not
known to be constructible in string theory context), the
intuition and ideas coming from the string derivation are crucial
for field theory derivation.
We in particular
find a simple map between the superspace part of these two computations.  This
leads to the statement that the gradient of the full partition function of
the matrix model (not just its planar limit)
with potential equal to the superpotential
of the gauge theory, computes the superpotential of the
associated supersymmetric gauge theory, where the  gets
identified with the genus counting parameter of the matrix model.
This can be generalized to the deformation of the  coupling
constants in a straight-forward manner. 
This completes the interpretation of the meaning of  from
the gauge theory side.  The interpretation of 
should follow a similar derivation.

The organization of this paper is as follows:  In section 2 we
motivate and define -deformation by studying string theory
diagrams with graviphoton turned on.  In section 3 we show how
the relevant part of the topological string computation works with
graviphoton turned on.  In section 4 we discuss the field theory
limit and how to obtain the same results using the more general field theory
setup a  la .  In section 5 we discuss the physical
interpretation of this deformation.



The -deformation

It has been shown in ,  that the partition functions
of topological closed string on a Calabi-Yau three-fold 
compute the -terms of the four dimensional theory
obtained by compactifying Type II superstring on . A similar
statement holds when we add D branes ,, .
The partition
functions of topological string ending on D branes wrapping on
-dimensional cycles on  give the -terms for
the  supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimensions
which is defined as the low energy limit of Type II superstring
with D() branes wrapping on these cycles and extending
in four dimensions. The -terms take the form


    N _g, h  d^4x d^2    ( W _  W ^ )^g 
       h S^h-1   F_g,h , 

where  is the rank of the  gauge group,
 is the supergravity multiplet
whose bottom component is the self-dual part of the graviphoton
field strength


W _  = F_  + , 

with  being
spinor indices in four dimensions,
 is the glueball superfield,


  S = 132 ^2 
^  Tr   W _W _,  

where  is the chiral superfield with gluino 
as its bottom component,



 The topological string computes the
coefficients  as the partition function for
genus  worldsheet with  boundaries.

In particular the terms in  with ,
namely the sum over the planar worldsheets, gives the effective
superpotential for  as  where

 F _0(S) =  _h S^h  F_0,h . 

Combining this with the fact 
that the partition function for
the topological string on the D brane can be computed
using the Chern-Simons theory (or its dimensional reduction)
 leads to the statement that the effective
action is computed by a sum over planar diagrams of the Chern-Simons
theory, or its reduction to the matrix model
for specific class of D5 branes wrapping 2-cycles .

The purpose of this paper is to understand the
 meaning of the sum over non-planar diagrams. Among terms that are
generated by the flux
we have


  (S, F) = N  _g d^4 x 
      (F_ F^ )^g  d^2S  F_g (S()) , 

where

 F_g(S)= _h  S^h  F_g,h . 

This gives the effective action for the glueball superfield 
when the graviphoton field strength is non-zero. The question
is whether there is a purely  gauge theoretical interpretation
of the same quantity without invoking the coupling to the 
supergravity field. Does the graviphoton deform the gauge
theory in a way similar to the Neveu-Schwarz two form 
generating noncommutativity of coordinates on D branes
, ?

The relation for the topological string amplitudes and
the -terms for the type II string compactification
was originally derived using the NSR formalism, where the
graviphoton vertex operator in the Ramond-Ramond sector
is constructed in terms of the spin field. It was observed
in  that it generates the topological twist on the
worldsheet, which gives the connection between the type II
string computation and the topological string computation.
A precise derivation of the connection is rather nontrivial,
involving a sum over spin structure and nontrivial identities
of theta functions . A more economical derivation was found in 
making use of the covariant quantization of type II superstring
compactified on a Calabi-Yau three-fold, which was developed
in .

Compared with the covariant quantization of superstring in
ten dimensions , the formalism is substantially simpler
for superstring compactified on a Calabi-Yau three-fold since
the supersymmetry we need to make manifest is smaller. In fact,
the four-dimensional part of the worldsheet Lagrangian density
that is relevant for our discussion is simply given by


 L  = 12  X^X_  + p_^+
p_  ^ +
 p _^+ p_ 
^ , 

where 's are -forms, 's are
-forms, and 's are -forms.
The remainder of the Lagrangian density consists of the topologically
twisted 
supersymmetric sigma-model on the Calabi-Yau three-fold and
a chiral boson which is needed to construct the R current.
It is useful to note that the worldsheet theory defined by
 (excluding the fermionic fields
with dotted indices)
can be regarded as a topological B-model on .
The topological BRST symmetry is defined by

  & X_ 
= _  _+
_  _  ,& _= 0,   _  = 0, & p_=  ^ X_ 
,   p_=
 ^ X_  ,  

where 
with  and  being the Pauli matrices, and
raising and lowering of spinor indices are done by using
the anti-symmetric tensors 
 as usual. We recognize
that this topological symmetry is closely related to the
spacetime supersymmetry. In fact, modulo some shift of 
 by 
and ,  is
identical to transformations generated by the anti-chiral
components 
of the  supercharges in the bulk.

When the worldsheet is ending on D branes and extending in four
dimensions, the boundary conditions for the worldsheet variables
are given by


  & (- ) X^= 0,   & ^= ^,   p_= p_.  

Here we assume that the boundary is located at .
These boundary conditions preserve one half of the supersymmetry
generated by .

Let us turn on the graviphoton field strength 
and the gluino superfield , both of which we assume
to be constant. They couple to the bulk and the boundaries
of the string worldsheet as


 F^  J _J _ 
+ W ^J _,  

where  

are the worldsheet currents for the spacetime supercharges 
 . We find it convenient to work in the chiral
representation of supersymmetry,Our convention in this
paper is related to that of ,  by redefinition of the
worldsheet variables by

potentials and  noncommutative geometry,"

in which they are given by


& J _=   p_, & J _  =
 p_  -2i ^X_  + ,  

where  in the second line represents terms
containing  and
.
The second set of supercharges 
are defined by replacing  by
.
In this convention, the coupling  of the graviphoton
and the gluino to the worldsheet becomes

 F^ p_p_+ W ^p_. 

This simplifies our analysis in this section.
In the field theory limit, the supercharges in this convention
take the form,


 & Q_= ^ 
,& Q_  = ^  
+ 2i ^  x^  
.  

The boundary conditions 
identify the supercurrents ,
reducing the supersymmetry to .






Deformed superspace 

Let us analyze the effect of the graviphoton in the bulk.
We will find it useful to keep track of mass dimensions
of operators, so we introduce the string scale ,
which has dimension . As usual  has
dimension  and its conjugate  has
dimension . The gluino
 has dimension . For the graviphoton
field strength , we assign dimension .
One might have thought that dimension  would be canonical
for the field strength. Here we assign dimension 
to  so that the higher genus contributions
to the superpotential  remain finite
in the field theory limit . For example,
as we will see later, the genus  contribution to the superpotential
in the pure  super Yang-Mills theory is of
the form  and it has
 dimension  (which is the correct dimension for
the superpotential in four dimensions) for all  only if we
assign the same dimension to  and 

.
With this assignment of mass dimensions, the relevant
part of the Lagrangian density is expressed as


 L =1 2X^X_ + p_^+ p_  ^+ F^  p_  p_. 

As we mentioned, we are working in the chiral representation
where supercharges are defined by .

It is useful to note that the self-dual configuration of the
graviphoton, namely


F_  0,    F_  = 0, 

gives an exact solution to the string equation of motion.
This can be seen clearly from the fact that the perturbed
action  does not break the
conformal invariance on the worldsheet. From the target space
point of view, we see that the energy-momentum tensor for
the graviphoton vanishes for , so there is no
back-reaction to the metric.The energy-momentum
tensor for the non-zero field strength can vanish since
the self-dual field strength becomes complex valued when
analytically continued to Minkowski space.

Now let us add boundaries to the worldsheet.
For the moment, we turn off the gluino field 
and discuss effects due to the graviphoton field strength.
In the presence of graviphoton, the equations of motion for
 and  are deformed to


 & ^= F^ 
             p_   & ^= - F^  p_.  

Before turning on , the only nontrivial
operator product is that between  and 
(and between  and ) as

 p_(z) ^(w) _^   2i (z-w) . 

The relation  modifies this. If we write




so that the boundary condition is , the relation
 together with the short distance
singularity  imply


 ^(z) ^(w) &  12i  F^ 
[ z-w z - w  ] , ^(z) ^(w) & -
1 4i  F^ 
[
(z-w)(z - w) (z-w) (z - w)   ], ^(z) ^(w) & 0.  

In particular, on the boundary we have






Therefore a correlation function of
operators  on the boundary
with the time-ordering along the boundary
obey the Clifford algebra


  ^, ^ = 2 F^ ,  

rather than the standard Grassmannian algebra.
Such deformation of the superspace has been studied
earlier ,, , and it is interesting
that it is realized in the context of string theory.
The result of this subsection
has been generalized to other dimensions in a recent work
J. de Boer, P. A.  Grassi, P.  van Nieuwenhuizen,
"Non-commutative superspace from string theory,"
arXiv:hep-th/0302078 . . 

The presence of the factor  in 
means that the deformation of the superspace
 does not survive the field theory limit
 unless we simultaneously
take  so that
 remains finite. It may
be possible to make sense of such a limit since
the constant graviphoton field strength is an exact
solution to the string equation of motion for any
large value of  as we explained
earlier. It turns out, however, if one wants to preserve
the  supersymmetry, we will need
to make another modification to the theory, which
we call the -deformation. We will find that this
restores the anticommutativity of 's and
undoes the deformation of the superspace. These 
effects survive the field
theory limit without taking  to be large.


-deformation of gluino and undeforming of superspace 

Since we work in the chiral representation where 
, the supercharges in the field theory
limit takes the form,





The deformation of the superspace by  would then
modify the supersymmetry algebra as

 
&  Q_, Q_   = 2i x^  , &  Q_, Q_ = 0, &  Q_ , Q_  
= -8 F^  ^2
x^  x^  .  


A closely related issue arises on the string worldsheet,
where the constant graviphoton field strength breaks supersymmetry
on the D branes. When ,
there are two sets of supercharges  and , which
are identified on the boundary  by the boundary conditions
.
It turns out that the graviphoton vertex operator 
 is not invariant under the supersymmetry
but transforms into a total derivative on the worldsheet.
Let us consider the combination 
, which
preserves the boundary conditions. We find


  [
  F^  p_p_]
& = 2i ^  F^  d [   Y_ 
    (p_+ p_) ] &= _i=1 ^h 4^ 
F^  __i  Y_ 
 p_,  

where

 Y_  = X_  +
i __  + i __ . 

and 's are boundaries
of the worldsheet. Therefore, as it is, the
supersymmetry is broken on the boundaries of the
worldsheet. Unlike the deformation of the superspace
, which disappears in the field theory limit
, the amount of supersymmetry
breaking is comparable to the gluino coupling
 and
therefore is not negligible in this limit.

On the other hand, if the gluino fields 
are constant Grassmannian variables taking value in the diagonal
of the  gauge group, its coupling to the worldsheet
does not break the topological invariance since


_  W ^p_=2i^ W ^_  d Y_  =0.  

It turns out that
there is a natural way to modify this assumption so that
the variation of the gluino coupling precisely
cancels the boundary term generated by the graviphoton
in the bulk. That is to assume that the gluino fields make
the Clifford algebra


  _,  _ = 2F_ .  

Note that the mass dimensions of the both sides of this
equation match up without introducing the string scale
, so this relation survives the field theory limit
 without making  large. In the
following computation, we continue to assume that
 is constant and takes value in the
diagonal of . In a more general situation, we
interpret  as saying that


 W _ (x),  W _ (x)^i_ j 
 = F_  ^i_ j    mod   D,  

where  and the product
 in the left-hand side
includes the matrix multiplication
with respect to these  indices. Note that the
identity is modulo 
 
since that is all we need to cancel the boundary term.
Therefore  should be regarded as a relation 
in the chiral ring. We call this the -deformation of 
the gluino.

This deformation also undoes the deformation of the superspace .
The analysis of the previous section changes because the
gluino is turned on, and it affects the boundary condition 
of  and . One can easily show that the -deformation
of the gluino compensates the effect of the 
graviphoton on correlation functions of 's on
the boundaries and restores the anticommutativity
of 's there. Namely, 's remain ordinary
Grassmannian variables and the superspace is undeformed. 
This eliminates the  dependent term in 
 and recovers the standard supersymmetry algebra. 
This is consistent with the fact that the -deformation
of the gluino restores the spacetime supersymmetry in the
graviphoton background. 

Let us show that the -deformation cancels the boundary terms
 and restores the supersymmetry.
Since 's do not anti-commute with each other, we
need to use the path-ordered exponential,

P ( _W ^p_), 

along each boundary to define the gluino coupling.  As we will
see below such a term makes sense,  it
does not depend on the origin of the path-ordering,
 as long as the 
through each boundary is zero.  Let us
 evaluate the variation of the boundary factor
 and find


 & [
P  ( _W ^p_) ] &= 2i^ P 
 [  _W ^d Y_ 
 ( W ^p_) ] & = -2i ^ F^ 
P  [ (_Y_ 
p_- Y_ (o)
_p_)
 ( W ^p_)].  

Here  is an arbitrarily chosen base point on the boundary
 which is used to define the path-ordering.


This almost cancels the boundary terms 
coming from the graviphoton variation, except for the term
, which depends on the choice
of the base point .  If  through
each boundary is zero, this definition of path-ordering is
independent of the base point , and its supersymmetry
variation completely cancels the graviphoton variation.
For the worldsheet
with a single boundary, the condition that  vanish
is automatic, as the boundary is homologically trivial.
If there are more boundaries ,
we need to insert an operator which
enforces  to make the path-ordering
well-defined. In particular,
the dependence on the base point of path-ordering
disappears if we compute a correlation function of 
gluino fields, which inserts








Note that for these insertion, which are not  path-ordered, the
Grassmannian property of  projects the  contribution
on the antisymmetric part via .
There are no contributions from the graviphoton ,
because . Note that

is the maximum number of gluino insertions we can make for a
given number of boundaries if we take into account
the global constraint





Since  are fermionic, inserting
 gluino fields amounts to imposing a constraint


 __i  p_() = 0, 

on each boundary and the  dependent terms in  vanishes
in this case, completely cancelling .
Therefore we can compute the topological open string amplitude
for worldsheet with  boundaries
if and only if we compute the correlation function of
 gluino superfields,
consistently with the structure in .
In other words, the only -terms that make sense in this
context involve insertions of  factors of .  As we
will see in the next section, the path ordering of the gluino
vertex on all the boundaries leads in the path-integral
computation to a term involving .

The fact that we can make sense of only such -term amplitudes,
which impose the vanishing of the fermionic momentum through each
hole, strongly suggests that the rest of the amplitudes
should be set to .  In some sense, those would be the analog
of trying to obtain a non-gauge invariant correlator in a gauge
invariant theory and finding it to be zero after integrating
over the gauge orbit.

We have found that the string theory computation
in the presence of the constant graviphoton field
strength preserves the topological invariance on
the worldsheet and compute the -terms
 of the low energy effective theory on
the D branes if we turn on the -deformation
 of the gluino fields. The -deformation
also restores the anticommutativity of 's,
and thereby undeforms the superspace. 


Topological string amplitudes 

We found that the constant graviphoton background
by itself does not preserve the  supersymmetry
on the D branes. We need to turn on the -deformation 
of the gluino  in order to restore the supersymmetry. We can then
compute the -terms for this background
by evaluating the topological string amplitude.
The mechanism to absorb the zero modes of the
worldsheet fermions works essentially in the same way
as described in ,  in the case of the closed string.
The  only nontrivial part of the topological string computation
is the one that involves the zero modes of
 system.

Before evaluating the zero mode integral, it
is useful to establish the following formula
on a genus- worldsheet with  boundaries,


 &
_i=1 ^h-1  ^  __i  p___i  p_ [ F^ p_p_+ _i=1 ^h __i  W ^p_] &= _i=1 ^h-1  ^  __i  p___i  p_  [ F^  _a,b=1 ^2g 
c^ab   _a (p_+ p_)
_b (p_+ p_)] .  

Here we assume that  is holomorphic and 
is anti-holomorphic.
The factor 
 is due to the insertion of the
glueball superfield . The gluino fields 
in the left-hand side are
 deformed as in ,
and  is
defined by the path-ordering.
 We choose homology cycles
on the surface as  homologous to the
boundaries and
 associated to the handles on the worldsheet,
and  is the intersection matrix of these cycles.
Since , we can add  to 
without changing the intersection number.
This does not change the value of the exponent thanks to
the constraint 
imposed by the insertion of 

.

The proof of the identity  consists of two parts.
Let us first evaluate 

 with the path-ordering along a boundary .
If  were ordinary Grassmannian variables,
this would be equal to  due to the momentum constraint
 on the boundary. To obtain a
nontrivial answer, we need to use the anti-commutation
relation . For example,





where we used  in the last line.
By iteratively using this identity, we can show


P  ( _W ^p_
) = [ 2 F_ 
_p_()
_o^  p_]. 


The second part of the proof is essentially the
same as the proof of the Riemann bilinear identity. We start by writing

F^ 
 p_p_=-12 F^ 
d [ (p_(z) + p_(z))
 ^z (p_+ p_) ]. 

We then cut the worldsheet open along the cycles  and also
introduce cuts  between the
boundaries 
and   so that we can perform
the integration-by-parts in the resulting contractible domain (see Fig. 1).
The surface integral in  is then transformed into
contour integrals along the homology cycles , the
boundaries  and the cuts  connecting them.
The integral along  vanishes since
it intersects only with the boundaries  and  and
 vanishes for them. Thus we are left with


F^ 
 p_p_&=-12  F^ _a,b=1 ^2g 
c^ab  _a (p_+ p_)
_b (p_+ p_) &       -2F^ _i=1 ^h-1  __i 
 p_() ^ _o_i  p_.   

Combining  with , we obtain
.


3truein 1.8trueinsurface.eps  
Figure 1 : The worldsheet can be made into a contractible
region by cutting along cycles  and .   
Let us now evaluate the right-hand side of 
with an explicit parametrization of the fermion zero modes.
A genus- worldsheet   with  handles can be constructed
from a genus  surface  with a complex conjugation
involution  as , where the
boundaries of  are made of  fixed points of 
. With respect to the  involution, we can choose
the canonical basis of one forms on 
as 
so that




and normalized as .
We can then parametrize  as


&
p_= _a=1 ^g ( ^a _a
+ ^a _a+g )
  + _i ^i _i, & p_=
_a=1 ^g ( ^a _a
+ ^a _a+g )
+ _i ^i  _i .  

The right-hand side of  is then expressed as



&
_i=1 ^h-1  ^  __i  p___i  p_
( F^ p_p_+ _i=1 ^h __i  W ^p_) &= _i=1 ^h-1  ^  _i 
_j  &   [ 2F^ 
 (^a_  + ^a_ )(
(_ab  - _a+g,b )^b_ 
+ (_ab  - _a+g,b )
^b_  ) ] .  

We can then integrate over the zero modes 
and obtain


&_i=1 ^h-1  ^  __i  p___i  p_ [ F^ p_p_+ _i=1 ^h __i  W ^p_] &= 2(2g+h-1)  (F_  F^ )^g 
[det   Im ( _ab  + _a+g,b )
]^2
.  

The factor  and the determinant of the period matrix
are cancelled by the integral over the bosonic zero modes
of , and we are simply left
with . We have found that the
contribution from the four-dimensional part of the worldsheet
theory is to supply the genus counting factor
 in addition
to the standard  term. All the nontrivial
 and  dependence of  in the -term
should come from the topological string computation for
the internal Calabi-Yau space described by a , 
superconformal field theory. This is consistent
with the general statement  about the
correspondence between the topological string
amplitudes for the  superconformal field theory
and the -term computation for the Calab-Yau compactification.
Here we have shown explicitly that it works perfectly in the case
of the open string theory if we take into account the -deformation
of the gluino that is necessary to preserve the supersymmetry
in the graviphoton background.

Field theory limit 





The field theoretic computation of 
glueball superpotential was performed in  using
a suitable chiral superspace diagram technique developed in
M. T. Grisaru and D. Zanon,
"Covariant supergraphs. 1. Yang-Mills theory,"
Nucl. Phys. B 252 , 578 (1985).

 .  Let us briefly recall the relevant
part of the computation:  As in ,
we consider the computation in the context
of an adjoint  matter, with some superpotential,
though the generalization to arbitrary cases admitting
large  description is straight-forward.
  One takes an anti-chiral superpotential
 and integrates the 
out to obtain a theory purely in terms of , given by







where  is the superpotential,  is the ordinary
Laplacian.  In the derivation of this result, it was
assumed that  is covariantly constant, 
constant in spacetime and in an Abelian configuration taking
value in the Cartan subalgebra.
Moreover .  By integrating
the  out, one obtains an effective superpotential
for the glueball field 
.  The Feynman
diagrams are dictated by the interaction of , from which
one extracts the  term and puts it in
 the propagator as usual.
For each internal line  of the Feynman diagram, we have
a propagator given by

_0^ds_I  exp [-s_I2m (P_I^2
+W ^ ^I_+
mm )] , 

where  denotes the Schwinger time,  and  are the bosonic
and fermionic
momenta along the line.
Moreover  acts as an adjoint action on the
boundaries of the 't Hooft diagram. We can
remove the  dependence by rescaling
 and 
 so that the propagator becomes

 _0^ds_I
 [ -s_I (P_I^2 +  W ^^I_+ m)]. 

This rescaling keeps invariant the measure 
of the zero mode integral.


This piece of the Feynman diagram computation is exactly
what one sees as the spacetime part of the
superstring computation which we reviewed
in the last section. In fact the propagator 
is the zero slope limit of the open string propagator
evaluated in the Hamiltonian formulation on the worldsheet,
where the Schwinger parameters  are coordinates in
scaling regions near the boundaries of the moduli
space of open string worldsheet where open string propagators
become infinitely elongated and worldsheets
collapse to Feynman diagrams. As pointed out in 
and elaborated in more detail in , integrals over
the moduli space of worldsheets which define topological
string amplitudes localize to these regions. This is how
the topological string amplitude computations discussed in
the last section automatically give results in the field
theory limit. In fact we saw explicitly the  dependence
cancels out in the final expression of the topological
amplitudes. To make the dictionary complete, the bosonic
and fermionic momenta,  and ,
are the zero mode of  and
 on the open string propagator. In the exponent
of ,  is the zero slope limit of the
worldsheet Hamiltonian , and
and the term  comes
from the gluino coupling
 on the boundary of
the string worldsheet. In this setup,
the superpotential  of the gauge theory
encodes the  information on
the internal Calabi-Yau space.

For an -loop Feynman diagram,
the fermionic momenta  are parametrized by loop momenta
 () as


 _ ^I = _A=1 ^l  L_IA  _^A, 

where  if the -th propagator is
part of the loop  (taking into account the relative
orientation of  and ) and  otherwise.
Note that, if we view the 't Hooft diagram as the zero
slope limit of the open string worldsheet, we have the
relation



where  and  are the numbers of handles and
boundaries of the worldsheet. From
the field theory point of view,  is also the
number of 't Hooft index loops.

The computation in  proceeds by noting that,
in order to absorb the fermion zero modes , we need
to bring down  gluino fields . Moreover,
for corrections involving 

, each 't Hooft index loop can contain at most
two  insertions.
Therefore, if 's are Grassmannian, it immediately
follows that we need the number  of index loops
is  or more in order to absorb the  fermion
zero modes.We need  to be  or more rather than
 since each propagator is associated to a pair
of index loops going in opposite directions and
a sum over  along all index loops vanish. 
Since , this is possible only when ,
namely the 't Hooft diagram must be planar.
In this case, the product of
the propagators  in the Feynman diagram gives
the factor

 _A=1 ^l ( - W ^_I s_I L_IA 
_^I )
=_A=1 ^l ( - W ^_B  M_AB (s) ^B_)
, 

where  is an  matrix defined by

 M_AB (s) = _I s_I L_IA  L_IB . 

The integration over the fermionic
momenta  produces the determinant
.
This -dependent factor is cancelled out by the integral
over the bosonic momenta , which produces
.
Similarly
one can extract the contribution to the  coupling
constants , and
see that they also come only from the planar diagrams.


For non-planar diagrams, we have ,
and therefore we must have more than two 's
on some loop in order to absorb all the fermion zero modes.
This is not possible if 's are Grassmannian
variables in the Abelian
configuration relevant for .
Therefore non-planar amplitudes vanish in this case
by the fermion
zero mode integral. This is precisely the part of the
story that is going to change when we consider the
-deformation  of .

If  is not Grassmannian, we need to take into
account their path-ordering along each index loop when
we take a product of propagators as in .
In the last section, we saw that the path-ordered
exponential of  integrated around
a boundary  () of the worldsheet
gives the factor

 P  ( __i 
 W ^p_) =
( -2 F^ 
__i  p_() ^_o_i  p_), 

modulo . In the field theory
limit, we regard 's as  't Hooft index loops
and replace




where  picks up internal lines 's along the -th index loop
taking into account the relative orientation of  and .
Thus we can write the exponent of  as


F^  __i  p_()
^_o_i  p_F^ 
_I>J  s_I L_Ii  _^I s_J L_Ji  _^J, 

where the inequality  is according to the
path-ordering of the edges of the propagators 
along the -th index loop.


4.8truein 2.7trueinrs.eps  
Figure 2 : The path-ordered gluino insertion receives
contributions from pairs of edges  if they
are oriented as in case . On the other hand,
the contributions cancel in case .  
In fact the above expression can be evaluated
by a simple set of rules when we have only one boundary
as we will now discuss.
If we have only one boundary every edge appears twice
with opposite orientation (this is in particular consistent
with the fact that ).
Note that the expression  involves pairs
of distinct edges (for the same edge 
 vanishes).  Let us consider two distinct edges
 and  of the boundary (see Figure 2).
The contribution to the exponent of 
vanishes in the case depicted as  in the figure because
the   terms appear twice with opposite
sign, whereas in the case  they appear twice with the same sign
and so it survives.  Note that in case  if we had the ordering
 it would still survive, with an overall
minus sign relative to the case depicted in the figure.
Later we will use this rule to evaluate some examples.


Let us show that
the product of exponential of  over all index loops,
together with the usual  insertions of gluino fields,
absorbs all the fermion zero
modes 
and the result of the zero mode integral cancels the -dependent
factor coming from the integral over the bosonic momenta.
We have already seen that this is the case in the topological
string computation in the last section. Here we will show how
this works in the field theory limit. Two gluino fields inserted
on each index loop  enforce that the sum over
momenta along the loop vanishes,

 _I L_Ii  s_I _I = 0.  
Under this condition, we can prove the following identity.


 _i=1 ^h-1 F^ 
 _I>J  s_I L_Ii   _^I s_J L_Ji  _^J
&=2 c^ab  F^   _I s_I L_Ia  _^I_J s_J L_Jb   _^J&= 2 c^ab F^  M_aA (s) _^AM_bB (s)
_^B.  

To show this, it is most convenient to go back to
the identity  on the string worldsheet
and take the zero slope limit of string theory, where
we can set  everywhere on the
string worldsheet. In this limit,  reduces to








since 
 by the
symmetry of  under exchange of
. The identity 
can be obtained by expressing this in terms of the
field theory quantities.More careful
computation at the leading order in  shows


F^  p_p_-12 c^ab  F^ 
_a (p_p_) _b (p_- p_)
 = -2 c^ab F^  _I,J  L_Ia   L_Jb  _^I
_^J, 


-12 c^ab  F^ 
_a (p_+p_) _b (p_+ p_)
= - 2 F^ 
_IJ  s_I s_J L_Ia   L_Jb  _^I
_^J. 

In the zero slope limit ,
the right-hand side of  remains finite
if we rescale 
 (which infinitely elongate open
string propagators) while  vanishes in this
limit.



















 

Combining the exponential of  with
the  insertions of the gluino fields, we find
that the fermion zero mode integral is
given by

d^2l  
 _i=1 ^h-1  ^ 
M_iA (s) _^A M_iB  _^B 
[
 2 c^ab  F^  M_aA (s) _^A M_bB (s) _^B]. 

To evaluate this, it is convenient to make the change
of variables,




The integral  then becomes









As in planar diagrams,
the integral over bosonic momenta gives the factor
of . So we are left with no
-dependent factor and we just have  (with
some factors of  which can be absorbed into the
definition of ),
in addition to the  factor.  Moreover we have the
combinatoric factore of . The factor of  comes
from the loop with no glueball insertions and the factor
of  comes from the choice of which of the  boundaries
we choose not to put the glueball superfield on.


Examples 

It is helpful to illustrate the general
derivation in the field theory limit presented above
by some examples.  Here we will consider three
examples.  In the first example we show how
the computation works for the case of a simple
genus g diagram with one boundary, which in the field
theory computation arises from a  loop Feynman diagram involving
a single  interaction.  In the second
example we consider a genus 1 diagram with one boundary,
involving two 
 vertices.  In the third example we consider a diagram
with  and  involving four  interactions.
The last example is the most interesting one, in the sense
that it involves both the glueball superfield and the  term.

:

 From a single  vertex we can form
a genus  surface with a single boundary. The Feynman
diagram for this interaction involves  loops.
 The boundary
consists of  pairs of oppositely oriented edges each
of which forms one loop.  Along the boundary of the
Riemann surface they are ordered
according to the usual opening up of a genus  surface
in the form




According to the rule discussed before, for the path-ordered
gluino insertions we get




where  denotes the contraction with
.  Integration over the fermionic loop momenta
is the same as integration over the  edge
momenta as they are in one to one correspondence.  To absorb
the zero modes we have to bring down each term in the exponent
exactly twice.  This gives the factor



The bosonic momentum integral (up to factors of 
which can be absorbed into the definition of ) gives
 for each loop and so the product over all the loops
cancels the  dependence, as expected, leading to .

:


As our next example we consider a genus 1 diagram with
one boundary formed from two trivalent vertices (see Fig. 3).
The edges along the boundary are ordered as 
.
Thus the path ordered contribution gives

exp (- s_1_1 ,s_2_2-s_2 _2,s_3_3-s_3_3 ,s_1_1)  

Note that, as already explained,
 this factor can also be written as the product of
 integral of fermionic
momenta around the two non-trivial cycles of the torus, denoted
by  and  in Fig. 3.  Namely




and we have





which is the same as , up to choice
of orientation of cycles. Here
we have used the fact that , .
Writing these in terms of
 the fermionic
loop momenta  and  we have



which leads to the path ordered contribution




and integration over the  and  leads to the
factor



The  dependence cancels the bosonic momentum, as can
be readily checked by computation of  where

Figure 3 : The genus 1 Riemann surface with one boundary, constructed
from two cubic interactions.  
:

For a more involved example consider the diagram in a theory
with cubic interactions, drawn in Fig. 4.
  This corresponds
to a diagram with genus 1 and 2 boundaries.  Thus it will
contribute a term , times the amplitude of the matrix
model, to the superpotential.  The factor  comes from the fact
that we can attach the two 's comprising
the glueball field at either of the two
holes, and the factor of  comes from the trace over
the hole where there are no glueball fields.  This diagram has
6 edges with Schwinger parameters  with .
The three fermionic loop  momenta we will denote by .
The two possible choices of the holes for attaching the glueball
field both give the same contribution to the fermionic
momentum integral, namely



where by square, we mean the  contraction.
Similarly the integral over the path ordered integral of 
can be performed as follows: In this case
only one of the two boundaries contribute because
 (by the absorption of the
fermion zero modes of the glueball
insertion).  The contribution for the larger
boundary is given by the argument we outlined before, as we
order the boundaries according to 

and using the fact that ,
by





This can also be viewed as the 
, where
 are the two cycles of the torus (see Fig. 4).
Substituting fermionic loop momenta




yields




 and







4.3truein 2.8trueintwo.eps  
Figure 4 : A Riemann surface with genus 1 and two boundaries made out of
four cubic interactions.  We then need to integrate over the three fermionic loop momenta.
To absorb the  fermions, we can bring down two  terms
from the exponent, which also absorbs the  integral and so
we will have to pair it up with the  in the  contribution
to absorb the  integral. Or we can bring two  terms which
will have to be paired up with the  term.  Or we can
bring down one  and one  term which will have to be paired
with the cross term in the  contribution of the form 
in the  term.  Putting all these together we find the
 dependence is given by , where







The integration over the bosonic momentum gives the inverse square of
 determinant
of  where  is given by





and one easily checks that



as expected.


Physical interpretation 

We have seen that the connection between matrix model
and  supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions
can be made more canonical,  be extended
 to all higher genus matrix amplitudes if we make the gluino
fields in the path-integral not to be purely Grassmannian.
This lack of anticommutativity breaks Lorentz
invariance, but preserves  supersymmetry.
In this section we discuss possible physical implications of this
idea.

Even though in this paper we have mainly concentrated on the
chiral sector, corresponding to turning on
, we could also repeat this
analysis for the anti-chiral sector, by turning on
.In the string
theory context this would lead to a gravitational back-reaction,
which is irrelevant in the field theory limit we are considering. 
  In this Euclidean
context these are independent real numbers, but in the Minkowski
context these are complex
quantities and the reality (, unitarity) conditions dictate



This in particular means that for the gluino fields
 and  in the path-integral
we require,





In the case where ,  the standard gauge theory context,
we know that the glueball superfield




is the right variable to describe the infrared physics.  Similarly
here, given the link between the full matrix model computation
and gauge theory computation, it suggests that  again
is the right field
in the IR to capture the relevant physics.  We will
assume that to continue to be the case even after
introducing the -deformation.
  In particular in the IR we will
have an effective superpotential

W(S)=N F(S,^2 )S +S 

where
exp [
 1^2 F(S, ^2)]
=1vol (U(M)) d exp [-1 W()] 

and  in the above expression.  Moreover




in the gauge theory interpretation.
In the corresponding low energy physics we are instructed
to minimize the physical potential



where 
 and  is the (as yet to be computed)  potential coming
from D-term.

 There is a surprise here:
 The IR physics appears to be Lorentz invariant!  Namely
both  and  are
Lorentz invariant, and so the  is Lorentz invariant. So there
is no hint in the IR that we are dealing with a theory which
intrinsically breaks Lorentz-invariance.  In other words,
it appears that Lorentz invariance has been restored in the IR!
Even though there are examples where the theory in the IR has
more symmetries than in the UV, for example
theories which have higher dimension operators
violating some symmetry which becomes irrelevant in the IR, it is
amusing that this is appearing also in our case where the fundamental
fields have Lorentz-violating rules for the path-integral.  Note that turning
on  does change the expectation value of  at the critical
point and the critical value of , but in a Lorentz-invariant way.
It is tempting to speculate about the potential realization of this
idea in Nature.  In particular this would be consistent
with the macroscopic existence of Lorentz invariance, which
could get violated
at higher energies.  This is even more tempting since from
the viewpoint of the relation of  supersymmetric
gauge theories and matrix model, the -deformation is forced on us!
It would be interesting to explore the signature of the -deformation
for potential observations in the accelerator physics or cosmology.

Let us consider the special case of pure  Yang-Mills,
deformed by turning on .  This will be a leading
piece of the superpotential
of many other theories, in the limit where  is small and so higher
powers of  can be ignored
in the glueball superpotential.  In this case, the 
partition function of the matrix model  
 is entirely
given by the measure factor, , 
which has been shown 
to give the partition function of  at self-dual radius .
We have (up to an addition
of an irrelevant constant )





This can be written in a more unified form, up to an addition
of   which in the expression
for the superpotential can be absorbed into redefining the
coupling constant ,








It is natural to define a rescaled dimensionless
 glueball field .  In
terms of this we have





This leads to the superpotential

+ 

Note that this  defers from the bare  in the
gauge theory by



 where
 is the cutoff where the bare coupling  is defined.
Note that writing the superpotential in term of the new , undoes
the dimensional transmutation.  In other words, we now have gotten rid

constant of the gauge theory at the scale set by .

 ,
taking the -deformation
into account.  The fact that many different powers of  enter
is because  'carries' an  charge and with respect to that
 is neutral and so in principle arbitrary powers
of it can appear.  Here we are predicting in addition  very
definite coefficients for these terms. We expect, as in the case
of the Veneziano-Yankielowicz potential,
the measure of the gauge theory should somehow
dictate this structure, but we do not, at the present, have
a direct gauge theory derivation of this.

Let us analyze the critical points of this superpotential.
We need to solve  (again we reabsorb a constant
term in the shift of ):

of the Euler character of the moduli space of doubly punctured Riemann
surfaces, up to addition of .)
If   if  is much smaller than the
physical scale of the original gauge theory, then we have



This in particular is consistent with dropping the
terms with negative powers of  in  because
 (this is self-consistent,  ).
As we increase  the correction terms to VY potential
become more relevant.  Let us define   Then
we expect, after minimization, to have an expansion

to see if this function has any interesting modular
properties.



Non-perturbative completion of  and baryons 

 From the definition of   as the full
free energy of the matrix model, it is clear that we cannot
stop to all orders in perturbation theory, and in particular
we have to have a full definition of the matrix integral, including
its non-perturbative completion.  This is unlike  where we
could restrict attention simply to planar diagrams of the matrix
model defined by Feynman perturbation theory.  Thus it is natural
to ask how do we give the full non-perturbative definition of 
or the associated physical superpotential .

In order to get insight into this question it is useful to
trace back, within string theory, what turning on the graviphoton
does. On the dual gravity side, the theory is an  supersymmetric
theory broken down to  by some flux.
The topological string amplitudes do not depend on the choice
of flux .  Thus we can ask how does turning on graviphoton
field strength affect the  theory.

This question was studied at length in R. Gopakumar and C. Vafa,
"M-theory and topological strings. I,"
arXiv:hep-th/9809187 ;

"M-theory and topological strings. II,"
arXiv:hep-th/9812127 .

 .  The main idea is to relate
the turning on of the graviphoton field strength, as giving
rise to a correction to  terms which are captured by
Schwinger like computation.  Recall that graviphoton couples
to D-branes with charge proportional to their BPS mass.
 Motivated
by this correspondence it is natural to write the superpotential 
as coming from such a computation.  For example for the case
of pure Yang-Mills we would be led to

1  W()=N_^dss^2 
( s/2sinh (s/2) )^2 e^-s   


This suggests a non-perturbative completion of the superpotential
relevant for the cases with smaller values of , including
terms of the form , as is familiar from the 
Schwinger computation.  If 
these effects are
small. Note that for pure Yang-Mills, these corrections,
on the matrix model side, would be invisible:  Since 
 these terms correspond to 
which is  and do not depend on .  Thus the ambiguity
of the map between the matrix model and gauge theory data
allow for such additions.

Recall that in the string theory
realization the wrapped brane corresponds to
baryons
,  
as the corresponding brane is pierced by  units of
RR flux. Even though in the  theory
these are not as part of the excitations of the theory
(as one would have to supply the quarks as probes)
nevertheless it is striking that they can be used
to reproduce the superpotential.
Therefore it is natural to interpret
the full superpotential   as obtainable from the
baryon/anti-baryon pair production effect. It would
be interesting to better understand this statement
from the field theory side.
 It is amusing
to note that this includes the Veneziano-Yankielowicz part
of the superpotential as well, suggesting a new interpretation
for it.  For more general  theories one would expect
that there would be similar completions of the perturbative
computation, similar to that studied in  in the context
of A-model topological strings.
