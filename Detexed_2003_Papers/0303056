New algebraic approach to analytical calculations of
-dimensional integrals for
multi-loop Feynman diagrams is proposed.
We show that the known analytical methods of evaluation of
multi-loop Feynman integrals,
such as integration by parts and star-triangle
relation methods, can be drastically simplified by
using this algebraic approach.
To demonstrate the
advantages of the algebraic method of analytical evaluation of
multi-loop Feynman diagrams, we calculate ladder diagrams for the massless 
theory.
Using our algebraic approach we show that the problem of evaluation
of special classes of
Feynman diagrams reduces to the calculation of the Green functions
for specific quantum mechanical problems.
In particular, the integrals for ladder massless diagrams in the 
scalar field theory are given by the Green function for the
conformal quantum mechanics.

Introduction 

It is well known that the evaluation of
 the multiple integrals associated with the Feynman diagrams
is the main source of physical data in the perturbative quantum field theory.
Since the number of diagrams grows enormously in higher orders of perturbation theory,
the numerical calculations of the integrals for multi-loop
Feynman diagrams are not sufficient to obtain results
with desirable precision. That is why analytical calculations of the Feynman diagrams
(integrals) start to be important.

For last few years considerable progress was achieved in analytical
calculations of multi-loop Feynman integrals
(see e.g. -

 and references therein).
It is interesting that in many cases analytical results for the Feynman integrals
are expressed in terms of the multiple zeta values and polylogarithms.
Note that the multiple zeta values and polylogarithms
are very interesting and promising subjects for investigations in
modern mathematics (see e.g.,).

The analytical evaluations of the
multi-loop Feynman integrals are usually based on
such powerful methods as the integration by parts and star-triangle
(uniqueness) relation (see, and
references therein) methods. These methods have a long history.
For example, the star-triangle
 relations have firstly been considered in the framework of
the conformal field theories.
Then it was noticed
 that the
star-triangle relation is a kind of
the Yang-Baxter equation (see also).
In, this fact was used to calculate the
"fishing-net" Feynman diagram (of a sufficiently large order)
for the four-dimensional ()  theory
(as well as  "triangle-net" and  "honey-comb"
diagrams for the  () and  () theories, respectively).


In this paper a new algebraic approach to analytical calculations
of the massless and dimensionally regularized
Feynman integrals, e.g., needed for the renormalization group calculations,
is developed. In particular,
this method is based  on using the integration by parts
and star-triangle (uniqueness) relation methods.
The advantage of our approach is that we change the manipulations with integrals by
the manipulations with the algebraic expressions. This
drastically simplifies all calculations,
as it will be demonstrated by some examples.
In particular, we calculate the integrals for ladder Feynman
diagrams arising in the  field theory for scalar massless particles.
The integrals for these diagrams contribute to many important physical
quantities and have been extensively used in many applications,
e.g. in the calculations of the conformal
four-point correlators in the  supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory
,. The remarkable fact which we have observed is that
the evaluation of the integrals for special classes of
Feynman diagrams reduces to the calculation of the Green functions
for specific (integrable) quantum mechanical problems.
For example, the integrals for ladder massless diagrams in the 
scalar field theory are given by the expansion over the coupling constant
of the Green function for the D-dimensional
conformal quantum mechanics.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we
outline the basic concepts of our operator approach. In Section 3,
we explain how the integrals for Feynman diagrams can be
represented in the operator form. The analytical calculations
of the integrals for multi-loop ladder diagrams are presented in
Section 4. In Section 4 we also discuss the relation of multi-loop Feynman
integrals to Green functions of specific quantum mechanical problems.
In Conclusion we discuss possible generalizations and prospects.


Operator Formalism 

Consider the -dimensional Euclidean space 
with the coordinates , where .
We denote ,

and in general the parameter   is a complex number.
Let  and  be operators of coordinate and momentum,
respectively,
gr0 
[_k ,  _j ] = i  _kj    .
Introduce the coherent states  and 
which diagonalize the operators of the coordinate and momentum
gr00 
_i x= x_i  x , 
_i k= k_i  k ,
and normalize these states as follows:
gr1 
xk = 1 (2 )^D/2    (i  k_j  x_j )  , 
 d^D k  k k = 1  = d^D x  x x  .
We also define the inversion operator 
inver 
 
where .

The well-known formula for the Fourier transformation of
the function  can be rewritten with the help of eqs.
() and ()
in the following form:
gr4 
x 1 ^2    y= a() 
1 (x-y)^2  , ( a() =
(  ^D/2   2^2   ()  ) .
where ,  is the Euler gamma-function
and .
Note that  obeys the functional equation
. Formula ()
can be interpreted as a definition of the
infinite dimensional matrix representation for 
(the matrix "indices" are the coordinates  and ).
In this representation the operator  is a diagonal matrix
gr44 
x ^2   y= x^2   ^D(x-y)  .
We call the function  the propagator with the index .
Consider the convolution product of two propagators with the indices  and :
gr4b 
d^D z  (x-z)^2    (z-y)^2    =
V(,(x-y)^2(+ - D/2)  
 ,
where
.
This is nothing but the group relation

which is written in the matrix form ().

Using the definition of the inversion operator  ()
one can deduce the main formula
inver5 
R  ^2    R  =
^2 (+  D2  )  ^2    ^2 (- D2  )   .
Then, the group relation

 is equivalent to
the identity
uniq 
^2   ^2   ^2   =
^2   ^2   ^2    , 
(= + )  .
which can be represented in the form of the commutativity condition

for the operators .
Thus,  (for all )
generate the commutative set of elements in the algebra of functions
of , .
Identity (), represented in the matrix form (), (),
is the famous
star-triangle relation :
gr4a 
d^D z  (x-z)^2  z^2   
(z-y)^2   =
V(,) (x)^2    (x-y)^2 
(y)^2    
 .
Consider the dilatation operator 
which satisfies:
 cartan 
 H  _i = _i  (H - 1)  ,   H  _i = _i  (H + 1)  ,
 and generates the  algebra together with the elements  and :
  gr7 
  
 It is known that the special conformal transformation
generators  (), the dilatation
operator  (), the
elements  and  generate the
-dimensional conformal algebra .

Below the following relations will be important:
 
These relations are easily deduced from the Heisenberg algebra ().
We also introduce the notion of degree for the operators which are
homogeneous functions  of the
generators of the Heisenberg algebra.
The multiplicative number  is called
the degree of the operator  if
.
In particular, we find
 in view of ().

Using relations ()
and () one can deduce the algebraic identity
parts 
 
In the matrix form (), () this identity looks like
parts0 
 
where ,
, , 
and we have introduced the concise notation for the "vertex" integral
vertex 
x_1, _2, _3 y =
d^D z  (x-z)^2 _1   z^2 _2  
(z-y)^2 _3    = 1 a(_1') a(x  1 ^2_1'    1 ^2_2   
1 ^2_3'    y  .
Identity () is called
the integration by parts (or "triangle") ruleand plays a very important role in
almost all analytical calculations of multi-loop Feynman integrals.

The integration by parts rule () is a combination of
two more fundamental relations. The first one is
  difr 
4 (- ) ^2    ^2    =
1 + 1   
^2    [^2 (+ 1)  ,  ^2 ]  -
1 + 1    [ ^2,  ^2 (+1)  ]
 ^2      ,
 and the second one is obtained from () by
the Hermitian conjugation (for real  and ).
These relations can also be deduced from
() - ().

Consider the sequence of products of the operators ,

seq 
_   := (,_i, ) =
 ^2_1   ^2_2   ^2_3    ^2_4   .
Then the finite difference equation () and its conjugated version
can be written in the form of equations 
where the finite difference operators
  







generate the algebra with the commutation relations:
 for  and






This - type algebra has the central element
 which is
equal to the
degree of the operator ().

Another set of equations  for
the functions ()
follows from the star-triangle identity ().
The action of the operators  is
perm 
 
The operators () define the group
 which is a direct product of two symmetric groups
 generated by the sets of even  and odd 
 elements,  respectively. One can show directly that the whole set of the
relations  and 
is closed and combinations of these relations do not
lead to new constraints on  ().

It is well known that the dimensional regularization
procedure requires the rule:
 for all .
A more precise statement  is
gori1 
 d^D x  1 x^2(D/2 + i  )   =  _D 
()  ,  (Re)
where  is the area
of the unit hypersphere in .

In the framework of the dimensional regularization scheme
we extend the definition of the integral in
the left-hand side of ()
for arbitrary complex numbers  as
gori 
 d^D x  1 x^2(D/2 + )   =  _D 
(   )  ,
where  is the radial delta-function. It is clear that:

for analytic in  functions .

The important consequence of
the definition ()

is that now one can introduce the notion of the trace for the
operators ()
trace 
Tr (_   ) =
d^D x 
x _    x .
It follows from () that these traces are proportional
to the delta-function:
isa 
Tr ( _   )
= _D  c__i   (   )
 ,  ( c__i   = d x 
x   _    x )
where ,
 is a unit vector in ,

and  is a coefficient function which
contains the whole information about the correlator

.
The simple algebraic arguments which lead to the equation ()
are the following. Note that

and for  we obtain







which is consistent with ().



Remark 1 .
In the case ,
the operators  ()
(which are cut off by the conditions  for  and )
are expressed
as a product of the commutative operators 
and their inverse:
vtetra1 
_  
= H__1   H^-1 __1 - _2  
H__1 - _2 + _3   H^-1 __2k  - _2k-1   
H__2k    ,  ( (H_) =0 )  .
In this case the problem of calculation of the trace ()
reduces to the spectral problem for the commutative operators .


Remark 2 . The star-triangle identity () can be generalized to
star2 
 
where   are any tensors
being th-order homogeneous polynomials in  or 
() .


Remark 3.  The following relation holds:
im1 
 1 (2    a() ^2 x=
 1 (2    a() ^2 y .
Indeed,
the contraction of both sides of () with an arbitrary state  and
relation () give the identity.
One deduces from () that the vector
 is independent of
the parameters  and  and, thus, should be canceled
by the operators .


Remark 4 .
The dual analog  of the inversion operator () can be defined
as
dinver 
 
where ,  and
.


Remark 5 . Certain algebraic identities considered above
(e.g. eqs. () and ()) are related to each other by
the obvious  symmetry ,
 which is the
well known automorphism of the  algebra ().


The Diagrams 

The Feynman diagrams which will be considered
in this paper are graphs with vertices
connected by lines labeled by numbers (indices). With each vertex we
associate the point in the D-dimensional space  while the lines of the graph
(with index ) are associated with the propagator

 
The boldface vertices  denote
that the corresponding points are integrated over .
These diagrams are called the Feynman diagrams in the configuration space.

The figures and operator form of integral expressions for the
3-point, 2-point diagrams
and the tetrahedron vacuum diagram are


 



 



 

where the factor 
is equal to .

The two-loop propagator-type diagram on Fig. 2 (which is called inthe master two-loop diagram) is obtained from the diagram in Fig. 1 in the case .
The expression for the vacuum "tetrahedron" diagram in Fig.3
is the result of the integration of the expression for the master two-loop diagram
with the additional propagator . This expression
is represented in the form of the trace ()
vtetra 
f(_i) Tr ( ^-2_1'  ^-2_2 
^-2_3'  ^-2_4  ^-2_5' 
^-2_6  )  .
The tetrahedral symmetry of this diagram becomes evident if we
impose, in addition to the cyclic symmetry of the trace ():
cycl 
 
the identity (the reflection of the diagram in
Fig.3 with respect to the vertical line; this reflection is equivalent to the
permutation of the vertices  and ; ):
cycl1 
 
The last identity is deduced from (). With the help of the
transformations  and  one can permute every two vertices of the
tetrahedron on Fig.3. Thus, the elements ,  generate the
permutation group  (e.g. one can check that the element
 generates the 4th-order symmetry ).

Following the paper we add to () and ()
the symmetry (cf. with ()) deduced from the star-triangle equation
():
cycl2 
 
The symmetries  () - ()
can be realized as linear transformations of the indices  and,
as it was shown in, they
generate the 1440-dimensional finite group ,
where  is a group of permutations of 6 objects and 
is a 2-fold cyclic group. The most general analytical result for
the master two-loop diagram on Fig. 2 has been achieved in and
. According to this result, the trace ()
for  can be expressed
in terms of  hypergeometric series.

At the end of this section we stress that
to write down more complicated diagrams in the operator form,
we need to extend the Heisenberg algebra () to the multi-particle
case
,
where  are the numbers of particles.

Applications. 

In this Section we demonstrate how our algebraic methods work
using the example of the -loop ladder (-boxes) diagrams.
 We start with dimensionally
and analytically regularized massless integrals
br1 
D_L (p_0, p_L+1 , p; , , ) =
[ _k=1 ^L  d^D p_k p^2_k _k  (p_k - p)^2_k   ]
_m=0 ^L  1 (p_m+1  - p_m)^2_m  
which correspond to the diagram (, , ):


 

The dual to this diagram
is the ladder -loop diagram for the massless  theory
(the loops in Fig. 5 correspond to the
boldface vertices in Fig.4):


 

This "momentum space" diagram represents the same integral (),
but in another graphical form.
Using () and () we obtain for ()
the following representation:
br1a 
D_L (x, y, z; , , ) =
( _k=0 ^L  1 a(_k')  ) 
x 1 ^2_0'   ( _k=1 ^L 
1 ^2_k   1 (2_k  
1 ^2_k'   )  y .
Now we simplify the problem by fixing indices of the propagators as
, , ,
 and consider the generating function




br6 
=
x     (  ^2- g   ^2  (2   )^-1 
  y where  is the renormalized coupling constant.
The right-hand side of () is the Green function for the two-center operator



This Green function
has the following symmetries under the linear and inverse transformations
of the coordinates :
br1aa 
D_g (x, y, z;  , ,  ) =
D_g (y, x, z;  , , )  ,
br1ab 
D_g (x - z, y - z, -z;  , , ) =
D_g (x, y, z;  , , )  ,
br1b 
D_g z^-2   (1 x , 1 y , 1 z ;   , , ) =
x^2   y^2   
D_g (x, y, z;  , , )  .
Here  and
br1bb 
  = 2  - - =
D -  ( + + 2  )  .
The proof of () and () is evident.
The symmetry () follows from the chain of equalities




chain 
=
x    R 
(  ^2(+ D/2)  
^2 ^2(- D/2) 
- g z^-2   
^-2(+ )  (1 z )^2   )^-1   R    y =






where equations () and () where applied.


Using identities () and () one can change the indices of the
propagators in ().
In the case  (see ())
the combination of the symmetries () and () gives
br5 
D_g (x, y, z;  , , ) =
 x^-2   y^-2   
G_where
br7 
G_ ', (u,v)
= u     ( ^2 ' 
-  g_z   ^2    )^-1     v  ,
and






The function 
is obviously related to the function ()
(if we put there , ), and for the case 
 from (), () we obtain the symmetry
br8 
G_, (u,v) = G_, (v,u) = (u^2 v^2)^(- D 2 )  
G_,2-  (1 u , 1 v )  ,
(note that here we have made the redefinition:  ).

Thus, the problem of analytical evaluation
of the integrals () for the ladder diagrams
with the special choice of the line indices
 is reduced
to the problem of calculation of the Green function
for the Hamiltonian



which describes (for )
the propagation of the scalar particle in the external field of one
source fixed in the origin.
Now the most interesting cases are: 

1.) ,  which corresponds to the -dimensional
conformal mechanics; 

2.) , , 
which is related to the standard -dimensional problem
of the dynamics of a
charged particle moving in the field of the pointlike source. For  both the
cases are equivalent to each other and the Green function ()
defines the generating function for the ladder diagrams in the   field theory.



Here we calculate the Green function () and, therefore,
the integral () for general value of 
and for the choice of the indices , 
(-dimensional conformal mechanics) with the help of the operator approach.
Our method is based on the identity:
grn1 
1 ^2 -  g / ^2    =
^_L=0 
( -g 4  )^L   [ ^2  
(H-1)   (H-1+ )^L+1    1 ^2  
^-2   ]_^L 
where we denote


.
Identity () can be proved immediately if one acts on both the sides
by  and uses relations ()-()
and 
, .
Taking into account the integral representation for the rational function of 
in ()





the Green function  () is written in
the form
grn2 
u  1 (^2  - g_z/^2 )   v=
 ^_L=0 
1 L!  ( g_z 4  )^L  _L(u,v)
where for the functions  we obtain the integral representation






grn3 
= - a(1)  ^_0  dt  t^L [
( u^2   v^2  )^ e^t  ]_^L 
  _t (
 e^-t  (u - e^-t v )^2    )^(D 2 -1) 

Note that the first function is:
 and
in view of () all  possess the symmetry





The integral () for  reproduces the results of
 and. For applications it is worth having the
general expression () for  and
expand  over small :
expan 
_L(u,v) = (1-) 4^2-  u^2(1-)   
_l=0 ^  ^l l!   ^(l) _L(z_1,z_2)  .
Here the dimensionless parameters  are defined
by the equations:  and .
The coefficient functions  in the expansion
() can be represented in the
following form:
coef 
^(l) _L(z_1,z_2) =
 _f=0 ^L   (-(z_1z_2))^f  (2L-f)  f!  (L-f)! 
 _m=0 ^l (-)^m  C^m_l 
 Z _m (z_1,z_2;2L +l-f )  ,
 where  and
 we denote :
 





For example, we have









and in general the functions  are
linear combinations of multiple polylogarithms





with  and arguments  belong to the set
.
The first coefficient function in () (related to the
integral () for )
d4 
^(0) _L(z_1,z_2) =  1 z_1-z_2   _f=0 ^L  
(-)^f    (2L-f)!  f!  (L-f)!   ^f(z_1z_2) 
[ Li _2L-f (z_1) - Li _2L-f (z_2)]  ,
has firstly been evaluated in.
The next coefficient is






We also present the result for the integral ()
in the case  ) and arbitrary  which is needed for
evaluation of the propagator-type ladder diagrams:





For  we immediately obtain .


Remark 1.  Relation () can be rewritten in the form






In the matrix representation (), ()
this identity gives the analytical
expression for the vertex integral () for the special choice
of the indices (one index is arbitrary)
vert2 
xD 2  -1, 1-, D 2  -1 y =
1 4 a(1)    _0^  dt  e^t(D 2  -1)  
 (x^2  e^t)^- (y^2  e^-t )^ (e^t x-y)^2(D 2  -1)   
It reproduces
the results presented in, since the indices of the lines
in the left-hand side of ()
are changed by means of the star-triangle symmetries ().


Remark 2. 
The one- and two-loop ladder integrals ()
for the case  and 
(which are given by the functions  and  ()) have been
found in. This result was generalized in andwhere () for all 
and the generating function ()
(for the case  and )
has been calculated. The analytical results for
1,2,3-loop (boxes) integrals (), general value of  and
special indices of the lines
 can be found in
,,
,, (see also references therein).



Remark 3. 
In the case
of the conformal indices:  
the inversion method () reduces the 4-point functions
(), () (represented on Fig. 4) to the 3-point functions.
Moreover, the inversion method () gives the possibility to obtain the
duality transformation for
the -dimensional Green function







which relates (for the fixed parameters )
the -dimensional Green function for the Hamiltonian
 to the propagator of a
massive () free particle
(the dimension parameter  can be restored by the renormalization
 and ).

The inversion method () in the momentum representation
(with the help of the operator  ())
gives the duality transformation for the Green function









where  and  are dimensionless parameters. For 
we have deduced the duality transformation for the
Green function of the Coulomb problem.

Conclusion 

In this paper
the algebraic approach to analytical calculations of the integrals for
multi-loop Feynman diagrams is developed. Possible modifications and
applications of the
approach are the following. First of all we plan to
extend the method to the case of massive propagators.
It is rather trivial to generalize the integration by parts identities
(), () to the massive case. The
massive generalization of the
star-triangle identities (), () is unknown
(see, however, Sect. 3.2 in the paper).

The algebraic formulation of the Gegenbauer polynomial technique
, is also
possible and based on the identity
gegen 
1 a(')    1 ^2 =
_n=0 ^   ^n [ _w^2 > z^2   d^D z  d^D w  z   C^ _n(z w )  w + (w z)
 ]   ^-n-2   ,
where 
and  are Gegenbauer polynomials.
It is tempting to apply () for the evaluation of
 the two-loop master diagram on Fig. 2.


Finally we stress  that our methods resemble the methods used
in the theory of the quantum integrable systems. For example,
the star-triangle identity () is a kind of the
Yang-Baxter equation, and can be used for the
-matrix formulation of the integrable
noncompact Heisenberg spin chain
proposed by Lipatov for describing the high-energy scattering
of hadrons in QCD. So we hope that
the algebraic approach developed in this paper will be helpful
in investigations of the Lipatov's model.
