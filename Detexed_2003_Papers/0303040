This is exactly what the Comment asserts. 
This nullifies the critisism of the Comment even without
the renormalization of the effective action.

We also stand by our remark in Ref. [9]
of: An honest regularization of the divergent integral
expression of the QED effective action must produce 
both the imaginary part and the logarithmic term.
Only after the renormalization does the 
logarithmic term disappear, as we discussed in.
Furthermore, we remark that the logarithmic term 
plays an important role in proving the fact that the QED effective
action has no infra-red divergence in the massless limit when .
This is evident from Eqs. (10), (12), and (14) of.

One might wonder why we did not use the simple 
"mass shell renormalization" in our Letter [2]. 
The reason is that one can not use the mass shell renormalization 
in a massless theory, because it can not control the infra-red
divergence properly. And if one wants to discuss the massless limit
of QED, one must do the the subtraction dependent regularization first.
This point becomes more important when one tries to calculate
the effective action of QCD. 

The renormalization 
of the effective action gives us an 
unexpected surprise. To renormalize the effective action, one need to
define the running coupling  by 
d^2 V_eff  d a^2  _a =  ^2  
= 1 ^2 ,
where  is the effective potential obtained from Eq. (1). 
A remarkable point here is that this definition produces
the running coupling which is different from what one obtains 
from the perturbative calculation. This is surprising, because 
in QCD the above definition and the perturbative calculation 
produce an identical result. Only in QED do we have
this discrepancy. A possible interpretation of 
the origin of this difference is discussed
in.

Note Added: There is a typological mistake in.
The RHS of Eq. (24) in should have an overall minus
sign.
