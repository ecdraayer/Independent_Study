	The Heisenberg, interaction, and Schrodinger pictures of motion are
considered in Lagrangian (canonical) quantum field theory. The equations of
motion (for state vectors and field operators) are derived for arbitrary
Lagrangians which are polynomial or convergent power series in field
operators and their first derivatives. The general links between different
timedependent pictures of motion are derived. It is pointed that all
of them admit covariant formulation, similar to the one of interaction
picture. A new picture, called the momentum picture , is proposed. It
is a 4dimensional analogue of the Schrodinger picture of quantum
mechanics as in it the state vectors are spacetimedependent, while the
field operators are constant relative to the spacetime. The equations of
motion in momentum picture are derived and partially discussed. In
particular, the ones for the field operators turn to be of algebraic type.
	The general idea of covariant pictures of motion is presented. The
equations of motion in these pictures are derived.








 Introduction 


	The aim of the present work is a systematic and detailed theory of
different pictures of motion in Lagrangian quantum field theory and the
derivation of the EulerLagrange and Heisenberg equations of motion in
them for general Lagrangians, with or without derivative coupling.

	We should mention, in this paper it is considered only the Lagrangian
(canonical) quantum field theory in which the quantum fields are represented
as operators, called field operators, acting on some Hilbert space, which in
general is unknown if interacting fields are studied. These operators are
supposed to satisfy some equations of motion, from them are constructed
conserved quantities satisfying conservation laws, etc. From the viewpoint of presentday quantum field theory, this approach is only a
preliminary stage for more or less rigorous formulation of the theory in
which the fields are represented via operatorvalued distributions, a
fact required even for description of free fields. Moreover, in nonperturbative directions, like constructive and conformal field theories, the
main objects are the vacuum mean (expectation) values of the fields and from
these are reconstructed the Hilbert space of states and the acting in it
fields. Regardless of these facts, the Lagrangian (canonical) quantum field
theory is an inherent component of the most of the ways of presentation of
quantum field theory adopted explicitly or implicitly in books
like 
.
Besides the Lagrangian approach is a source of many ideas for other
directions of research, like the axiomatic quantum field
theory .
	By these reasons, we devote the present paper to a general study of
the pictures of motion of Lagrangian field theory.

	The idea for transition from one picture of motion to other one in
quantum field theory is quite simple: it consist in  a simultaneous change
of all state vectors and all operators, in particular the field ones, by
means of a unitary operator in such a way that the mean values (mathematical
expectations) of the operators to remain unchanged.
( 
For a summary and realization of this idea in the Hilbert space and Hilbert
bundle quantum mechanics, see ; see also the
references cited therein and .
) 
	To avoid confusions, in this paper we shall label all quantities in
the Heisenberg picture by putting tildes (waves) over the
corresponding symbols; , , ,
etc. Let  be a state vector of a system of quantum fields
, ,
acting on system's Hilbert space  of state
vectors

( 
Rigorously speaking, the quantum fields should be regarded as operatorvalued distributions acting on relevant space of test functions in the
correct mathematical setting of quantum field
theory . This approach
will be considered elsewhere. Here we treat the quantum fields as operators
acting on a Hilbert space as it is done, e.g.,
in .
) ,
and  be an operator
characterizing the system, ,  being the
(canonical, physical) momentum operator of the system defined by its
Lagrangian via Noether's theorem.
( 
For a discussion of the momentum operator in quantum field theory,
see .
) 
Here and henceforth in this paper by , , etc. will be denoted points
in the 4dimensional Minkowski spacetime , which will serve as
our model of spacetime. If
, , is a unitary operator
relative to the (Hermitian) scalar product
  on ,
the changes
	 
preserves the scalar products and mean values, 	 
Therefore 12.14  can serve as a transformation from Heisenberg picture,
corresponding to ,
to the 'general picture'.

	In the literature, available to the author, only the case when
 depends solely on the time coordinates  and
 of the points  and , respectively, has been
investigated; in this case, for brevity, we write  for
. Such pictures and transitions from one picture to other
picture of motion is suitable to be called timedependent 
because of their explicit time dependence. However, the example with the
interaction picture, considered in sections  and ,
shows that an explicitly timedependent picture may turn to be
implicitly covariant and, respectively, it may have an explicitly timeindependent formulation (achieved at a price of involving new, more powerful
and difficult, mathematical tools).

	The organization of the present investigation is as follows.

	In section , the notion of Heisenberg picture of motion in
quantum field theory is briefly recalled and an idea is given of how the
interaction between quantum fields is described in this picture.

	Sections  and  are devoted to the two versions
of the interaction picture, the covariant and timedependent ones. All
considerations are done in the general case of arbitrary Lagrangian depending
on the quantum fields and their first derivatives. In particular, the
EulerLagrange and Heisenberg equations of motion are derived for
arbitrary, derivative or nonderivative, coupling between the fields. Some
noncorrect assertions in the literature are corrected. The
calculations and derivations are relatively detailed; one of the reasons
being that they or part of them are directly or, possibly, mutatis
mutandis  used in the next sections.

	Section  deals with the Schrodinger picture of
motion. Regardless of the existence in the literature of some general remarks
concerning this picture, the detailed and  systematic presentation of
Schrodinger picture seems to appear in this paper for the first time.
Emphasis is paid to the fact that the Schrodinger picture admits a
covariant formulation, similar to the one of interaction picture.

	The idea of a 'general' timedependent picture of motion is
given in section . The links between arbitrary such pictures are
derived and the equations of motion in them are established. A way is pointed
how all of them can be formulated in a covariant form, similar to that of
interaction picture, based on the TomonagaSchwinger equation in
functional derivatives.

	In section  is presented a non-trivial essential
example of completely covariant picture of motion,
( 
We exclude the Heisenberg picture which, by definition, is a covariant one.
) 
called the momentum picture  as it is completely determined by the
(canonical) momentum operator and has a lot of common features with the
momentum representation (via the Fourier transform) widely applied in quantum
field theory.
( 
However, the momentum picture is different  from the known momentum
representation. The interrelations between them will be studied elsewhere.
) 
	This new picture is similar to the Schrodinger one, the latter
may be considered as its onedimensional special case. In particular,
in momentum picture the state vectors became spacetime dependent, while the
field operators  (and the observables constructed from them) transform into
constant (in spacetime) operators. Correspondingly, the EulerLagrange
field equations transform from second order differential equations in
Heisenberg picture into algebraic  equations in momentum picture.

	Section  is devoted to some ideas concerning the general
covariant pictures of motion and the equations of motion in them.

	In section  is summarized the content of the paper.


	Here are some standard notations and conventions we shall follow in
the present work. The 4dimensional Minkowski spacetime (model) will be
denoted by . It is supposed to be endowed with diagonal Lorentz metric
with metric tensor  such that
. Here and henceforth in the work, the
Greek indices  run from 0 to  and refer to
spacetime coordinates. The raising or lowering of indices is done by
 or its inverse tensor . The quantum fields
(quantum field operators) are denoted by  and are
numbered by Latin indices  which run from 1 to some positive
integer . The Einstein's summation convention is accepted, a
summation is understood over any index appearing (twice) at different levels
over the whole range of its values. The coordinates of a point 
are denoted by  and  denotes the partial
derivative with respect to . If  is a function or operatorvalued function over , the symbol  denotes an operator such
that





By definition .
The composition (product) of mappings/operators will be denoted by .
By definition  for mappings  and 
with common domain. The velocity of light in vacuum and Planck's constant
(divided by ) are denoted by  and , respectively.

	Ending this section, we would like to make a technical remark. In
the present paper derivatives with respect to operatorvalued
(noncommuting) variables will appear often. An everywhere (silently)
accepted procedure for their calculation is by following the rules of
classical analysis of commuting variables with preservation of operator
ordering . However, as it
is demonstrated in , that procedure is not
quite correct, but it is harmless in a lot of cases (in particular for free
fields). In   is shown that derivatives of
mentioned kind are mappings on the space of initial operators rather than an
operator in this space (as accepted usually). In the sense clarified
in , the classical and rigorous procedures for
calculating derivatives relative to operatorvalued arguments coincide
if variations of the arguments proportional to the identity operator are
considered. At any rate, since in this paper particular operator derivatives
will not be computed (with a single exception), we shall treat the operator
derivatives as accepted in the literature. If a rigorous treatment is
required, the considerations and results in this paper can be "mended"
according to the recipe given in .













[Heisenberg picture and description of interacting fields]
Heisenberg picture and description of interacting fields 


	In the present section, we review the general settings of canonical
quantum field theory in Heisenberg picture of motion; for details, see,
e.g., . In view of the
considerations in the next sections, all quantities in Heisenberg picture
will be labeled by a tilde (wave) over their (kernel) symbols.

	Let there be given a system of  quantum fields. The
 quantum field is described via a linear operator
, , acting on the Hilbert space  of
states of the system, . The field
operators  are supposed to be solutions of the
EulerLagrange equation(s)
	 
where  is the Lagrangian (density) of the system.
( 
As accepted in the literature on quantum field
theory , the derivatives of operator-valued
functions of operator arguments, as the ones appearing in 4.1 , are
calculated as in a case of ordinary (classical) functions of commuting
arguments with the only exception that the order of all operators should be
preserved. In most of the cases this procedure is harmless and works well,
but leads to a certain nonuniqueness in the definitions of some
(conserved) quantities. For details, see .
) 
We suppose
 to be a function, polynomial or convergent power series, of the
field operators  and their first partial derivatives
.
( 
Most of our results admit a straightforward generalization for Lagrangians
depending on higher derivatives of the field
operators . However, we
drop the investigation of this case by the following three reasons:
	(i) Such Lagrangians play some role as model ones, have a number of
intrinsic problems, and there are only some indications that real processes
may be described by them;
	(ii) Such a generalization does not change anything in the ideas and
methods in our investigation and only leads to complications in the
calculations;
	(iii) After one has on his/her disposal the results of the present
work, the mentioned generalization is only a matter of some technical details
and corresponding calculations.
) 
The Lagrangian  is also suppose to be explicitly independent of a
spacetime point  at which  it is evaluated.
( 
This is a serious restriction. It means that only closed or translation
invariant systems are considered.
) 
So, we have
	 

	In the Heisenberg picture, by definition, the state vectors from the
system's Hilbert space  are supposed to be constant in spacetime, a
vector  can represent a (physically realizable) state if
. The state vectors are supposed to be eigenvectors of
all commuting observables characterizing a given system of quantum fields.

	Besides the Euler-Lagrange equations 4.1 , the field operators
 are supposed to satisfy the Heisenberg equations/relations of
motion, which, in the Heisenberg picture, are
	 
where  are the components of the momentum operator, defined
below by 4.6 . These equations express the transformation properties of
the field operators or that the momentum operator can be considered, in a
sense, as a generator of the translation operator in the space of operators
on systems' Hilbert space of states .
( 
For some details, see .
) 
At present, there are considered only Lagrangians for which the
equations 4.1 , 6.8  and 4.6  are
compatible .

	The general framework of canonical quantization
describes equally well free and interacting fields. It is generally accepted,
the Lagrangian  of a system of quantum fields 
to be decomposes as a sum
	 
of a Lagrangian , called free Lagrangian ,
describing a system consisting of
the same fields considered as free ones and a term
, called interaction Lagrangian ,
describing the interaction between these fields.
Examples of free or interacting Lagrangians can be found in any (text)book on
quantum field theory, in .
( 
One should always take into account the
normal ordering in  which is, normally, not indicated. For some
peculiarities of frequency decompositions and normal products of nonfree fields, see, e.g., .
) 











	The decomposition 12.1  entails similar ones for the
energy-momentum tensorial operator
( 
The order of the operators in the first term in 4.6new1  is essential.
More generally, the first term in 4.6new1  may be defined in different
ways, which leads to different 'intermediate' theories that agree after the
establishment of (anti)commutation relations and normal ordering of products
(compositions) of creation and annihilation operators. However, in this work
only some properties of the momentum operator 4.6  which are
independent of a particular definition of energy-momentum operator will be
used.

	As demonstrated in , the rigorous
definition of a derivative with respect to operatorvalued argument
entails unique expressions for the conserved operators obtained via the first
Noether theorem, in particular for the energymomentum operator.
) 
	 	T ^  (x)
:=
 ^i (x) ^ _i(x) - ^ L ,
where 	 ^i (x) := L  (_ _i(x))  ,
	and for the (canonical) 4momentum operator
	 
where  is the velocity of light in vacuum and the integration is over some
spacelike surface .
Indeed, since 4.6new2  implies
	 
from 4.6new1 , we get
	 
which, due to 4.6 , yields
	 

	We should mention an important special case, named
nonderivative coupling , when the interaction Lagrangian
 does not depend on the derivatives
 of the field operators .
In it
	 
so that
	 
Hereof, by 12.4 ,
	 

	The decomposition 12.3  implies a similar one for the system's
Hamiltonian , 	 
in which  is called the interaction Hamiltonian . In
a case of nonderivative coupling, in view of 12.6  and 12.7 , it
coincides up to a sign with the interaction Lagrangian, 	 

	On the above decompositions are based many model theories,
investigated in the literature, and are elaborated a number of specific
methods, such as ones involving in-, out-, and bare states or the
perturbation and renormalization theories.







	It is well known, the commutation relations between the field
operators and/or some functions of them and their partial derivatives play a
very important role in quantum field theory. However, rigorously speaking,
they are known only for free fields or, more precisely, when the field
operators satisfy the free EulerLagrange equations.
( 
For instance, the last case is realized in the interaction picture for
nonderivative coupling between the fields; see sections and .
) 
Since we intend to consider the problem of commutation relations in different
pictures of motion in a separate paper, it will not be dealt with in the
present work.










 Interaction picture. I. Covariant formulation 



	The shift from Heisenberg picture, summarized in Sect. ,
to the interaction one is realize by means of the socalled
operator







which is connected with the interaction Hamiltonian in a way similar to the
one the evolution operator in non-relativistic quantum mechanics is linked to
the Hamiltonian . In
this sense, the operator plays a role of evolution operator
in the (interaction picture of) quantum field theory. But such a viewpoint is limited as the absence of interaction, which entails
, does not mean a complete disappearance of (time)
evolution of the free fields.
( 
However, since the main aim of quantum field theory is the description of
interacting (quantum) fields and/or elementary particles, we may write the
pure symbolical equality evolution=interaction  and treat   as
evolution operator. (The fibre bundle treatment of this problem will give
other arguments in favor of such understanding; it will be developed
elsewhere.)
) 

	We start with the so-called covariant approach which utilizes the
notion of a functional derivative with respect to a (space-like in our
context) surface  in ,
( 
The only advantage of that approach is its explicit covariance. However, in
our opinion, it is, in some sense, complicated and does not bring much to the
understanding of the geometrical structure of quantum field theory. Besides,
it essentially uses the specific properties of Minkowski spacetime, thus
making the generalization of quantum field theory on curved manifolds more
difficult.
) 

	Recall, if ,  being a vector
space ( in our context below), is a functional of a
3dimensional surface  in the (4dimensional) Minkowski
space , the functional derivative of  with respect to 
at a point   is a mapping
, ,
such that
	 
if the limit in the r.h.s. exists. Here  is a (closed) 4-dimensional
submanifold of  with boundary,  is its boundary, and
 is the (4dimensional) volume of .
Besides, it is supposed that the intersection  is not empty,
contains the point , lies in , and is a 3dimensional
submanifold of  without boundary.
( 
All this means that the surface  is obtained from  via a
continuous deformation in a neighborhood of  with  being the
spacetime region between  and .
) 

	For example, we have: 	 	 (x)  	_f^(y) _(y)
=
_f^(x)

	 (x)  	_f(y) _(y)
=
_f(x),
	where  are of class . (The second
equality follows from the first one for .)

	The equality  is a
criterion for surfaceindependence of . In the context of
quantum field theory, we put  and the surface  will
always be assumed spacelike , its normal vector  is
supposed timelike,  (or, more generally
) everywhere on , or, equivalently, if
 with , then . In this case, the functional
derivative 12.9  is a generalization of the partial time derivative.
Indeed, if  is constant time surface, , then
( 
The same result holds if the elementary regions are scale from
flat .
) 
	 
where the integrals mean that one, at first, integrates along a surface
 from a foliation  of surfaces 'between'   and
 and then along (some parameter, possibly the time, characterizing)
the foliation . One should compare 12.12  with 12.11  for
a constant time surface and ,
that is with
	 

	The basic idea of the interaction picture is to chose
 in 12.14  in such a way that in it to be incorporated the
information about the interaction of the fields. It is realized a little
below. Considerations of the interaction picture of quantum field theory
with nonderivative  coupling can be found in any serious (text)book on
quantum field
theory . However, the
reading or early works,
like 
, can help much.
Besides, in works
like  one can find
consideration of/or methods applicable to investigation of interaction
Lagrangians/Hamiltonians with derivative  coupling which is absent in
most (text)books.

	Let  be a 3-dimensional foliation of the spacetime 
consisting of spacelike surfaces,  be arbitrarily
fixed, and .
( 
On the foliation theory, see, e.g., . It is
essential to be noted, the spacelike surfaces of a given foliation of
Minkowski space transform into each other under a Lorentz transformation,
forming a group .
) 
Define a unitary operator , which
is an operatorvalued functional of  and , as the
unique solution of the TomonagaSchwinger equation
	 
satisfying the initial condition
	 
Here  is the interaction Hamiltonian density, the interaction energy density, defined a little below by 12.18c .
The unitarity of  means that
, where
the Hermitian conjugate  of  is defined via
	 
for every valued functionals  and
.
( 
In the literature the arguments of  are interchanged,   in our notation is denoted as
, which we find inconvenient and not suitable
for our system of notation.
) 

	It is said that the transformations
	 		 
	where  is the interaction Hamiltonian in Heisenberg
picture.
	The description of a quantum system via the (valued)
functionals , representing the system's states and called state
functionals, and (operatorvalued and, possibly, point dependent)
functionals , called operator functionals, is called the
interaction picture  or interaction representation  of the
(motion) of the considered system. In particular, in this picture the field
operators  and an operator  given on
 are represented by the functionals
	 

	Before going ahead, we want to make some comments on the above
definitions which, we hope, will contribute to their better understanding.

	In 12.18c  enters the interaction Hamiltonian
 in Heisenberg picture. In accord with 12.4 
it is (cf. )
	 
where  is the unit normal vector to  at . The
particular choice of  as constant time surface implies
, so that
	 
which in a case of nonderivative coupling reduces to 12.8 , due
to 12.5 .

	Obviously (see 12.18b ), the functional 
in 12.16  is the Hamiltonian density in the interaction picture. It is
supposed to be know when one works in the interaction picture. However, if
one knows it in the Heisenberg picture, then the actual equation for
 is obtained from 12.16  by inserting in it 12.18c 
which, in view of
	 

	Since the solutions of 12.16  (or 12.24 ,
or 12.25 ) satisfy the equalities
	 
we can rewrite 12.25  also as
	 
It is clear, the equations 12.24 , 12.25 , and 12.29  are
equivalent to the basic TomonagaSchwinger equation 12.16 .

	If the interaction Hamiltonians  commute
on arbitrary surfaces, 	 
the last conclusion is also a consequence of the equality
	 
which, in turn, is a corollary of 12.18c  and the commutativity of
 and ,
	 
(The last fact is a consequence of equation 12.16  (see also the
'explicit' solution 12.54  of 12.16  presented below).)

	One may ask about the integrability conditions of 12.16  with
respect to  considered as twoargument functional, is the
equality





for  and  valid or not? The easiest way to check
this is the second functional derivatives to be computed by means
of 12.24  and 12.29 . The result is









Consequently 12.16  is always integrable. Here we want to point to an
error in  where it is stated that the considered
integrability condition should be
	 
Since 12.24  implies
	 
we see that 12.30  is tantamount to
	 
which is an additional  condition on , that may or may not
hold, not an integrability conditions of 12.16 . We should note, the
pointed error in  is harmless as in this
book 12.30  is identically valid under the conditions assumed in
loc. cit. 

	It should be stressed, in the most cases the interaction operators
(functionals), as defined by 12.18b  (and 12.18c  for the
Hamiltonian), are independent of the spacelike surface  and
depend only on the point  in a sense that
	 
if  and  (or  and
 are polynomial or convergent power series in the field
functionals 12.20  (or field operators ) in which the
fermion fields, if any, enter only in terms of even degree relative to them
(counting every fermion field component in it).
( 
Proof: From 12.18b  and 12.16 , we get
















as, under the conditions specified,  in
view of the (anti)commutation relations
  for  (the
sign plus (minus) corresponds to fermion (boson) fields); the last result is a
consequence of the linearity of the (anti)commutator and the
identities 12.48  given below.
) 
In particular, for a polynomial Hamiltonian with nonderivative coupling, we
have
	 

	We turn now our attention to the equations of motion in the
interaction picture. In contrast to most (text)books, such
as , we consider arbitrary
interactions, with or without derivative coupling.

	The Tomonaga-Schwinger equation 12.16  replaces the
Schrodinger one of non-relativistic quantum mechanics in the
interaction picture of quantum field theory and plays a role of a dynamical
equation of motion for the states (state functionals). Indeed,
combining 12.16  and 12.18a , we get
	 
We emphasize, a state functional  depends on the spacelike
surface  as a whole, not on a particular point(s) in it, which is not
the case when observables and other functionals, like ,
are explored as they essentially depend on  and, under afore
given conditions, are independent of  in a sense of 12.33 .

	To derive the equations of motion for field functionals, we shall
generalize the method used in for the same purpose but in quantum electrodynamics with ordinary nonderivative coupling.
( 
We present the derivation of the equations of motion since the author of
these lines fails to find these equations in the general case, possibly
containing derivative coupling, in the available to him literature;
implicitly (and in special coordinates) they are contained
in , but these are not the explicit  equations
we need.
) 
From 12.11  with  for , we find
	* 
A [;x] x^ 
=
 (x)  _A [;y] _(y)


=
 (x) 
	 U [,_0]
	_A (y) _(y) 	U ^[_0,] 


=

	_A (y) _(y) 	U ^[_0,]

U [,_0] 	  (x) 
	_A (y) _(y)  

	U ^[_0,]
+
U [,_0]
	_A (y) _(y) 	 (x) U ^-1 [,_0] .
	Expressing

from 12.16  and applying, again, 12.11 , we deduce the equality
	 

	Let

be the Lagrangian of a system of quantum fields .
Suppose  is a polynomial or convergent power series in its
arguments  and  . In the
interaction picture the Lagrangian functional is
	 	L [
	,_0;
	 _i[;x],_ _j[;x]
	]
=
U [,_0] L ( _i(x),_ _j(x))
U ^[_0,]


=
L (
	 _i[;x],
	U [,_0]
	_ _j(x) 	U ^[_0,]
	) .
	Since 12.38  with  yields
	 
we see that the explicit functional form of  is
	 

	Now the idea is for  to be obtained an
Euler-Lagrange type equations with, generally, non-vanishing r.h.s. For the
purpose, we intend to apply 12.38  to
 
and then to sum over . On one hand, in view of the EulerLagrange
equation 4.1 , the first term in the r.h.s. of 12.38  will,
after performing the described procedure, give

Since  does not depend on
 and  and their partial derivatives
as separate arguments, we freely move  and
 through the
partial derivative operators

) 










On other hand, using 12.39  and 12.40 , we derive:
	* 
A [;x]
 =
U [,_0]
	L  ( _ _i(x) )  U ^[_0,]
 =
L  ( _ _i(x) ) 
 =

 =
L  ( _ _i[;x] ) 
+ G ^i [;x] ,
	
where we have set
( 
An attempt to calculate







by using 12.40  results only in an iterative procedure. In actual
calculation, one should write this expression as





calculate the derivative in this formula, and, after this is done, all
quantities should be expressed in the interaction picture by means
of 12.18  and 12.40 .

	 	G ^i [;x]

1 c

		[
    []H [;x]   ( _ _i(x) ) 
	,
    __j[;y] _(y)
	]_   .
	Substituting the above results into afore described procedure
with 12.38 , we, finally, get:

	L (y)  ( _ _i[;y] ) 
	+ G ^i [;y]

	These are the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion for the quantum fields
 in the (covariant) interaction picture  under the only
condition that the Lagrangians, including the 'free' and 'interaction' ones,
are polynomial or convergent power series in the fields and their first
partial derivatives.

	Let us now look on 12.43  in the case of nonderivative 
coupling. In it, in view of 12.2 -12.8  and 12.18 ,



, so that
	 
Besides, due to 12.1  and 12.2 -12.8 , the equations of
motion 12.43  take the form
	 
A few lines below it will be proved that the r.h.s.  of this equation
identically vanishes when in 
() enter only terms of even degree with
respect to fermion fields, if any. This means that 12.43  for
nonderivative coupling and Lagrangians of the type described reduces to
	 
Thus, we have derive a well-known result: in the interaction picture the
quantum fields, their functionals in our context, are solutions of the
 EulerLagrange equations for the free  Lagrangian. The
consequences of this fundamental result are describe at length in the
literature, in .

	The proof of the vanishment of the r.h.s. of 12.45  is based
on the covariant formulation of the canonical (anti)commutation
relations,
( 
Let us recall them :
	) 		 
	where .
 
viz.
( 
For simplicity, we suppose , the system is without
constraints.
) 
	 
and on the identities
	 		 
	from which, after simple but tedious algebraic calculations, follows
	 
where  and the number of fermion operators/functionals, if
any, between  is even .
( 
Notice, for the purposes of this paper, one can put, by definition,









, if all fields are boson (sign plus) or fermion (sign minus)
ones. For some details regarding derivatives with respect to noncommuting variables, see .
) 
Now the vanishment of the r.h.s. of 12.45  is a trivial corollary of
our supposition that
 or

is a polynomial or convergent power series in the field operators/functionals
any term of which may contain only even number of fermion field components, if
any. Q.E.D.

	The Heisenberg equations of motion  for quantum fields in the
interaction picture (for arbitrary coupling) are an almost trivial corollary
of 12.38  with  and their
form 6.8  in Heisenberg picture:
	 
Here





is the momentum operator in interaction picture.
In the particular case of nonderivative coupling, the second term in the
r.h.s. of 12.50  vanishes as a consequence of the supposed structure
of , 12.48 , and the
(anti)commutation relations (see 4.5a )
	 
Hence, in view of 12.7 , equation 12.50  reduces to
	* 
Inserting here













(see 12.3 -12.8 ), we see that the second term in the last
equation vanishes by the same reasons as the one in 12.50 .
Consequently, as it should
be , the Heisenberg
equations of motion in the interaction picture are
	 
provided the interaction Hamiltonian or Lagrangian contains nonderivative
coupling and is of the type specified above.
( 
The presented in  derivation of 12.52 
starts from the equality







which is not proved in loc. cit.  but it holds in the nonderivative
coupling case due to the vanishment of the second term in 12.50  in
this special situation.
) 

	Equation 12.52  agrees with 12.46 , both expressing the
fact that in the interaction picture the fields are solutions of the
corresponding free  equations. In particular, this entails the
assertion that all (anti)commutation relations for interacting fields in the
interaction picture are the same as for the corresponding free fields.

	A final remark at the end of this section. The actual computation
of the functional  is a difficult task. The most
widely applied method for the purpose is the perturbation one. Its essence
is to rewrite the TomonagaSchwinger equation 12.16  as a
Volterra integral equation, 	 
where the integral is over all surfaces  'between'  and
 from the foliation  mentioned earlier, and, then to
solve 12.53  by successive iterations, starting from the initial value
 . The result is the socalled
Texponent (or Pexponent, or chronological exponent)
	 
on the successive approximations to which  are based the perturbation theory
and Feynman graph/diagram techniques.


















[Interaction picture. II. Time-dependent formulation]
Interaction picture. II. Time-dependent formulation 



	In this section is given a very concise presentation of the
time-dependent, non-covariant, treatment of the interaction picture. It is
implicitly  covariant and its comparison with the covariant one from
section  shows what a big price is paid for the explicit 
covariance.

	Denote by  a point in  such that  (in some Lorentz
frame of reference). The transition from Heisenberg picture to the
interaction one is provided by the following canonical transformations
(cf. 12.18 )
	 		 
	where , in particular

, is the unique solution of the
initialvalue problem

We distinguish  from  by using
parentheses and brackets, respectively, to denote their arguments.

Thus  is the solution of the equation
	 
under the initial condition 12.57 . So, the -operator

	Notice, if the values of the interaction Hamiltonians at arbitrary moments
commute, if
	 
for any moments  and , which is equivalent to
	 
then 12.59  implies the commutativity of   and
, 	 
which, in its turn, entails
	 

	 
		 
Since initial-value problems like 12.56 -12.57  will be met and
further in this work, here is a concise summary of their theory. Suppose

parameter . For a fixed , the solution of

	Y(s,s_1)Y(s_1,s_0) = Y(s,s_0).
	If  is anti-Hermitian,
	 
then the chronological exponent is unitary, 	 
Useful corollaries from 12.Texp1  and 12.Texp3  are:
	 	Y^-1 (s,s_0) s  = - Y^-1 (s,s_0) G(s)

	Y(s_0,s) s  = - Y(s_0,s) G(s) .
	If  is a constant operator and
 is an integrable function, then
	 
	( _s_0 ^s  G_0 )
=((s-s_0)G_0)

	( _s_0 ^s  f() _)
=
( _s_0 ^s  f()  ) _.

If it happens that  commutes with , 
	[G(s),Y(s,s_0)]_  = 0 ,

a sufficient condition for which is 
	[G(s),G(s')]_  = 0

for any , then  is also a solution
of 
	Y(s,s_0) s  = Y(s,s_0)G(s)
Y(s_0,s_0) = _.
	At last, the above-considered interaction picture corresponds to the case
.
		

	In particular, the field operators  transform
into
	 

	From 12.55a , 12.56 , and 12.57 ,
the equation of motion for the state vectors in the (timedependent)
interaction picture immediately follow  (cf. 12.36  and 12.37 ):
	 

	To derive the equations of motion for the field operators
, we shall use the equality (cf. 12.38 )
	 
which is a simple consequence of 12.55b  and 12.56 . The
particular choices
 and

L ( _i(x_t),
	_t_j(x_t)
	- 1  
	[ []H (t), _j(x_t) ]_ 
	,
	_a_j(x_t) )
	with . Substituting in 12.65  the above expression for
 and
	* 
which follows from the Euler-Lagrange equation 4.1 ,
and using 12.67 , we obtain (cf. 12.43 )
	 
These are the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion  for the quantum
fields in the (timedependent) interaction picture.

	In a case of nonderivative coupling, we have
, in which

	* 
The r.h.s. of the last equation identically vanishes as a result of the
equal-time canonical (anti)communion relations  4.5c 
in our case





and arguments similar to the ones leading from 12.45  to 12.46 .
Therefore, in a case of nonderivative coupling, the EulerLagrange
equations of motion in the (timedependent) interaction picture are
	 
and, as one can expect, coincide with the free  equations for the
non-free  fields.

	The derivation of Heisenberg equation of motion in the time-dependent
interaction picture is completely trivial. Recalling that in the Heisenberg
picture they are given by 6.8 , after the canonical
transformation 12.55  they take the form (cf. 12.50 )
	 		 
	where 12.64  and  were
taken into account for the derivation of 12.71a  which, regardless of
the coupling, derivative or nonderivative, always has a form of a free
equation. Of course, for a nonderivative coupling these equations take the
free form
	 
as a result of 12.7 .










 Schrodinger picture 


	The connection between Heisenberg and Schrodinger pictures in
quantum field theory is similar to the one in (nonrelativistic) quantum
mechanics  with the simplification that
in field theory the (total) Hamiltonian is a constant in time operator as
closed systems (with conserve 4momentum) are considered. Since in the
general formalism this simplification is not quite essential, we shall
neglect it and, respectively, the Hamiltonian will be written with a time
argument . The idea of Schrodinger picture is the time dependence of
the field operators  and observables constructed from them (in, e.g.,
Heisenberg picture) to be transferred entirely on the state vectors, the
former ones should become timeindependent, while the latter ones
become timedependent.

	Suppose, we have a system of quantum fields with 4-momentum
 and Hamiltonian
, both given in the Heisenberg picture
(in which all quantities are labeled by tilde above their kernel symbol).
The transition from the Heisenberg picture to
Schrodinger one is performed in the same way as from Heisenberg picture to
the timedependent interaction one, as described in
Sect. , with the only difference that the
interaction Hamiltonian  must be replaced by the
total Hamiltonian 

(which is timeindependent for closed systems). Therefore, the
mappings 12.55  realize the transition (from Heisenberg) to
Schrodinger picture if the operator  is the
unique solution of the equation (cf. 12.56 )
	 
under the initial conditions 12.57 , .
Here
	 
with
	 
So, if  is given,  is a solution of
(cf. 12.58new1  and 12.58new2 )
	 
If we take into account that for a closed system  is a constant
of motion,  or
, then,
by 12.Texp9 -12.Texp13 ,
	 
which considerably simplifies some calculations.

	In Schrodinger picture the state vectors, given via 12.55a 
with the operator  defined above, are solutions of the
initialvalue problem (cf. 12.61  and 12.62 )
	 

	The Euler-Lagrange equations for the field operators, given
via 12.60  with above , are (cf. 12.68 )
	 








Here,
	 
where , is the Lagrangian in Schrodinger picture and,
as in Sect. , in the partial derivative
 the expression 
means the corresponding argument of the Lagrangian/Hamiltonian, and
not  the value of  at a point , not
 which identically
vanishes (in the Schrodinger picture) by the proved below
equation 12.81a . (The last means that one, at first, has to perform
the differentiation relative to  and, then, to set this
argument to zero.)
Repeating the procedure leading from 12.68  to 12.70 , we see
that in Schrodinger picture the EulerLagrange equations for a
nonderivative coupling are (cf. 12.70 )
	 
A few lines below, it will be proved that the terms, containing time
derivatives in 12.78  and 12.80 , vanish and,
consequently, equations 12.78  and 12.80   are equivalent
to 12.81new  and 12.81new1 , respectively.

	The Heisenberg equations of motion for  in the
Schrodinger picture are (cf. 12.71 )
	 		 
	and are obtained by the same method as 12.71  with the only difference
that  should be used instead of
. In the nonderivative coupling case, 12.81b 
transforms into the same equality with
  for  , ,
but 12.81a  remains unchanged.

	Equation 12.81a  shows that, as we stated at the beginning of
the present section, in Schrodinger picture the field operators are
timeindependent. Obviously, the same is true for operators constructed
from them and their spacial derivatives (of finite order).

	These observations imply an important corollary: since the
Lagrangians and Hamiltonians are supposed to be constructed from the field
operators and their first partial derivatives as polynomials or convergent
power series, the time derivatives of a Lagrangian/Hamiltonian or some its
partial derivatives (with respect to coordinates and/or field operators or
their first partial derivatives) identically vanish in the Schrodinger
picture. In particular, the terms containing time derivatives in 12.78 
vanish. This proves that 12.78  is equivalent to
	 
which, in view of 12.80 , in the nonderivative coupling case reduces
to
	 

	The above presentation of the Schrodinger picture can be called
timedependent due to its explicit dependence on the time coordinates.
However, this exposition  turns to be implicitly covariant  and it
admits an explicit covariant formulation which is completely similar to the
one of the interaction picture in Sect. . The covariant
formulation of the Schrodinger picture can be obtained from the one of
interaction picture, given in Sect. , by replacing the
interaction Hamiltonians  and 
by the corresponding total Hamiltonians
 and
.
Below we give a concise sketch of this procedure.

	Suppose a unitary operator
 is defined as the solution of
	 
satisfying the initial condition
	 
where 
	 
with  being the (total) Hamiltonian in Heisenberg picture.
( 
Actually  and  do
not depend on  by virtue of the conservation of 4momentum for a
closed (translation invariant) system. This simplification is not quite
essential for the following.
) 
The general transformations 12.18 , with above defined
'operator', give the transition from Heisenberg picture to
Schrodinger one in covariant formulation.

	The evolution of the state functionals 12.18a  is governed by
the initialvalue problem ()
	 
while the field functionals 12.20  are solutions of the EulerLagrange equations 12.43  in which
	 	G ^i [;x]
=
G ^i ( _i[;x],__j[;x] )

		[
    H [;x]   ( _ _i(x) ) 
	,
    __j[;y] _(y)
	]_ 
 .
	
	At last, the Heisenberg equations of motion are (cf. 12.50 )
	 
From where, for , we get

[Links between different time-dependent pictures of motion]
Links between different time-dependent pictures of motion 


	In the present section, we briefly summarize the connections between
different timedependent pictures (representations) of motion in
Lagrangian quantum field theory.

	Let the index  labels a given picture of motion; in
particular, it can take the values , , and
 for, respectively, Heisenberg, Schrodinger, and Interaction
picture.

	Suppose, the time evolution  of a state vector
 is described via an evolution operator 
, 	 
for any instants of time  and . The operator 
is, by definition, unitary and is defined as the unique solution of the
initialvalue problem
	 
where  is a given operator-valued function of
time, connected to the Hamiltonian in the  picture and, hence,
it is an operatorvalued functional of the field operators and their
derivatives. Notice, 12.83  corresponds to the Schrodinger equation
	 
for a state vector .

	The transition from an -picture to an -picture is
performed by means of an unitary  'operator'
	 
that is, we have
	 		 
	The 'operator' is a solution of the initial-value problem
	 
which is a consequence of 12.83 , 12.84 , and 12.85new .

	In particular, if one stars from, e.g., the Schrodinger picture,
then   is the
Hamiltonian in the Schrodinger picture,  is a
solution of
	 
and
	 		 
	where
	 
with





 being the interaction Hamiltonian in
Schrodinger picture and  being the 'free'
evolution operator in Schrodinger picture,
	 
Besides, in accord with 12.85new , the operator
	 
is responsible for the transition
.

	If the equations of motion for the field operators are known in a
picture , in other picture  they can be derive from the
equality
	 	A ^t 
=
	U ^A ^ (x_t) t  	(U ^)^-1 


+
[
H  ^	- H  ^,
A ^]_ 
	which is a consequence of 12.86b . Here
	 
Since 12.92new  can be obtained from 12.63  by the changes
	 
we can immediately obtain, from 12.68 , the Euler-Lagrange equation of
motion in a picture  if in a picture  they are 4.1 
(with  for  and  for
):

	 
The same equations, of course, can be derived if one follows step-by-step the
procedure for derivation of 12.68  in which 12.66  will be
replaced by
	 

	Similarly (see 12.92new ), if in a picture  the
Heisenberg equations of motion are
	 
then in a picture  they are (cf. 12.71 )
	 		 
	
	If  and , in view
of 12.90 , it is a simple checking to be seem that the above results
reduce to the corresponding ones from Sect. .

	At this point, we would like to show how the analogue
of the 'general' picture of motion from quantum
mechanics  can be described via
the scheme presented here. Suppose, in some  picture of motion
are known the time equations of motion for the state vectors,
i.e. 12.85 , and for the observables, 	 
for some operator-valued function  which is polynomial or convergent power
series in its operator arguments. The problem is, if there is given a
unitary  operator , to describe the
quantum evolution (in time) in the picture  with
'operator'
	 
	From 12.85  and 12.86a , we derive the (time) equations
of motion for state vectors in the picture:
	 
where
	 
Respectively, the (time) evolution operator ,
corresponding to equation 12.100 , is the solution of the initialvalue problem
	 
and determines the evolution of state vectors, 	 

	The Heisenberg equations of motion for the observables in the
picture follow from 12.98  and 12.92new  and are:
	 
where, in view of 12.101 ,






 , was used.

	If , if the Schrodinger picture is taken as a
basic one to start off, the above results reproduce part of the ones
in .

	We leave the derivation of the Euler-Lagrange equation of motion in
the  picture to the reader, as an exercise.

	The time-dependent pictures considered above are
explicitly timedependent  but they are implicitly
covariant . This can be proved by replacing the state vectors and field (and
other) operators by corresponding state functionals and field (and other
operator) functionals  depending on a spacelike surface  from
a foliation  of the spacetime . The basic moment is the
replacement of 12.83  and 12.84  by, respectively,
TomonagaSchwinger equation (cf 12.16 )
	 
and the initial condition (cf. 12.17 )
	 
Here
	 
with  being the Hamiltonian in time-dependent
picture. (Note the connection
 
with the Hamiltonian appearing in 12.83 .) Then, the
transformations 12.18 , with the just defined
'operator' , realize the
transition to the new covariant  picture. Further one
should follow the exposition of the covariant interaction picture of
Sect.  with the only change that the interaction Hamiltonian(s)
must be replace by the total Hamiltonian(s),  etc. The concrete
results of the realization of this procedure are similar to the ones of
Sect.  and at the end of Sect.  and
will not be written here.









The momentum picture 
	

	Regardless of the existence of a covariant formulation of the well
known standard Schrodinger picture, it still has tracks of a timedependence: as the surfaces  and , as well as other ones
'between' them, must belong to a family of surfaces, forming a foliation
 of the spacetime . These surfaces should be 'labeled' somehow
which, in a sense, is equivalent to to the (implicit) introduction of a time
coordinate.
( 
The same arguments are valid for any time-dependent picture of motion, not
only for the Schrodinger one.
) 
Our opinion on this phenomenon is that the Schrodinger picture,
as considered in the literature and in Sect. , does not
correspond to the (special relativistic) spirit of quantum field theory and
simply partially copies a similar situation in quantum mechanics. Indeed, in
quantum mechanics, in the Schrodinger/Heisenberg picture, the wavefunctions
depend/don't depend on the time, while for the observables the situation is an
opposite one. This state of affairs is (mutatis mutandis ) transferred
in quantum field theory. But in it there are four, not one as in quantum
mechanics, coordinates. As a result in the Heisenberg picture, as everywhere
is accepted, the state vectors are constant in spacetime , not only in
time, while the observables and field operators depend on a spacetime point
where they are evaluated. Correspondingly, by our opinion, it is quite more
natural one to expect that in the Schrodinger picture of motion of quantum
field theory the state vectors to depend on a spacetime point, not only on
its time coordinate, and the field operators (and observables constructed
from them) to be constant in spacetime, not only in time. Such a picture
(representation) of (canonical) quantum field theory  exists and we call it
the momentum picture .
( 
The term 4-dimensional momentum picture is also suitable because, as we
shall see below, there exist 'intermediate' momentum pictures in which
the state vectors depend on some , , of the coordinates, while
the field operators do not depend on these  coordinates; the cases 
and  reproduce the standard Heisenberg and Schrodinger pictures,
respectively, and the case  gives the momentum picture. Elsewhere we
shall show that in momentum picture are reproduced all results from the
momentum representation of Heisenberg picture of motion. The name 'momentum
picture' comes from here and the essence of the proposed new picture of
motion.
) 
Below we describe the basic characteristics of this new picture of quantum
field theory.

	Let  and  be the
4-momentum operator of a system of quantum fields. By 
we shall denote a spacetime index over which a summation is not assumed 
when it appearance more than ones in some expression.

	Define '-operators'
, 
as solutions of the initialvalue problems
	 	U _(x^,x_0^) x^ 
=
P _ (x) U _(x^,x_0^)
	where
( 
The last equality in 12.108  follows from the commutativity between
 and  or
 as the last two operators are constant.
) 
	 	P _ (x)
:=
U _(x^,x_0^) P _ 
U _^-1 (x^,x_0^).
	Notice, since  and , the
operator  is the same
one, defined via 12.73  and 12.57 , by means of which the
transition form Heisenberg to (timedependent) Schrodinger picture is
performed. Since   are constant, independent of
 or , operators, which expresses the energymomentum
conservation for translation invariant systems, the explicit form of
  is
	 
where  is not  a summation index and 12.108  was applied.

	The operator 12.109 , as well as the operators
( 
Since the components  of the momentum operator
commute  and   is
considered as a real parameter by which  is multiplied,
the operators  also commute, we
have







Therefore the order in which the mappings
 appear
in 12.110 -12.112  below is inessential.
) 
	 

	 	U __1,_2,_3 
	(x^_1 ,x^_2 ,x^_3 ,
	x_0^_1 ,x_0^_2 ,x_0^_3 )

:=
U __1 (x^_1 ,x_0^_1 )U __2 (x^_2 ,x_0^_2 )U __3 (x^_3 ,x_0^_3 )

 =
(_	(x^P _ 
    )
	
	 	U (x,x_0)

 =
( _(x^P _  ) ,
	where  are different  and
 is ordinary summation index, can be taken as 'operators' and via the transformations 12.14  and 12.15  define a
transition to new pictures of motion, which we call
dimensional momentum pictures  with k=1,2,3,4
for 12.109 -12.112  respectively.  Evidently, the case 
corresponds to the ordinary, timedependent, Schrodinger picture. For
completeness, the case  will be identified with the Heisenberg picture
of motion. Below we shall be interested in the case  for which the
special name the momentum picture  will be used.

	In a sense of 12.112  (and its consequences presented below),
this new picture of motion is a composition (product) of four ordinary
(coordinate dependent) Schrodinger pictures, by one for each of the four
spacetime coordinates. As a result of this, one can expect in the momentum
picture the field operators (and observables which are polynomial in them) to
be constant in spacetime, contrary to the state vectors. Such a conclusion is
immediately confirmed by the observation that 12.112  is exactly the
(representation of the) spacetime translation operator (with parameter
) acting on the operators on system's Hilbert space.

	By 12.14 , the transition from Heisenberg to momentum picture is
given by the formulae:
	 
In particular, the field operators transform as
	 

	Since from 12.112  and 12.107  follows
	 
due to 12.113 , we see that the state vectors  in
momentum picture are solutions of the initialvalue problem
	 
which is the 4-dimensional analogue of a similar problem for the Schrodinger
equation in quantum mechanics.

	By virtue of 12.112 , or in view of the independence of
 of , the solution of 12.117  is
	 
Thus, if   is an eigenvector of
 ()
with eigenvalues ,
	 
we have the following explicit  form of the state vectors
	 
It should clearly be understood, this is the general form of all state
vectors  as they are eigenvectors of all (commuting)
observables , in particular, of the 4momentum
operator.

	To derive the equations of motion for the field operators and
observables in the new momentum picture, we shall apply the equality
	 
due to 12.115 . Substituting here the Heisenberg equations of
motion 6.8 , we get
	 
which means that in momentum picture the field operators are constant
operators , they are spacetimeindependent operators. This is also
an evident corollary of the fact that the induced by the
operator 12.112  action on operators simply translates their arguments
by the value . Evidently, a similar result,
	 
is valid for any observable constructed from the field operators and their
partial derivatives of finite order (in Heisenberg picture) as a polynomial
or convergent power series.

	A natural question now arises: What happens with the Euler-Lagrange
equations for the field operators in momentum picture? The answer turns to be
quite amazing and natural at the same time: they transform into an
algebraic  equations for the constant field operators 12.123 .

	Performing a calculation similar to the one in 12.67 , we find
the functional form of the Lagrangian in momentum picture
(see equations 12.121new  and 12.122 )
	 
where we have omit the argument  in the last row as all quantities in
it are constant in spacetime. Now we shall transform the Euler-Lagrange
equations 4.1  into momentum picture. The first term in 4.1 
transforms into
	* 
where
	 
and we have used that

as a result of 12.115 ,

	where we used 12.116 ,
,
and  by virtue of 12.122  and that
 is polynomial or convergent power series in the field
operators (see 12.128 ).

	Inserting the above results into
  with the dots
denoting the l.h.s. of 4.1 , we, finally, get the EulerLagrange equations in momentum picture  as
	 
Since  is supposed to be polynomial or convergent power series  in
its arguments, the equations 12.129   are algebraic , not
differential, ones (if  is considered an given known operator).
This result is a natural one in view of 12.122 .

	We shall illustrate the above general considerations on the almost
trivial example of a free Hermitian scalar field , described
in Heisenberg picture by the Lagrangian






with  and  ,
and satisfying the KleinGordon equation
,
. In momentum picture

which, in view of 12.129 ,
 , and
 
is a solution of

As a simple exercise, the reader may wish to prove that the D'Alembert
operator (on the space of operatorvalued functions) in momentum
picture is






(Hint: from the relation

  (see ), follows that





;
now prove that in the momentum picture
.)
Now, the equation 12.131  follows immediately from here and the 'usual'
KleinGordon equations. Evidently, the obtained representation of the
D'Alembert operator is valid in any picture of motion.
) 
	 
This is the Klein-Gordon equation in momentum picture .

	The Euler-Lagrange equations 12.129  are not enough for
determination of the field operators . This is due to the simple
reason that in them enter also the components  of the
(canonical) momentum operator 4.6  which, in view
of 4.6new1 -4.6  and 2.1 , are functions (or functionals)
of the field operators. Hence, a complete system of equations for the field
operators should consists of 12.129  and an explicit connection between
them and the momentum operator.

	A detailed presentation of quantum field theory in momentum picture
will be given elsewhere.








Covariant pictures of motion 
	

	Suppose  is depending on 
unitary operator, .
According to the general rules 12.14  and 12.15 , the
transformations
	 		 
	define a transition from Heisenberg picture of motion to a new one which,
for brevity, will be called the picture. Evidently, for a
fixed point , the below written choices 8.2 
and 8.3  describe the momentum picture and the 'initial' Heisenberg
one, respectively. The purpose of this section is a brief derivation of the
equations of motion in the picture.

	In accord with the general transformation 8.1b , the partial
derivative  of an operator 
transforms into










Therefore
	 
	_A (x)
U (x)(_A (x))U ^-1 (x)
=
_A (x)
	+ [A (x), H _(x)]_ 

where  is given via 8.1b  and we have
introduced the shorthand 
	 H _(x) := (_U (x)) U ^-1 (x) .

In particular, for the field operators ,
8.1b  and 8.5  respectively read 
	  _i(x)  _i(x)
=
U (x) _i(x)U ^-1 (x)

	 _ _i(x)
U (x)(_ _i(x))U ^-1 (x)
=
__i(x) + [_i(x), H _(x)]_  .
	
	Let the system's Lagrangian
 be
polynomial or convergent power series in the field operators and their first
partial derivatives. Then, repeating the steps in 12.125  and
applying 8.6  and 8.7 , we find the Lagrangian in the
picture as
	 

	Now we intend to transform the Euler-Lagrange equations 4.1  in
picture. Introducing, for brevity, the notation

	 
we see that the first term in the l.h.s. of 4.1  transforms into






while the second term in it, in view of 8.4 , transforms into





where

and









Combining the above results, we get the Euler-Lagrange equations in
picture  as
	 	
L (_j,y_l (x))  _i(x) 
-  x^ 
  ( L (_j(x),y_l (x))  y_i (x)  )


-
[
L (_j,y_l (x))  y_i (x) 
,
H _  (x)
]_ 

_ y_j (x)
	= __j(x) + [_j(x),H _ (x)]_   
=0 .
	
	In view of 6.8 , 8.7  and 8.1b , the
Heisenberg equations/relations in picture  are
	 	[_i(x),P _(x)]_ 
=
 __i(x) + [_i(x),H _ (x)]_  

or, equivalently, 
	[_i(x),P _(x) -H _ (x)]_ 
=
__i(x)

where, in conformity with 8.1b ,  is the
momentum operator in  picture,  
	P _(x) := U (x)P _U ^-1 (x) .

Evidently, the equations 8.12  hold in any picture of
motion while 6.8  are valid if and only if 
	[_i(x),H _ (x)]_  = 0 .
	
	Combining 8.11  and 8.10 , we can write the
Euler-Lagrange equations in picture also as
	 	
L (_j,y_l (x))  _i(x) 
-  x^ 
  ( L (_j(x),y_l (x))  y_i (x)  )


-
[
L (_j,y_l (x))  y_i (x) 
,
H _ (x)
]_ 

_ y_j (x) = [_j(x),P _ (x)]_   
= 0 .
	
	The spacetime evolution of the state vectors is an almost trivial
corollary of the transformation 8.1a . Indeed, let  be the
value of a state vector  at a fixed point ,
, then, by virtue of 8.1a , we have
	 	X (x) = U (x,x_0) ( X (x_0) )

where the operator 
	U (x,x_0) := U (x) U ^-1 (x_0)
	has a sense of an evolution operator  in -picture.

	It is obvious, the choices
	 
	U (x) = (x^P _

	U (x) = (x) _[C]0

of the operator  select the transition from
Heisenberg picture to an picture with 
	H _(x) = P _(x)

	H _(x) = (x) (_(x))  _	 and, consequently, describe the momentum and Heisenberg pictures,
respectively.

	If one studies the angular momentum properties of a quantum system,
it may turn to be useful the 'angular momentum picture', for which
	 
where  are the components of the (total) angular momentum
operator and  are (pointdependent) parameters of a
Lorentz 4rotation. Similarly, the 'charge picture', for which
	 
where  is the (electric) charge constant,  is the (total) charge
operator and  is a real parameter, may turn to be essential in the
study of the 'charge properties' of quantum fields.

	As (non-covariant) versions of the 'angular momentum picture' can be
considered the 'orbital angular momentum picture' and 'spin momentum picture'
for which  is given by 8.19  with the orbital angular
momentum operator  and spin angular momentum operator
, respectively, for .

	As (covariant) variant of the 'charge picture' can be considered the
'local charge picture' or 'gauge picture' described via 8.20  with
 being a scalar function of .









 Conclusion 


	A unitary transformation of the operators and state vectors is the
leading idea of the pictures of motion in quantum field theory (and in
quantum mechanics as well). In this way, starting form some concrete
'picture', one obtains different and equivalent representations of the whole
theory. The value of these representations is that in them vanish some
quantities and in this way one can concentrate his/her attention on the
remaining ones. For instance:
 

	(i) In Heisenberg picture vanish the partial derivatives of the
state vectors, in it they are constant, contrary to the field operators.

	(ii) In Schrodinger picture disappear the time derivatives of the
field operators, which is balanced by appearance of time dependence in the
state vectors.

	(iii) In interaction picture are zero some terms in the EulerLagrange equations of motion so that they have a form of free equations.

	(iv) In momentum picture vanish the partial derivatives of the field
operators, they are constant in it, but the state vectors become spacetime
dependent.

	
	As we saw in this paper, the time-dependent pictures of motion, like
Schrodinger and interaction ones, admit similar 'covariant' formulations,
but, by our opinion, in them the time dependence is also presented in a latent
form. The covariant pictures of motion suit best to the special relativistic
spirit of quantum field theory; typical examples of them are the Heisenberg
and momentum ones.

	In principle, one can consider also pictures of motion intermediate
between the timedependent and covariant ones, like the dimensional, , momentum picture; however, it seems that at present
such pictures have no applications.

	Generally, for different purposes, different pictures of motion may
turn to be convenient.

	The proposed in this work momentum picture will be investigated at
length elsewhere.

	The Heisenberg, interaction, and Schrodinger pictures of motion are
considered in Lagrangian (canonical) quantum field theory. The equations of
motion (for state vectors and field operators) are derived for arbitrary
Lagrangians which are polynomial or convergent power series in field
operators and their first derivatives. The general links between different
timedependent pictures of motion are derived. It is pointed that all
of them admit covariant formulation, similar to the one of interaction
picture. A new picture, called the momentum picture , is proposed. It
is a 4dimensional analogue of the Schrodinger picture of quantum
mechanics as in it the state vectors are spacetimedependent, while the
field operators are constant relative to the spacetime. The equations of
motion in momentum picture are derived and partially discussed. In
particular, the ones for the field operators turn to be of algebraic type.
	The general idea of covariant pictures of motion is presented. The
equations of motion in these pictures are derived.
