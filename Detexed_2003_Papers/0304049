Nonlinear field equations for totally symmetric
bosonic massless fields of all spins  in any dimension are presented.











Higher spin (HS) gauge theories are  theories of gauge fields of all
spins (see e.g. for  a review).
 Because HS gauge symmetries are infinite-dimensional,
HS gauge theories may correspond to
most symmetric vacua of a theory of fundamental interactions
presently identified with superstring theory.
The problem is to introduce interactions of  HS fields
in a way compatible with  nonabelian
HS gauge symmetries containing diffeomorphisms and Yang-Mills symmetries.
Full nonlinear dynamics of HS gauge fields
has been  elaborated so far at the level of equations of motion
for  which is the simplest nontrivial case
since HS gauge fields do not propagate if .
Some lower order interactions of HS fields in the framework
of gravity were
worked out at the action level for  and for  . As a result, it was found out that
(i) consistent HS theories contain infinite sets of
infinitely increasing spins;
(ii) HS gauge
interactions contain higher derivatives;
(iii) in the framework of gravity, unbroken
HS gauge symmetries require a non-zero cosmological constant;
(iv)  HS symmetry algebras
 are certain star product algebras
.
The properties (i) and (ii) were deduced in the
earlier work on  HS interactions in flat space.

The feature that unbroken
HS gauge symmetries require a non-zero cosmological constant
is  crucial in several respects. It
explains why the analysis HS-gravitational interactions
in the framework of the expansion near the flat
background led to negative conclusions .
The -matrix
Coleman-Mandula-type no-go arguments become
irrelevant because there is no -matrix in the  space.
Also it explains why the HS gauge theory phase is not
directly observed in the  superstring theory  prior
its full formulation in the  background is found and
 fits the idea of the correspondence between
HS gauge theories in the bulk and the boundary conformal theories
.

In the context of  applications of the
HS gauge theory to the superstring theory () and
M theory (), it is important  to extend
the  results on the HS-gravitational interactions
to higher dimensions. The aim of this paper is to present
the full nonlinear formulation of the field equations for
totally symmetric bosonic HS fields in any dimension.
The form of the proposed equations  is analogous to that of
the  equations of.

Free higher spin gauge fields 
There are two equivalent approaches to description of
totally symmetric bosonic massless fields of all spins at the free
field level.
The approach developed by Fronsdal and de Wit and
Freedman is parallel to the metric formulation of
gravity.  Here an
integer spin  massless field is described by a totally
symmetric tensor  ()
subject to the double
tracelessness condition which is nontrivial
for . The free field Abelian HS gauge transformation is
 
where the parameter  is
a totally symmetric rank  traceless tensor,




A nonlocal version of the same theory with unrestricted
gauge parameters was developed in.

An alternative approach operates in terms of a 1-form frame-like
HS gauge field 
 which is traceless in the  fiber indices,
e_b ^ba_3a_s-1  =0.
(We use  underlined letters for  indices of vector fields and forms.)
The  Abelian HS gauge transformation law in the flat space-time is
e^a_1a_s-1   = d ^a_1a_s-1  
+ h_b^a_1a_s-1 ,b .
Here  is the flat
space frame field (i.e.,  in the Cartesian coordinates).
 is a totally symmetric traceless
gauge parameter equivalent to that of  Fronsdal's formulation.
The gauge parameter
 is also traceless and satisfies the
condition that the symmetrization over all its indices is zero
. It is a HS generalization of
the parameter of the local Lorentz transformations in gravity
() which is  .  The
Lorentz type ambiguity due to 
can be gauge fixed by requiring the
frame type HS gauge field to be totally symmetric
e_n a_2a_s  =_n a_2a_s ,
thus establishing equivalence with the Fronsdal's formulation.
Note that such defined  is automatically
double traceless as a consequence of ().

The Lorentz type HS symmetry with the parameter
 assumes a HS 1-form
connection .  From the analysis of
its transformation law it follows that, generically,
some new gauge connections and symmetry parameters have to be introduced.
As a result,
the full set of HS connections associated with a spin  massless
field consists of the 1-forms

which take values in  all irreducible
representations of the -dimensional massless Lorentz group
 described by the traceless Young tableaux with at most
two rows such that the upper row has length 

 


In other words, the  1-forms
  are
symmetric in the Lorentz vector indices
 and  separately and satisfy the relations



,



( From here it follows
that all other traces of the fiber indices are also zero.)
For the case  , the field 
identifies with the dynamical spin  frame type field
.

The formalism of works both in
 and in flat space. In 
it allows to build the free
HS actions in terms of manifestly gauge invariant linearized
(Abelian) field strengths. Explicit form of these linearized
curvatures provides the starting point towards determination
of non Abelian HS symmetries and HS curvatures.
For the case of  this programme was realized in
. Here we extend these results to the bosonic HS theory
in any dimension. To this end it is  convenient to use the
observation of that the
 collection of the HS  1-forms

with all  can be
interpreted as a result of the "dimensional reduction"
of a 1-form 
carrying the irreducible representation of   or 
 described by the traceless two-row
rectangular Young tableau of length 
^A_1 A_s-1 ,A_s B_2B_s-1    =0,^A_1 A_s-3 C  _C,  ^B_1B_s-1    =0.
Let us first recall how this approach works in the gravity case.
 dimensional gravity can be described
 by a 1-form connection  
of the  Lie algebra   .
The Lorentz subalgebra
  is identified  with the
stability subalgebra of some vector . Since
we are discussing local Lorentz symmetry, this vector can be chosen
differently in different points of space-time, thus becoming a
field  . The norm of this vector is convenient
to relate to the cosmological constant
 so that  has dimension of length
V^AV_A = -^-1 .
 is supposed to be negative and positive in
 the  and  cases, respectively (within the mostly minus
signature). This allows for a covariant definition of the
frame field and
Lorentz connection E^A = D(V^A) d V^A + ^AB V_B,^LAB  = ^AB  +( E^A V^B - E^B V^A ).
According to these definitions







When the  frame  has the maximal rank  it
gives rise to a nondegenerate metric tensor



The torsion 2-form is



The zero-torsion condition



expresses the Lorentz connection via
(derivatives of) the frame field in a usual manner. The
 transversal components of the curvature () 
identify with the Riemann tensor shifted by the term  bilinear in the
frame 1-form. As a result, any field  satisfying
the zero-curvature equation
r^AB = d_0^AB  + _0^A  _C _0^CB =0,
describes  space-time
with the cosmological term  provided that the metric
tensor is nondegenerate.

The Lorentz irreducible HS connections

are the -dimensional traceless parts of
those components of

which are parallel to  in   indices and transversal in
the rest ones. Let some solution of
() which describes the  background be fixed.
The linearized HS curvature  has the following
simple form
R_1^A_1 A_s-1 , B_1B_s-1    &=& D_0
(_1^A_1 A_s-1 , B_1B_s-1  ) =
d _1^A_1 A_s-1 , B_1B_s-1   

 & &+(s-1)(

+_0^B_1  _C _1^ A_1 A_s-1 , C B_2B_s-1   ).
It is manifestly invariant under the linearized  gauge transformations
 ^A_1 A_s-1 , B_1B_s-1   (x) =
D_0  ^A_1 A_s-1 , B_1B_s-1    (x)
because .
The  covariant form of the free HS action of

The coefficients
a (s,p) = a  (s) (-)^-(s-p-1) 
(d-5 +2 (s-p-2))!! (s-p-1)   (s-p-2)! 
are fixed by the condition that
the action is independent of all those components of
 for which
.
As a result of this condition, the free action
() depends only on the frame type
 dynamical HS field
  and the Lorentz connection type
auxiliary field  expressed
in terms of the first derivatives of  
  by virtue of
its equation of motion equivalent to the "zero torsion condition"
0= T_1  _A_1 A_s-1   R_1A_1 A_s-1    _,B_1B_s-1   V^B_1  V^B_s-1  .
Pluging  the expression for
 back into ()
gives rise to the free HS action expressed entirely
(modulo total derivatives) in terms
of  and its first derivatives.
Since the linearized curvatures ()
are invariant under the Abelian HS gauge
transformations (),
the resulting action has required
HS gauge symmetries and therefore describes
 the free field HS dynamics in .
In particular, the generalized Lorentz type transformations
with the gauge parameter ()
guarantee that only the totally symmetric part of the gauge
field  
equivalent to  contributes to the action.
Although this action is defined to be independent of the "extra fields"
 with ,
one has to express the extra fields in terms of
the dynamical HS fields because they contribute beyond the linearized
approximation.
The fields 
 with     express via
up to order  derivatives of the dynamical field by virtue of
certain constraints analogous to the zero torsion
condition in gravity. As a result, the condition that the free action
is independent of the extra fields is equivalent to the condition that
it does not contain higher derivatives.





 bosonic higher spin algebra 


 From the analysis of  section  it is clear that,
to reproduce  the correct set of HS gauge fields, one has to find such
an algebra  which  contains  or  
 as a subalgebra and decomposes under the adjoint action
of  in  into a sum of
irreducible finite-dimensional modules over 
 described by various two-row rectangular
traceless Young tableaux.
Such an algebra was described recently by Eastwood inas the algebra of conformal HS symmetries of
the free  masless Klein-Gordon equation in  dimensions.
Here we give a slightly different definition of this algebra
which is more suitable for the analysis of the HS interactions.


Consider oscillators  with  satisfying the
commutation relations
[Y_i^A , Y_j^B ]_* = _ij ^AB ,_ij = -
_ji ,_12 =1,
where   is the invariant symmetric  form of
. For example, one can interpret these
oscillators as conjugated coordinates and momenta ,
.
 and  will be used to raise and
lower indices in the usual manner


,


,




We use the Weyl (Moyal) star product
(f*g)(Y) =1 ^2(d+1)  
dS dT f(Y+S) g(Y+T)-2 S^A_i T_A^i.
, .
The associative algebra of polynomials
with the  product law generated via
() is called Weyl algebra . Its generic
element is


or, equivalently,
f(Y) = _m,n  f_A_1 A_m,B_1 B_n  Y_1 ^A_1 Y_1 ^A_m Y_2 ^B_1 Y_2 ^B_n 
with the coefficients 
symmetric in the indices  and .








Various bilinears built from the oscillators  form the
Lie algebra  with respect to star commutators. It contains
the subalgebra  spanned by the
mutually commuting generators
T^AB  = -T^BA  =Y^iA  Y^B_i,t_ij  =t_ji  = Y^A_i Y_jA   .
Consider the subalgebra
 spanned by the  singlets 
[t_ij  , f(Y) ]_* =0.
Eq.() is equivalent to




For the expansion ()  this condition implies
that the coefficients
 are nonzero
only if 
and that symmetrization over any  indices of
 gives zero, i.e. they
 have the symmetry properties of a two-row rectangular
Young tableau. As a result, the gauge fields of  are
(Yx) = _l=0 ^_A_1 A_l,B_1 B_l (x)
 Y_1 ^A_1 Y_1 ^A_l Y_2 ^B_1 Y_2 ^B_l 
with the component gauge fields 
 taking values in all two-row rectangular Young tableaux
of .

The algebra  is not simple.
It contains the two-sided ideal  spanned by the elements
of the form
g=t_ij *g^ij ,
where  transforms as a symmetric tensor with respect to
, i.e.,



.
(Note that 
.)
Actually, from () it follows that
 , .
  Due to the definition () of ,
the ideal  contains all traces
of the two-row Young tableaux. As a result, the algebra
 has only traceless two-row
tableaux in the expansion (). (Let us note that
this factorization is not optional because
some of the traces
of  two-row rectangular tableaux are not themselves
two-row rectangular tableaux and may not admit
a straightforward interpretation in terms of HS fields.)
The algebra   was identified by Eastwood inas conformal HS algebra in  dimensions.


For the complex algebra  we will use
notation .
Its real form corresponding to a unitary HS theory in the
 case of  will be called
 . The meaning of this notation is
as follows. According to,
 is the superalgebra of  matrices
whose elements are arbitrary even (odd) power polynomials
of  pairs of oscillators in the diagonal (off-diagonal)
blocks. Because of the  invariance condition (),
in our case only even functions of oscillators appear.  So we discard
the label  in the notation .
The label 

means that the appropriate
quotient of the centralizer in
 with respect to the  subalgebra, which
commutes with the   spanned by bilinears of
oscillators, is taken.  
is  the subalgebra of  .

Note that the described construction  of the HS algebra
is analogous to that of the  HS algebra given by
Sezgin and Sundell in  in terms of spinor oscillators with the symmetric 
charge conjugation matrix in place of the metric tensor in
(). Also let us note that the key role of
the algebra  in the analysis of HS dynamics explained below
is reminiscent of the role of  in the two-time
approach developed by Bars.  In,
the  invariant technics was applied to the description of
interacting massless fields. The important difference
 is that in our case the  invariance condition
acts in the fiber space described by polynomials of the auxiliary
variables , reducing the set of fields
appropriately, while the   algebra in the models ofacts  on the base.

Twisted adjoint representation and
 Central On-Mass-Shell theorem 

Now we are in a position to define the twisted adjoint
representation which describes  the
HS Weyl 0-forms.


Let a  HS algebra admit such an involutive automorphism 
(i.e., , ) that its action on the
elements of the  subalgebra is
(P^a ) = -P^a,(L^ab  ) = L^ab .
Once the Lorentz algebra is singled out by the compensator, the
automorphism  describes the reflection with respect to the
compensator vector. In particular, for the HS algebra under investigation
we set



where
A ^A = A^A -2 V^2 V^A V_B A^B .
for any  vector .
Let us introduce notations
A^A _i =  ^A^ A _i +  ^A^ A _i, ^A^ A _i =  1 V^2  V^A V_B A^B_i, ^A^ A _i =  A^A_i - 1 V^2  V^A V_B A^B_i.
We have  and
.
The action of  on a general element is
(f(Y )) = f  (Y) f (Y  ).
It is elementary to see that   is an
automorphism of the Weyl algebra.  Since ,
the same is true for the HS algebra. To simplify analysis we will
assume that   is -independent that requires
 to be  -independent.

Let  be  a 0-form in the HS algebra linear space, i.e.
 with the ideal  factored out.
The covariant derivative in the twisted adjoint representation is
D  (C)= d C + *C - C* ,
Central On-Mass-Shell theorem  formulated inin terms of Lorentz components of  states  that the
equations for totally symmetric free
massless fields in  can be formulated in the form
R_1 ( ^Y ,  ^Y ) = E_0^A E_0^B
^2 Y^A_i Y^B_j  _ij  C(0, ^Y),
D _0 (C) =0,
where






and  where
  satisfies () to describe
the   background.

The components of the expansion of the
0-forms  on the r.h.s.
of () in powers of 
are  transversal. These are the
HS Weyl 0-forms 
described by the traceless two-row rectangular Lorentz
Young diagrams of length . They  parametrize
those components of the HS field strengths that remain
nonvanishing when the field equations and constraints on extra fields
are satisfied. For example, the Weyl tensor in gravity ()
parametrizes the components of the Riemann tensor
allowed to be nonvanishing when  the zero-torsion
constraint and Einstein equations (requiring the Ricci tensor to
vanish) are imposed. The equation () describes the
consistency conditions for the HS equations and also dynamical
equations for spins 0 and 1. (Dynamics of a massless scalar
was described this way in.)
In addition they
express an infinite set of auxiliary fields  contained
in  in terms of derivatives of the dynamical HS fields.

The key fact is that the equations () and ()
are consistent, i.e., the apllication of the covariant
derivative to the l.h.s. of () and ()
does not lead to new conditions. The only nontrivial point is to
check that
 _ij  D_0 (  E_0^A E_0^B
^2 Y^A_i Y^B_j   C(0, ^Y) )=0
as a consequence of ().  It is convenient to
use the following forms of the covariant derivatives in the adjoint and
twisted adjoint representations
D_0 = D^L_0 -E^A_0 V^B (  ^Y_Ai 
  ^Y^ B _i  -
 ^Y_Bi   ^Y^A_i  ),
D _0 = D_0^L - 2E_0^A V^B (  ^Y_A ^i  ^Y_Bi  -
1 4 ^ji 
   ^Y^ A j  ^Y^Bi    ),
where the Lorentz covariant derivative is





One observes that  commutes with
 
. As a result, it remains to check
the frame dependent terms. These all vanish
either because the r.h.s. of () is
-independent or because of  the identity




valid as a consequence of the total antisymmetrization over
the indices   and 
which take two values  (equivalently, because the 
does not contain  Young tableaux with more than two rows).

The adjoint covariant derivative () and twisted adjoint
covariant derivative ()
commute with the operators  and  , respectively,
N^ad = Y^A_i Y^A_i ,N^tw =  ^Y^A_i  ^Y^A_i -
 ^Y^A_i  ^Y^A_i .
This means that the free field equations () and
() decompose into independent subsystems
for the sets of fields satisfying
N^ad  = 2(s-1) , N^tw  C = 2s C, s 0.
(Note that the operator  does not have negative eigenvalues
when acting on tensors with the symmetry property of
a two-row rectangular Young tableau because
having more than a half of vector indices
aligned along   would imply symmetrization
over more than a half of indices,
thus giving zero.)

The set of fields
singled out by () describes a massless spin .
As expected, the massless scalar field is described  only in terms of
the 0-form , having no associated gauge field. In terms of
Lorentz irreducible components, the spin  gauge connections take
values in
the representations () with various  while
the spin  Weyl tensors take values in the Lorentz representations
  with various . (Note that the missed cells
 compared to the rectangular diagram of the length
of the upper row correspond to the Lorentz
invariant direction along .) We see that  the
twisted adjoint action of the  algebra on the HS algebra
decomposes into an infinite set of infinite-dimensional submodules
associated with different spins, while its adjoint action
decomposes into an infinite set of finite-dimensional submodules.
This fits the fact (see e.g.), that the space of
physical states is described by
the  0-form  sector  which therefore has to form an infinite module
over a space-time symmetry for
any dynamical system with infinite number of degrees of freedom.



Nonlinear Equations 

Following to the
 standard approach in HS theorywe will  look for a nonlinear deformation of the free field
equations () and () in the form of a free
differential algebra

satisfying the consistency condition

where  describes all dynamical variables in the system (i.e.
all 1-forms  and 0-forms  in our case).
The equations () and ()
acquire nonlinear corrections once the fields
 and  are interpeted, respectively,
as the vacuum and fluctuational parts
of some dynamical field. In this case
one has to replace the background covariant derivatives by the
full ones that gives rise to nontrivial Bianchi relations because
 is proportional to
the generalized Weyl tensors (in particular, to the
usual Weyl tensor in the spin 2 sector).
As shown in the
key principle that fixes a form of the  nonlinear
field equations found in is the condition
that the local Lorentz symmetry remains a proper subgroup  of the
infinite-dimensional HS algebra. This requirement
 guarantees that the nonlinear theory can be  interpretated
in terms of usual (finite-component) tensor fields. Otherwise,
a deformation of the algebra might affect the form of the
commutator of the Lorentz generators which may get admixture of
infinity of HS generators with field-dependent coefficients.
The same principle was used for the derivation of  equations
.
The observation that allows us to
build bosonic HS equations in any  is that in this case one has
to require the  algebra, which singles out the
HS algebra spanned by two-row rectangular tensor elements, to
remain undeformed at the nonlinear level. Otherwise,
the condition () would not allow a
meaningful extension beyond the free field level, i.e., the resulting
system may admit no interpretation in terms of the original HS
tensor fields described by two-row rectangular Young tableaux,
allowing, for example, nonlinear corrections in
sectors of tensors which are absent at the linearized level.


The formulation of nonlinear HS equations in any dimension
is nearly identical to that
of  and   HS field equations given inin terms of spinors.  First,  we double a number of oscillators
. The space of functions  is endowed
with the star product
(f*g)(Z,Y) =1 ^2(d+1)  
dS dT f(Z+S,Y+S) g(Z-T, Y+T)
-2 S^A_i T_A^i ,
which is associative, normalized so that  and
gives rise to the  commutation relations
[Y_i^A , Y_j^B ]_* = _ij ^AB ,[Z_i^A , Z_j^B ]_* = - _ij ^AB , [Y_i^A , Z_j^B ]_* =0.
The star product () describes a
normal-ordered basis in  with respect to creation
and annihilation operators  and , respectively.
For  independent elements () coincides with ().
The following  useful formulae are true
Y^A_i * = Y^A_i + (  Y_A^i - Z_A^i )
 ,Z^A_i * =
Z^A_i + (  Y_A^i - Z_A^i )
 ,
* Y^A_i  = Y^A_i - (  Y_A^i + Z_A^i ),
* Z^A_i  = Z^A_i + ( Y_A^i + Z_A^i ).
Important property of the star product () is that it
admits inner Klein operators. Indeed, it is elementary to see
with the aid of () that the element
K  = -2z_i y^i   ,
where
y_i = 1 V^2   V_B Y^B_i,z_i = 1 V^2   V_B Z^B_i
has the  properties
K  *f = f *  K ,K  *K =1,
where  .
This follows from the following formulae
K  *f = -2z_i y^i  
f(Z^A_i - 1 V^2  V^A V_B (Z^B_i -Y^B_i ),
Y^A_i + 1 V^2  V^A V_B (Z^B_i -Y^B_i )),
f* K   = -2z_i y^i  
f(Z^A_i - 1 V^2  V^A V_B (Z^B_i +Y^B_i ),
Y^A_i - 1 V^2  V^A V_B (Z^B_i +Y^B_i )).
We introduce the fields ,  and   ,
where  is a 0-form while  and  are
connection 1-forms in space-time and auxiliary  directions,
respectively
W(Z,Yx)=dx^W_(Z,Yx),S(Z,Yx)=dZ^A_i S^i_A (Z,Yx).
The fields  and  are identified with the "initial data"
for the evolution in  variables
(Yx) = W(0,Yx),C (Yx) = B(0,Yx).
The  - connection  will be determined modulo gauge ambiguity in terms
of .  The differentials satisfy the standard anticommutation
relations









and commute to all other variables.


The full nonlinear system of HS equations is
dW+W*W =0,
dS+W*S+ S*W =0 ,
dB+W*B-B*W  =0,
S*B = B*S ,
S*S = -( dZ^A_i dZ_A^i  + 4^-1  dz_i dz^i  B*),
where 
and .
In terms of  a noncommutative connection



 the system ()-()
reads
*=  -( dZ^A_i dZ_A^i  + 4^-1   dz_i dz^i  B*),* B = B * .
We see that    is
the only nonzero component of the  curvature.
Note that  has dimension  to match the
Central On-Mas-Shell theorem () upon identification
of  with  in the lowest order. So,
 is dimensionless. Since the  dependent
part of the equation () is responsible for interactions,
this indicates that taking the flat limit
may be difficult in the interacting theory if there is no other
contributions to the cosmological constant  due to some
condensates which break  the HS gauge symmetries.

The system is formally consistent in the sense that the associativity
relations  and ,
equivalent to Bianchi identities,
are respected by the equations  ()-().
The only nontrivial part of this property might be that for the
relationship  in the sector of  due to the
second term on the r.h.s. of () since
 commutes with everything except   to which it
anticommutes. However, this does not break the consistency of the system
because .
As a result, the equations ()-() are consistent
as "differential"
 equations with respect to  and  variables.
A related statement is that the equations ()-()
are invariant under the gauge transformations
= [, ]_* ,B = * B -
B* 
with an arbitrary gauge parameter .






Let us show that the condition () admits a proper deformation
to the full nonlinear theory, i.e. that
there is a proper deformation
 of   that allows us to impose the
conditions
D(t^int _ij )=0, [S, t^int _ij ]_*=0,B * t ^int _ij  - t^int _ij  *B =0,
which amount to the original conditions 
 in the free field limit. Indeed, let us introduce
the  generators of the diagonal 
algebra
t^tot _ij  =  Y^A_i Y_Aj   - Z^A_i Z_jA   .
 In any  covariant gauge (in which 
is expressed in terms of  with no external 
noninvariant parameters - see below)
 acts on  as



provided that  is a  singlet.

Setting , the equation () gets the form



 From () and () it follows  that
S^i_A *B*= B**( S^i_A - 2 V^2 V^A V^B S^i_B ).
As a result, we get
[s^i , s^j ]_* = -^ij  (1 + 4^-1  B*),s^i *B*= - B**s^i,s^i =  1 V^2  V^A S^i_A 
and ,
.
The commutation relations () have a form of the
deformed oscillator algebraoriginally found by Wigner in in a particular representation.
Its key property is that the operators



form  and




As a result,  the operators
t^int _ij =t^tot _ij -_ij 
form   and commute with .
The conditions
() are equivalent to the usual  invariance conditions
for the fields  and  and are identically satisfied
 on , which essentially means that nonlinear corrections
due to the evolution along -directions in the noncommutative space
do not affect .
In the free field limit with ,  coincides
with ().
One uses   in the nonlinear
model the same way as   () in the
free one to impose () and to factor out
the respective ideal .
This guarantees that the nonlinear field
equations described by Eqs.()-()
and () make sense for the
HS fields associated with  .




Perturbative analysis 

The perturbative analysis of the equations ()-()
is analogous to that carried out in
spinor notations in for the 
case. Let us set
W=W_0 +W_1 ,S= S_0 +S_1 ,B=B_0 +B_1
with the vacuum solution
B_0 = 0 ,S_0 = dZ^A_i Z_A^i ,W_0 =  _0^AB  (x)  Y^i_A Y_iB ,
where  satisfies the zero curvature conditions to describe
.  From () and () we get
B_1 = C(Yx).
Let us consider the equation ().
 First of all we observe that using
the gauge ambiguity ()
 we can set all components of 
equal to zero, i.e. to set



The leftover gauge symmetry parameters are  
independent.
The equations () and () then require
the fields  and  also to be  independent.
So, the dependence on  now enters only through .
As a result, () amounts to the first equation in ().
With the help of () one obtains in the first order
^i s^j_1 - ^j  s^i_1
=-4^-1  ^ij 
C(- ^Z, ^Y)-2 z_k y^k  ,
where 
The generic solution of this equation is
s^j_1 =^j  _1 +2^-1  z^j
^1_0dtt
C(-t ^Z, ^Y )-2t z_i y^i  .
The ambiguity in the function 
manifests invariance under the gauge transformations
().
It is convenient to fix a gauge by requiring 
 in (). (This  gauge is a covariant because
it  involves no external parameters carrying nontrivial
representations of .)
This gauge fixing is not complete as
it does not fix the gauge transformations with  independent parameters
 _1 (Z,Yx)=_1 (Yx) .
 As a result, the field  is
expressed in terms of .  It is not surprising
of course that the noncommutative gauge connection  is
reconstructed in terms of the noncommutative curvature 
modulo gauge transformations.
The leftover gauge transformations
with the
parameter () identify with the HS gauge transformations
acting on the  physical HS fields.


Now, let us analyze the  equation ().
In the first order, one gets
^i W_1 = d s^i_1 +W_0 * s^i_1 -  s^i_1 *W_0  .
Using  that generic solution of the equation



has the form



provided that
 
 and  one finds
W_1(Z,Y)=(Y) -Z^j_A V^A
 ^1_0 dt(1-t)e^-2tz_i y^i 
   E^B Y^jB   C(-t ^Z, Y^)
(note that the terms with 
  vanish because ). Since, perturbatively,
the system as a whole is  a consistent
 system of differential equations with respect to 
  and 
it is enough to analyze
the equations () and () at .
Thus, to derive dynamical HS equations,
it remains to insert () into () and ()
into (),
interpreting  and   as generating
functions for the HS fields. The elementary analysis of
() at  with the help of () and ()
gives ().
For , the equation  ()
amounts to  () in the lowest order.
Thus it is shown that the linearized part of the HS equations
()-() reproduses the Central On-Mass-Shell theorem
for symmetric massless fields.
The system ()-() allows one to
derive systematically all higher-order corrections to the free
equations.








Discussion 

The system of
gauge invariant  nonlinear dynamical equations  for totally symmetric
massless fields of all spins in 
presented in this paper can be  generalized to a class of models with
the  Yang-Mills groups ,  or .
This results from the observation that, analogously to the case of 
, the system ()-() remains consistent
for matrix valued  fields
,  and ,
.
Upon imposing the reality conditions
W^(Z,Yx)= - W^(-iZ,iYx),S^(Z,Yx)= - S^(-iZ,iYx),
B^(Z,Yx)= - B ^(-iZ,iYx)
this gives rise to a system with the global HS symmetry algebra
. Here all fields, including the spin 1
fields which correspond  to
the -independent part of , take values in
 which is the Yang-Mills algebra of the theory.

Combining the
antiautomorphism of the star product algebra
 with some antiautomorphism of the matrix
algebra generated by a nondegenerate form 
one can impose the conditions
W_ ^(Z,Yx)=
- ^ _  W_ ^(-iZ,iYx),S_ ^(Z,Yx)=
- ^ _  S_ ^(-iZ,iYx),
B_ ^(Z,Yx)=
- ^ _  B _ ^(-iZ,iYx),
which
truncate the original system to the one with the Yang-Mills
gauge group  or  depending on whether the form
 is antisymmetric or symmetric, respectively.
The corresponding global HS symmetry algebras are called
 and ,
respectively.
In this case  all fields of odd spins take values in the
adjoint representation of the
Yang-Mills group while fields of even spins take values in the opposite
symmetry second rank representation (i.e., symmetric for
  and antisymmetric for
 ) which contains singlet. The graviton
is always the singlet spin 2 particle in the theory.
Color spin 2 particles are also included for general 
however.(Let us note that this does not
contradict to the no-go results of because
the theory under consideration
does not allow a flat limit with  unbroken
HS symmetries and color spin 2 symmetries.)  The
minimal HS theory is  based on the algebra .
It describes  even spin particles, each in one copy. (Odd spins
do not appear because the adjoint representation of  is trivial.)

All HS models have essentially one
dimensionless coupling constant , the Yang-Mills  coupling constant.
At the level of field equations it can be rescaled away by a field
redefinition. The relationship with the
  gravitational
constant is . Unlikely to the
 case of,
for general   we do not see a  way for a consistent nontrivial
modification of the system  ()-()  that cannot
be compensated by a  field redefinition.
This  probably means that the interaction
ambiguity in one function
found in is due to the possibility to treat
independently the selfdual and anti-selfdual parts of the HS curvatures,
that makes no sense for totally symmetric fields beyond .


The results of this paper  indicate that there
may exist a large class of consistent HS theories in  
with different spin spectra.
An important problem for the future is therefore
to extend the obtained results
beyond the class of totally symmetric gauge fields. A formulation
of arbitrary symmetry free massless fields in the flat space-time
is fairly well understood by now
(see e.g.,). The general covariant
formulation in 
is still lacking however, athough a number of important contributions
has been made.
In particular, the light cone formulation of
the equations of motion of generic massless fields in 
 and actions for generic massless
fields in  were constructed by Metsaev.
In an
approach to covariant description of an arbitrary representation
of  algebra  was developed in the framework of the
radial reduction technique. The unfolded formulation
of a  HS theory with mixed symmetry fields was studied in
 in the sector of  Weyl 0-forms.
The phenomenon of partial masslessness of HS fields in 
is another specificity of the dynamics in  .
Extension of flat space results
to  is not  straightforward for mixed symmetry
fields because  irreducible
massless systems in  reduce in the flat limit to a collection
of independent flat space massless fields.
