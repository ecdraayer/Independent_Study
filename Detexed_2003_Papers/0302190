  Abstract 

 
 
We investigate the correspondence between the
D2-brane, which is described by the abelian Born-Infeld action, 
and multiple D0-branes,
which are done by the nonabelian Born-Infeld action.
We construct effective actions for the fuzzy cylinder,
sphere and plane formed via D0-branes
and compare these actions with those for the cylindrical, 
spherical and planar D2-brane. We show that in the continuous limit,
the effective actions for the fuzzy D0-branes 
precisely coincide with those for the single D2-brane 
if both the fuzziness of the D0-brane and the area occupied per a
unit of magnetic flux on the D2-brane are equal to .








Introduction  


It is well-known that multiple D0-branes form a fuzzy sphere
in the background of some constant Ramond-Ramond 4-form field 
strength. This is what is called the Myers effect.
One of the interesting features of this effect is that the fuzzy sphere
carries the dielectric charge for the R-R 3-form potential.
This means that the fuzzy sphere is actually a bound state
of a D2-brane and D0-branes, and implies that the D2-brane can 
be constructed from multiple D0-branes.

Let us observe the Myers effect in detail.
We consider the case where the fuzzy sphere is formed via  D0-branes.
By evaluating the nonabelian Born-Infeld action and
Chern-Simons action for  D0-branes, we obtain the potential energy
for the fuzzy sphere like
 3 
  V_D 0  &= (MT_0)^2 + (4r^2 T_2)^2(1-1 M^2 )  
  - 16hT_2 r^3 3  (1 - 1 M^2 ), where  is the constant R-R 4-form field strength and the
parameter  represents a radius of the fuzzy sphere.
 is the mass of the D0-brane and  is the tension of the D2-brane.
If we take the limit that  is large and  is sufficiently small, 
we can expand the Born-Infeld part of the above potential energy
and find a local minimum near , where  is defined as
 and  is the string length.
Note that the Chern-Simons part of the potential energy
can be approximated as . 
This means that the fuzzy sphere carries the dielectric charge 
for the R-R 3-form potential.

On the other hand, the same dielectric phenomenon can also be confirmed
by analyzing the abelian Born-Infeld action and Chern-Simons action
for a spherical D2-brane.
The potential energy for the spherical D2-brane with
 units of magnetic flux on its world-volume is evaluated as
 3 
  V_D 2  &= (MT_0)^2 + (4r^2 T_2)^2  
  - 16hT_2 r^3 3 . It is easy to see that the potential energy () approaches 
to the energy () as  goes sufficiently large.
Thus the dielectric phenomenon can be viewed from two different ways, 
that is, as the classical configurations of multiple D0-branes which form
the fuzzy sphere or as the classical configuration of the spherical D2-brane 
with magnetic flux on its world-volume.

So far we have observed that the system of the spherical D2-brane
with magnetic flux on the world-volume is realized as the classical 
fuzzy configurations of D0-branes. Now it is natural to pose a question 
whether an effective action for the spherical D2-brane with magnetic flux is 
constructed from the multiple D0-branes which form the fuzzy sphere 
by adding some fluctuations around it.
Especially it is easy to show that the world-volume 
theory on the spherical D2-brane is described by  gauge theory.
So the fluctuations around the fuzzy sphere must also be described by 
 gauge theory if the fuzzy sphere precisely corresponds to the 
spherical D2-brane with magnetic flux in the continuous, or large , limit.

In this paper we analyze the nonabelian Born-Infeld action for D0-branes 
around the backgrounds of the fuzzy cylinder, sphere and 
plane(For the plane case, see also refs. and.) .
And we show that fluctuations around these fuzzy backgrounds 
are certainly described by  gauge theories. Furthermore we see that 
these effective actions precisely coincide with the actions obtained by 
evaluating the abelian Born-Infeld action for the D2-brane if both
the fuzziness of the D0-brane and the area occupied per a unit of magnetic 
flux on the D2-brane are equal to .

It should be mentioned that in this paper we consider the cylindrical
and spherical D2-brane, or the fuzzy cylinder and sphere
formed via D0-branes, in the background of the flat space-time.
These configurations are unstable against the collapse because of the 
D2-brane tension, however,
in any case it is possible to stabilize those configurations 
by introducing some nontrivial background R-R flux, as in the case
of the Myers effect. Since the effects of the background R-R flux appears
through the Chern-Simons action, for the analyses of the Born-Infeld action,
it does not matter whether the background R-R flux exists or not.

The contents of this paper are as follows.
In section 2, we give some comments on properties of the fuzzy cylinder,
sphere and plane by explicitly representing matrices.
In section 3, we obtain the effective actions for the cylindrical, spherical
and planar D2-brane by evaluating the abelian Born-Infeld action.
In section 4, we construct the effective actions for the fuzzy cylinder,
sphere and plane, and compare these actions with the results obtained 
in the section 3. Some discussions are given in section 5.




Some Comments on Fuzzy Surfaces with Axial Symmetry  



In this section we review various fuzzy surfaces which are
embedded in the three dimensional flat space .
First we consider a fuzzy cylinder extending to the  direction 
and generalize this to a fuzzy surface with axial symmetry around
the  direction. Then we discuss a fuzzy sphere and plane in order.

The fuzzy surface is represented by a set of 
three hermitian matrices (, , ). 
If these three matrices are simultaneously diagonalized, 
each set of diagonal elements  
is interpreted as a position in the space . 
Note that these matrices describe just a set of 'points' 
and do not represent a 'surface'. In order to construct 
a 'surface' from matrices, the commutation relations among 
,  and  must be nontrivial, as we will see later.

It is useful to remark that the size of matrices is finite for 
a closed fuzzy surface and infinite for an open one. 
This is because the size of matrices is related to the area of 
the fuzzy surface. The closed fuzzy surface can be approximated as a smooth one
if the size of matrices is large enough. 
Similarly the open fuzzy surface can be approximated 
as a smooth one if the size of partial matrices
assigned to some finite area is sufficiently large.




The fuzzy cylinder 




First of all let us investigate the fuzzy cylinder as a simple example
of the fuzzy surfaces which are axially symmetric around the  
direction.
In order to find an explicit representation of matrices for the fuzzy cylinder,
it is useful to note that the smooth cylinder which is extending to the 
 direction is algebraically expressed as
 3 
  -< x^3 < ,   (x^1)^2 + (x^2)^2 = _c^2 . Here the constant  is the radius of the smooth cylinder 
(see Fig.(a)).

Let us consider matrix versions of the above equations.
First we diagonalize the hermitian matrix  and interpret each element
as a position in the  direction.
Then the first condition in () can be translated into 
the condition that the diagonal elements 
increase from  to  as the subscripts  do. 
Here the subscripts  run the whole integer and 
this means that the size of the matrices is infinite.
As mentioned before, this reflects the fact that the cylinder is 
the open surface. Next, by simply replacing variables with matrices 
in the second equation of (), we obtain the matrix equation
of the form
 3 
(X^1)^2 + (X^2)^2 = _c^2 1 _ , where  is the  unit matrix.

Now it is easy to see that the above two conditions for the matrices
,  and  are satisfied if we choose the matrices as
 3 
  X^1_mn  &= 1 2  _c _m+1,n  
  + 1 2  _c _m,n+1  ,  

  X^2_mn  &= i 2  _c _m+1,n  
  - i 2  _c _m,n+1  ,   

  X^3_mn  &= ml_c _m,n  , where . 
We will call the fuzzy element which is located at
 the th segment.
The above matrices are constructed so that
the segments are aligned to the  direction
with the constant separation . It is interesting to notice that
these matrices satisfy the simple algebra of the form
 3 
  [X^1,X^2] = 0, [X^2,X^3] = il_c X^1, [X^3,X^1] = il_c X^2. 
  This algebra contains only one parameter 
and the radius  appears from the Casimir operator. 


 
   
  
  (a) The smooth cylinder. (b) The fuzzy cylinder. Each segment
  occupies the constant area  
  and adjacent segments are joined without overlap. 
  
So far we have obtained the matrices () by referring to
the smooth cylinder. However the equation () is not
so strong to determine the representation of matrices uniquely.
For example, it is possible to choose other matrices which 
satisfy () as
 3 
  X^1_mn  &= 1 2  _c _m+k,n  
  + 1 2  _c _m,n+k  ,  

  X^2_mn  &= i 2  _c _m+k,n  
  - i 2  _c _m,n+k  ,   

  X^3_mn  &= m k l_c _m,n  , where  and  is an arbitrary positive integer. 
The matrices () are also included as a case of . 
Note that the above matrices satisfy the algebra ()
regardless of the value of .

Then in order to fix the matrix representation for the fuzzy cylinder,
we introduce the notion of the area for the fuzzy surface. 
As we will confirm later, 
the area  for the fuzzy surface with axial symmetry is defined as
 3 
  A = 2 Tr  (  -1 2  [X^i,X^j]^2   ) ,
  where  and  and  are contracted respectively. 
It is important to remark that the area for the fuzzy surface becomes
nonzero only when the commutation relations for the matrices  
are nontrivial. In other words, the matrices  which are simultaneously
diagonalized represent just a set of points and do not make any surface.
The factor  in the area formula will be explained later.

Now by substituting the matrices () for the 
formula (), the area can be estimated as 
, which means that the each segment 
occupies the constant area .
From this we see that adjacent segments are joined without any overlap 
only when  (see Fig.(b)).
Therefore we conclude that the matrices () really 
represent the fuzzy cylinder.

For later use we define  which 
represents the fuzziness of the each matrix diagonal element.




The fuzzy surface with axial symmetry 




In this subsection we generalize the previous arguments to obtain
the matrix representation for a fuzzy surface which has axial symmetry
around the  direction.
In order to execute this, let us gaze at the picture of the fuzzy cylinder,
Fig.(b). There the each value  
which appears in the elements 
or  is translated into a position in the radial direction
of the each joint between the th and th segments,
and the value  is done into a position of the each segment 
in the  direction. 
Now it is straightforward to generalize that the fuzzy surface with 
axial symmetry around the  direction is represented as
 3 
  X^1_mn  &= 1 2  _m+1/2  _m+1,n  
  + 1 2  _m-1/2  _m,n+1  ,  

  X^2_mn  &= i 2  _m+1/2  _m+1,n  
  - i 2  _m-1/2  _m,n+1  ,   

  X^3_mn  &= z_m _m,n  , where  run an infinite set of integers for the open surface and a finite
set of integers for the closed surface. As is obvious from the explanations
fo far,  is interpreted as a position of the th segment
in the  direction, and  is done as a position of 
the joint between the th and th segments 
in the radial direction (see Fig.). 

It is easy to see that the commutation relations among  are evaluated as
 3 
  [X^1,X^2]_mn  &= - i 2  ( _m+1/2 ^2 - 
  _m-1/2 ^2 ) _m,n ,   

  [X^2,X^3]_mn  &= i 2  _m+1/2  ( z_m+1  - z_m ) 
  _m+1,n  
  + i 2  _m-1/2  ( z_m  - z_m-1  ) _m,n+1  ,
    

  [X^3,X^1]_mn  &= - 1 2  _m+1/2  ( z_m+1  - z_m ) 
  _m+1,n  
  + 1 2  _m-1/2  ( z_m  - z_m-1  ) _m,n+1  . 
  Of course, the algebra for the fuzzy cylinder () 
is reproduced by choosing like
 and  for any .
The commutation relations will become
simple if the differences  are some constant.


 
   
  
  The general fuzzy surface with axial symmetry 
  is obtained by deforming the fuzzy cylinder. 
  
Let ua apply the area formula () to the fuzzy surface
with axial symmetry.
By substituting the matrices () for the formula, 
we obtain the area for the fuzzy surface as
 3 
  A &= 2_m  1 2   _m+1/2 ^2 
  ( z_m+1  - z_m )^2 + _m-1/2 ^2 
  ( z_m  - z_m-1  )^2 
  + 1 4  ( _m+1/2 ^2 
  - _m-1/2 ^2 )^2  . Now we take the continuous limit by assuming that the
differences  are sufficiently small.
In this case the set of  becomes a continuous parameter  and
the set of  is written as a function  as . 
Then the first term in the square root is approximated as 
and the second term is done as ,
where  is an abbreviation for . 
Furthermore the sum is replaced with the integral on .
After all in the continuous limit, the area formula for the fuzzy surface
() reaches to the form
 3 
  A &2dz   1 +   . This is precisely coincident with the area for the smooth surface with 
axial symmetry around the  direction. 
Therefore we conclude that the area formula () 
really gives the area for the fuzzy surface with axial symmetry.
Note that the factor  in the area formula corresponds to 
an integral over the angular direction and this does not arise 
from the trace operation.

Let us investigate the axial symmetry of the fuzzy surface 
in detail. After we rotate the matrices () around 
the  axis with an angle , we obtain 
matrices  of the forms,
 3 
  X ^1_mn  &= (X^1 - X^2)_mn  =
  1 2  _m+1/2  e^-i  
  _m+1,n  + 1 2  _m-1/2  e^i 
  _m,n+1  ,  

  X ^2_mn  &= (X^1 + X^2)_mn  =
  i 2  _m+1/2  e^-i  
  _m+1,n  - i 2  _m-1/2  e^i  
  _m,n+1  , 
  

  X ^3_mn  &= X^3_mn  = z_m _m,n  . It is easy to observe that the matrices
 and  hold the three conditions that
,  
and . This means that the matrices  and  represent 
the same fuzzy surface with axial symmetry. The parameter  
corresponds to the 'relative' angular direction as we see below.

Furthermore it is important to note that the above global rotation symmetry
around the  direction can be elevated to a 'local' symmetry as
 3 
  X ^1_mn  &= 1 2  _m+1/2  e^-i_m+1/2   
  _m+1,n  + 1 2  _m-1/2  e^i_m-1/2   
  _m,n+1  ,  

  X ^2_mn  &= i 2  _m+1/2  e^-i_m+1/2   
  _m+1,n  - i 2  _m-1/2  e^i_m-1/2   
  _m,n+1  ,   

  X ^3_mn  &= z_m _m,n  , where each  is a real parameter.
It is straightforward to show that these matrices  
represent the same fuzzy surface as the matrices .
If we explain pictorially,
the matrices  can be obtained from the matrices  by
rotating the th segment with the angle  where
. 

Note that the matrices () 
are also expressed by using a unitary matrix  as
 3 
  X ^i &= U X^i U^  ,  U_mn  = e^i_m   _m,n ,
where  are the same as the above.
This implies that the local rotation symmetry around the  axis
is identified with  symmetry.




The fuzzy sphere 




In this subsection we give self-contained derivation of the matrices 
which represent the fuzzy sphere. Since the fuzzy sphere is axially
symmetric around the  direction, we start from the matrices 
() and impose the following three conditions.

First, since the smooth sphere with the radius  is algebraically expressed as
 3 
  (x^1)^2 + (x^2)^2 + (x^3)^2 = c^2,
we impose the condition of the form,
 3 
  (X^1)^2 + (X^2)^2 + (X^3)^2 = c^2 1 _M , where  is the  unit matrix.
Note that the size of matrices is finite because the sphere 
is the closed surface. In components, the above condition is written as
 for 
 and .
Second we require that the each segment of the fuzzy sphere 
occupies the constant area . 
By referring the area formula (), 
this condition is expressed as
 3 
   1 2   _m+1/2 ^2 
  ( z_m+1  - z_m )^2 + _m-1/2 ^2 
  ( z_m  - z_m-1  )^2 
  + 1 4  ( _m+1/2 ^2 
  - _m-1/2 ^2 )^2   = a, where . 
Note that in the continuous limit the above equation becomes
 3 
  1+= c dz = a,
for .
This means that the each separation  between the adjacent segments
is some constant. Then the third condition for the fuzzy sphere is given by
 3 
  z_m = r_s M (2m-M-1). In the continuous limit, the set of  becomes
a parameter which range from  to , and  is thought 
the radius of the sphere.

Let us find out the explicit expressions for  which 
satisfy the conditions (), () 
and (). From these we obtain the recurrence relations
 3 
  4a^2 + (2r_s M )^4 - 4(2r_s M )^2
  _m+1/2 ^2  &= 4a^2 + (2r_s M )^4 
  - 4(2r_s M )^2 _m-1/2 ^2  
  2(2r_s M )^2.
The sign  is for  and
the sign  is for  since
the condition () insists that  increase
when  and decrease when .
Then by noting the relations  and 
, the above recurrence relations 
can be solved as
 3 
  _m+1/2  = 2r_s M  m(M-m)  ,
and simultaneously  and  are also determined as
 3 
  2a = 4r_s^2 M  1-1 M^2   ,  c= r_s 1-1 M^2  .
It is important to note that  and  become 
and  respectively in the continuous limit. 
These facts convince us that what we obtained so far precisely describes
the fuzzy sphere (see Fig.(a)).

Finally the matrices for the fuzzy sphere are written as
 3 
  X^1_mn  &= r_s M  m(M-m)  _m+1,n  
  + r_s M  (m-1)(M-m+1)  _m,n+1 
  ,  

  X^2_mn  &= ir_s M  m(M-m)  _m+1,n  
  - ir_s M  (m-1)(M-m+1)  _m,n+1  
  ,   

  X^3_mn  &= r_s M  (2m-M-1) _m,n  , where .
And the algebra for the fuzzy sphere is given by
 3 
  [X^i,X^j] = i^ijk  2r_s M  X^k ,
where  and  is contracted.

The fuzzy plane 




In this subsection we find out the matrices which represent the fuzzy plane.
Since the fuzzy plane has axial symmetry around the  direction, 
we start from the matrices () and impose the following
two conditions. 

The first one is given by
 3 
  X^3_mn  = z_0 _m,n , where  is some constant and . 
The size of matrices is infinite because the fuzzy plane is the open surface.
The above condition means that the fuzzy plane is
located at  in the  direction.
The second condition is given by
 3 
  1 2  (_m+1/2 ^2 
  - _m-1/2 ^2) = a, with .
This comes from the requirement that the each segment of the fuzzy
plane occupies the constant area .
It is easy to see that the above recurrence relations can
be solved as  (see Fig.(b)).

Then the matrices for the fuzzy plane are represented as
 3 
  X^1_mn  &= 1 2  2am  _m+1,n  
  + 1 2  2a(m-1)  _m,n+1  ,  

  X^2_mn  &= i 2  2am  _m+1,n  
  - i 2  2a(m-1)  _m,n+1  ,   

  X^3_mn  &= z_0 _m,n  , where . And the algebra for the fuzzy plane is given by
 3 
  [X^1,X^2] = -ia , [X^2,X^3] = [X^3,X^1] = 0.

Finally it is important to note that the area formula for the fuzzy 
plane becomes
 3 
  A = 2_m a = 2_m _m l_m 2d,
where  and  are defined as 
 and 
 respectively.
The notation  is used to represent the continuous limit.
The above equation precisely represents the area for the smooth plane.
It is also interesting to note that the above equation is also be expressed as
 3 
  A = 2i Tr  [X^1,X^2] 2d.
This relation is often used to show that the D2-brane charge can
be constructed from multiple D0-branes.




Effective Actions for the Single D2-brane with Axial Symmetry  




Preliminaries 




It is well-known that the bosonic part of the effective action 
for a single D2-brane is described by the abelian Born-Infeld action.
In this section 
we explicitly construct the effective actions for the cylindrical, spherical
and planar D2-brane in the background of the flat space-time.

The abelian Born-Infeld action in the background of the flat space-time 
is given by
 3 
  S_D 2  &= - T_2 d^3-(P[]_ 
  + F_  )  , where  is the tension of the D2-brane
and  and  are the string length and the string coupling constant
respectively. And the flat space-time metric is denoted as 
where .
The world-volume coordinates are represented by
 and .
Other conventions will be explained later.

The procedures to obtain the effective actions are straightforward, but
we execute without any omission since the results obtained in this section 
will play an important role to justify those obtained in the next section.




The effective action for the cylindrical D2-brane 




Let us describe the effective action for the cylindrical D2-brane.
First of all, since the D2-brane is embedded into the target space in the
shape of the cylinder, it is convenient to employ the cylindrical coordinates on
the  part. So the line element of the flat space-time 
is given by
 3 
  ds^2 &= -dt^2 + d^2 + ^2 d^2 + dz^2 + _i=4 ^9 (dx^i)^2 .
  Then the world-volume coordinates on the cylindrical D2-brane are
chosen as 
and the D2-brane is embedded into the target space like
 and . The constant  is the radius of 
the cylinder. 

Furthermore we add a fluctuation  
around , but neglect other fluctuations around  for simplicity.
Therefore the scalar fields on the D2-brane are written as 
 and .
Then the pullback metric on the D2-brane is given by
 3 
  P[]_  = 
   , where  and we introduced abbreviations
, 
 and .
The symbol  is used to clarify the pullback operation.
In addition to the scalar fields, 
the abelian gauge field  appears from
the massless excitation modes of the open string attached to the D2-brane. 
The field strength is denoted as .

By substituting the pullback () for the action (),
we obtain the effective action of the form,
 3 
  S_D 2  
  &= -T_2 dt ddz -
       

  &= - T_2 dt ddz     1 + _  ^  
  + ^2 2  F_ F^  
  - ^2 4  (^  
  _   F_  )^2  . 
This is the effective action for the cylindrical D2-brane.
The indices  are raised or lowered by the metric
 and 
.

In the next section we will construct a single D2-brane from multiple D0-branes.
To be precise, since the D0-brane charge corresponds to
the magnetic flux on the D2-brane, from multiple D0-branes,
we will be able to construct the D2-brane with constant magnetic flux
on the world-volume.
Therefore we must consider the case where the uniform magnetic
flux exists on the D2-brane world-volume.

The uniform magnetic flux on the cylindrical D2-brane
is described by choosing the field strength as 
. And from the quantization condition
of the magnetic flux, 
 3 
  1 2  ddz F_z  
  &= 2_c dz 2b  Z ,
the constant  is interpreted as the area occupied 
per a unit of magnetic flux. Then a fluctuation around this magnetic
flux background is added as
 3 
  F_z  = _c b  + f_z ,
where .
We also express the other field strengths by using small letters as 
 
and  
to clarify that these are the fluctuations around trivial backgrounds.

Finally it is natural to consider that 
the fluctuation  is sufficiently smaller
than the radius , that is, . 
In this case the effective action for the cylindrical D2-brane 
is estimated as
 3 
  S_D 2  &= - T_2  dt ddz  _c
   1 + _  ^  
  + ^2 2  F_ F^  
  - ^2 4  (^  
  _   F_  )^2 
  + O  (  _c  )   ,   

  &= - T_0    dt dz  _c
  [ 1 + ( -   ^2 +   '^2 )
  + ^2  - 1 _c^2 a _ ^2 
  + 1 _c^2  ( _c b  
  - a'_)^2 - f_tz ^2    

  &
  - ^2 _c^2      
  ( _c b  - a'_)
  +  ' a _^2 
  + O  (  _c  ) ]^1/2 . Here the indices  are raised or lowered by the metric
 and 
.
The second line holds if we assume that the fluctuations do not
depend on the angular direction .
The above effective action will be reconstructed from the nonabelian 
Born-Infeld action for D0-branes in the next section.




The effective action for the spherical D2-brane 




In this subsection we construct the effective action 
for the spherical D2-brane.
Since the D2-brane is embedded into the target space spherically,
we employ the spherical coordinates on
the  part. So the line element of the flat space-time 
is described as
 3 
  ds^2 &= -dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d^2 + r^2^2
  d^2 + _i=4 ^9 (dx^i)^2 . Then the world-volume coordinates on the spherical D2-brane are
chosen as ,
and the D2-brane is embedded into the target space like
 and . The constant  is the radius of 
the sphere. 

Furthermore we add a fluctuation  
around  but neglect other fluctuations around  for simplicity.
Therefore the scalar fields on the D2-brane are written as
 and .
And the pullback metric on the D2-brane is given by
 3 
  P[]_  = 
   , where  and we introduced abbreviations
, 
and .

By substituting the pullback () for the action (),
we obtain the effective action of the form,
 3 
  S_D 2  
  &= -T_2 dt dd-
        

  &= - T_2 dt dd r^2    1 + _r  ^r  
  + ^2 2  F_ F^  
  - ^2 4  (^  
  _r   F_  )^2  . 
This is the effective action for the spherical D2-brane.
The indices  are raised or lowered by the metric
 and 
.

The uniform magnetic flux on the spherical D2-brane
is described by choosing the field strength as 
. And from the quantization condition
of the magnetic flux, 
 3 
  1 2  ddF_  
  &= 4r_s^2 2b  Z ,
the constant  is interpreted as the area occupied 
per a unit of magnetic flux. A fluctuation around this magnetic flux background 
is added like
 3 
  F_  = r_s^2  b  + f_ ,
where .
We also express the other field strengths by using small letters as 
 
and  
to clarify that these are the fluctuations around trivial backgrounds.

Finally it is suitable to consider that 
the fluctuation  is sufficiently smaller
than the radius , that is, . 
In this case the effective action for the spherical D2-brane 
is evaluated as
 3 
  S_D 2  &= - T_2  dt dd r_s^2    1 + _r  ^r  
  + ^2 2  F_ F^  
  - ^2 4  (^  
  _r   F_  )^2 
  + O  (r  r_s  )   ,   

  &= - T_0    dt d r_s^2   [ 1 +  - r  ^2 + 1 r_s^2  r  '^2 
   + ^2  - 1 r_s^2 f_t ^2 
  + 1 r_s^4 ^2  ( r_s^2 b  
  + a'_)^2   

  &- 1 r_s^2 ^2  a _^2  
  - ^2 r_s^4 ^2   r   
  ( r_s^2  b  + a'_)
  - r ' a _^2 
  + O  (r  r_c  ) ]^1/2 . The indices  are raised or lowered by the metric
 and 
.
The second equation holds when the fluctuations do not
depend on the angular direction .
We will reconstruct the above action from the nonabelian Born-Infeld action
for D0-branes in the next section.




The effective action for the planar D2-brane 




Let us describe the effective action for the planar D2-brane.
First of all, since the D2-brane is embedded into the target space in the
shape of the plane, we employ the cylindrical coordinates on
the  part. So the line element of the flat space-time 
is given by ().
Then the world-volume coordinates on the planar D2-brane are
chosen as 
and the D2-brane is embedded into the target space like
 and . The constant  represents the position of 
the plane in the  direction.

We also include a fluctuation  
around  but neglect other fluctuations around  for simplicity.
Then the scalar fields on the D2-brane are written as 
 and .
The pullback metric on the D2-brane is given by
 3 
  P[]_  = 
   , where  and we introduced abbreviations
,  
and .

By substituting the pullback () for the action (),
we obtain the effective action of the form,
 3 
  S_D 2  
  &= -T_2 dt dd-
       

  &= - T_2 dt dd    1 + _z  ^z  
  + ^2 2  F_ F^  
  - ^2 4  (^  
  _z   F_  )^2  . 
This is the effective action for the planar D2-brane.
The indices  are raised or lowered by the metric
 and 
.

The uniform magnetic flux on the planar D2-brane
is described by choosing the field strength like 
. And from the quantization condition 
of the magnetic flux,
 3 
  1 2  ddF_  
  &= 2d 2b  Z ,
the constant  is interpreted as the area occupied 
per a unit of magnetic flux. Then a fluctuation around this magnetic 
flux background is added as
 3 
  F_  =  b  + f_ ,
where .
We also express the other field strengths by using small letters as 
 and
 
to clarify that these are the fluctuations around trivial backgrounds.

Finally in the case where the fluctuations do not depend on 
the angular direction ,
the effective action for the planar D2-brane is written as
 3 
  S_D 2  &= - T_0    dt d   [ 1 + ( - z  ^2 + z  '^2 )
  + ^2  - f_t ^2 
  + 1 ^2  (  b  
  + a'_)^2 - 1 ^2  a _^2 
     

  &
  - ^2 ^2   z   
  (  b  + a'_)
  - z ' a _^2 ]^1/2 . This action will be reconstructed from the nonabelian Born-Infeld action
for multiple D0-branes in the next section.




Construction of the D2-brane from Multiple D0-branes  



Preliminaries 




In this section we construct the D2-brane from multiple D0-branes.
As a preparation for that, in this subsection we investigate the 
properties of the effective action for multiple D0-branes.

It is well-known that the bosonic part of 
the effective action for  D0-branes is described by 
the nonabelian Born-Infeld action. 
This action possesses  gauge symmetry
and consists of  gauge field  and nine adjoint 
scalars  which
appear from the massless excitations of the open strings ending on D0-branes.
In the background of the flat space-time the nonabelian Born-Infeld action
for  D0-branes is expressed as
 3 
  S_D 0  &= -T_0 dt  STr  
  ( -P[E+E']_tt Q^i _j  ) , where  is the mass of the D0-brane and 
the notation STr represents the symmetrized trace prescription.
The matrices ,  and  are defined as
 3 
  E_  = _  ,E'_  = _i 
  (Q^-1 i  _j - ^i _j) _j  ,  Q^i _j = ^i _j + i  [X^i,X^j],
where  and .
And  represents the 10-dimensional flat space-time metric.
It is important to note that the pullback operations in the above action 
are modified to respect the 
gauge symmetry. Namely the partial derivatives should be replaced 
with the covariant derivatives as
 3 
  P[E]_tt  &= -1 + (D_t X^i)^2 ,   

  P[E']_tt  &= D_t X^i Q^-1 i  _j D_t X^j - (D_t X^i)^2 , where the covariant derivatives are defined as
.
Then the action () is rewritten as
 3 
  S_D 0  &= -T_0 dt  STr  
  ( Q^i _j - D_t X^i (Q) Q^-1 i  _j D_t X^j  ). 
  Note that the matrices such as  or  
behave as ordinary numbers through the calculations under the symmetrized 
trace operation. So we do not take care of the order of the matrices
at this stage.

Let us consider the case where multiple D0-branes form 
the fuzzy surface in the  space. In order to do this,
we only keep the matrices , ,  and  in the action 
and neglect the other adjoint scalars  for simplicity.
So it is reasonable to regard . Then the  matrix
 is written as
 3 
  Q^i _j &= 
   .
Note that the each element is also the  hermitian matrix.
Now we evaluate the interior of the square root in the action ().
First the determinant of the  matrix  is given by
 3 
  Q^i _j STr  =  
  1 - 1 2^2 [X^i,X^j]^2. The notation  is used to emphasize that
the above equation holds under the symmetrized trace prescription. 
Next the cofactor matrix  of the  
matrix  is estimated as
 3 
  Q_j  ^i = (Q) Q^-1 i  _j STr  = 
  _j^i - i  [X^i,X^j] - 1 4^2 
  _ikl [X^k,X^l]_jmn [X^m,X^n]. 
Then the second term in the square root is calculated as
 3 
  D_t X^i Q_j  ^i D_t X^j STr  = 
  (D_t X^i)^2 - 1 4 ^2 
  ( _ijk  D_t X^i [X^j,X^k] )^2, where .

Finally substituting the relations () and () for the
action (), we obtain the effective action of the form,
 3 
  S_D 0  &= -T_0  dt Tr   1 - (D_t X^i)^2
  - 1 2^2 [X^i,X^j]^2 + 1 4 ^2 
  ( _ijk  D_t X^i, [X^j,X^k]  )^2  . Here we replaced STr with the ordinary Tr operation by introducing 
 in the last term in the square root. 
It should be mentioned that this manipulation is
slightly different from the symmetrized trace operation since we symmetrized
not  but
.
In the following subsections, we will evaluate the above action in the 
background of the fuzzy cylinder, sphere and plane and show that 
the actions obtained there precisely coincides with 
those obtained in the previous section.
In order to achieve this, we need to modify the 
symmetrized trace operation as stated above.




The effective action for the fuzzy cylinder 




The identification of gauge fluctuations 




As we have discussed in the section , 
the fuzzy cylinder is described by the 
matrices (). In this subsection we consider fluctuations
around the fuzzy cylinder and identify the gauge degrees of freedom.
First of all we choose the matrices as
 3 
  X^1_mn  &= 1 2  _c e^il_c a_z  _m+1/2  _m+1,n  
  + 1 2  _c e^-il_c a_z  _m-1/2  _m,n+1  ,   

  X^2_mn  &= i 2  _c e^il_c a_z  _m+1/2  _m+1,n  
  - i 2  _c e^-il_c a_z  _m-1/2  _m,n+1  , 
    

  X^3_mn  &= (ml_c - l_c a_) _m _m,n  
  ,A_tmn  = a_t _m _m,n  . Here we employed the notation  which is equivalent to
. For example the notation  
represents . It should be mentioned that
the fluctuations ,  and 
depend on the time .

Now let us calculate the interior of the square root 
in the action () step by step. 
First the covariant derivatives are given by
 3 
  (D_t X^1)_mn  &= ia 2  f_tz 
  e^il_c a_z  _m+1/2  _m+1,n  - ia 2  f_tz 
  e^-il_c a_z  _m-1/2  _m,n+1  ,   

  (D_t X^2)_mn  &= - a 2  f_tz 
  e^il_c a_z  _m+1/2  _m+1,n  - a 2  f_tz 
  e^-il_c a_z  _m-1/2  _m,n+1  ,
  

  (D_t X^3)_mn  &= - l_c a __m _m,n  ,where  is defined as 
. 
We also used the relation , 
which represents the fuzziness of the D0-brane. 
From these the second term in the square root is evaluated as
 3 
  (D_t X^i)^2 _mn  &= a^2 ( f_tz ^2 
  + 1 _c^2  a _^2 ) _m _m,n  , 
  where  is defined as 
.

Second the commutators are given by
 3 
  1  [X^1,X^2]_mn  &= 0 ,   

  1  [X^2,X^3]_mn  &= ia^2 2_c  
  (_c a  - a'_) e^il_c a_z  
  _m+1/2  _m+1,n    
 
  &+ ia^2 2_c  
  (_c a  - a'_) e^-il_c a_z  
  _m-1/2  _m,n+1  , 
  

  1  [X^3,X^1]_mn  &= - a^2 2_c  
  (_c a  - a'_) e^il_c a_z  
  _m+1/2  _m+1,n    

  &+ a^2 2_c  
  (_c a  - a'_) e^-il_c a_z  
  _m-1/2  _m,n+1  , where  is defined as 
.
From these the third term in the square root is written as
 3 
  ( 1 2^2 [X^i,X^j]^2 )_mn  
  &= - a^4 ^2_c^2  (_c a  - a'_)^2 
  _m _m,n  , where  is defined as

.

Third the matrix
 is calculated as
 3 
  (_ijk  2  D_t X^i,[X^j,X^k] 
  )_mn  &= 0.
From this it is obvious that the fourth term in the square root is zero.

It is important to remark that both () and ()
are proportional to the unit matrix. This means that the square root part
in the action () is also proportional to the unit matrix
and the trace operation becomes just the sum of the diagonal elements.
Then we obtain the action of the form
 3 
  S_D 0  &= -T_0 dt _m _c l_c a 
  [ 1 + a^2  - 1 _c^2  a _^2 
  + a^2 ^2_c^2  (_c a  - a'_)^2 
  - f_tz ^2   ]^1/2  _m .
This is the effective action for the fuzzy cylinder with only gauge fields.

Let us consider the continuous limit of the above action.
When the separation parameter  is sufficiently small, 
it is possible to replace 
with . Then the above action reaches to the form
 3 
  S_D 0  &= -T_0 a  dt dz  _c
  [ 1 + a^2  - 1 _c^2  a _^2 
  + a^2 ^2_c^2  (_c a  - a'_)^2 
  - f_tz ^2   ]^1/2  .
It is easy to see that this action precisely coincides with the 
action () with  in the case of 
.
Therefore we conclude that the matrices () correctly describe
the gauge fluctuations on the D2-brane under the condition of 
.





The identification of a scalar fluctuation 




In the previous subsection the action () with 
is realized from the nonabelian Born-Infeld action for D0-branes.
Here we discuss the appearance of a scalar fluctuation from that action.
The starting point is the matrices of the form
 3 
  X^1_mn  &= 1 2  (_c+ ) _m+1/2  _m+1,n  
  + 1 2  (_c+ ) _m-1/2  _m,n+1  ,   

  X^2_mn  &= i 2  (_c+ ) _m+1/2  _m+1,n  
  - i 2  (_c+ ) _m-1/2  _m,n+1  ,
    

  X^3_mn  &= ml_c _m,n  ,A_tmn  = 0 . Note that the fluctuation  depends on the time .
We neglect the gauge fluctuations discussed in the previous subsection
in order to concentrate on the scalar fluctuation.

Let us evaluate the interior of the square root in the action ()
as before. First the covariant derivatives 
are given by
 3 
  (D_t X^1)_mn  &= 1 2     _m+1/2  _m+1,n  
  + 1 2     _m-1/2  _m,n+1  ,   

  (D_t X^2)_mn  &= i 2     _m+1/2  _m+1,n  
  - i 2     _m-1/2  _m,n+1  , 
  

  (D_t X^3)_mn  &= 0 . From these the second term in the square root is written as
 3 
  (D_t X^i)^2 _mn  &=   ^2 _m _m,n  , 
  where the right hand side is defined as 
.

Next the commutators are calculated as
 3 
  1  [X^1,X^2]_mn  &= ( - ia    '
  + O  (   _c  ) ) 
  _m _m,n  ,   

  1  [X^2,X^3]_mn  &= ( ia 2  
  + O (  _c ) )
  _m+1/2  _m+1,n  + ( ia 2  
  + O (  _c ) ) 
  _m-1/2  _m,n+1  , 
  

  1  [X^3,X^1]_mn  &= ( -a 2  
  + O (  _c ) )
  _m+1/2  _m+1,n  + ( a 2  
  + O (  _c ) )
  _m-1/2  _m,n+1  , where  is defined as
 
and we used the relation .
Then the third term in the square root becomes
 3 
  (1 2^2 [X^i,X^j]^2 )_mn  &= (
  - a^2 ^2  - a^2 ^2   '^2 
  + O (  _c ) ) _m _m,n  . 
  
Last the matrix  is 
calculated as
 3 
  (_ijk  2  D_t X^i,[X^j,X^k] )_mn  
  &= ( ia      
  + O (  _c ) ) _m _m,n ,
where  is defined as

.
From this the fourth term in the square root is given by
 3 
  (_ijk  2  D_t X^i,[X^j,X^k] 
  )_mn ^2 &= ( -a^2 ^2    ^2 
  + O (  _c )
  ) _m _m,n . This term does not appear in the previous subsection.

It is important to note that the terms (), 
() and () are proportional to the unit matrix.
This means that the square root part in the action () is also 
proportional to the unit matrix and the trace operation becomes just the 
sum of the diagonal elements. Then we obtain the action of the form
 3 
  S_D 0  &= - T_0 dt _m _c l_c a 
  [ 1 + ( -   ^2 + a^2 ^2  
   '^2 ) + a^2 ^2  
  - a^2 ^2    ^2 
  + O (  _c ) ]^1/2  _m .
This is the effective action for the fuzzy cylinder with only the scalar field.

Let us consider the continuous limit of the above action.
When the separation parameter  is sufficiently small, 
it is possible to replace 
with . Then the above action reaches to the form
 3 
  S_D 0  &= - T_0 a  dt dz  _c
  [ 1 + ( -   ^2 + a^2 ^2  
   '^2 ) + a^2 ^2  
  - a^2 ^2    ^2 
  + O (  _c ) ]^1/2  .
It is easy to see that this action precisely coincides with the 
action () with only the fluctuation , in the case of 
.
In other words, the matrices () correctly describe
the scalar fluctuation on the D2-brane under the condition of 
.



The effective action for the fuzzy cylinder 




In this subsection we construct the effective action for the fuzzy cylinder by
combining the results obtained so far.
First of all we choose the matrices for the fuzzy cylinder 
with the gauge and scalar fluctuations as
 3 
  X^1_mn  &= 1 2  (_c+ ) 
  e^il_c a_z  _m+1/2  _m+1,n  
  + 1 2  (_c+ ) 
  e^-il_c a_z  _m-1/2  _m,n+1  ,   

  X^2_mn  &= i 2  (_c+ ) 
  e^il_c a_z  _m+1/2  _m+1,n  
  - i 2  (_c+ ) 
  e^-il_c a_z  _m-1/2  _m,n+1  ,   

  X^3_mn  &= (ml_c - l_c a_) _m _m,n  
  ,A_tmn  = a_t _m _m,n  . Here the gauge fluctuations , ,  and
the scalar fluctuation  depend on the time .

Now let us calculate the interior of the square root 
in the action () step by step. 
First the covariant derivatives are given by
 3 
  (D_t X^1)_mn  &= 1 2  (    + ia f_tz  
  + O (  _c ) )
  e^il_c a_z  _m+1/2  _m+1,n    

  &+ 1 2  (    - ia f_tz 
  + O (  _c ) )
  e^-il_c a_z  _m-1/2  _m,n+1  ,   

  (D_t X^2)_mn  &= i 2  (    + ia f_tz  
  + O (  _c ) )
  e^il_c a_z  _m+1/2  _m+1,n  
  

  &- i 2  (    - ia f_tz 
  + O (  _c ) )
  e^-il_c a_z  _m-1/2  _m,n+1  ,   

  (D_t X^3)_mn  &= - l_c a __m _m,n  , where  is defined as 
. 
We also used the relation , 
which means that the area occupied per the D0-brane is . 
From these the second term in the square root is evaluated as
 3 
  (D_t X^i)^2 _mn  &=    ^2 + a^2 ( f_tz ^2 
  + 1 _c^2  a _^2 ) 
  + O (  _c )  _m _m,n  ,
  where  and  are defined as 
 and 

 respectively.

Second the commutators are given by
 3 
  1  [X^1,X^2]_mn  &= ( -ia   
   ' + O (  _c ) ) 
  _m _m,n  ,   

  1  [X^2,X^3]_mn  &= i 2 
   a^2 _c  (_c a  - a'_) 
  + O (  _c )  e^il_c a_z  
  _m+1/2  _m+1,n    
 
  &+ i 2   a^2 _c  
  (_c a  - a'_) 
  + O (  _c )  e^-il_c a_z  
  _m-1/2  _m,n+1  , 
  

  1  [X^3,X^1]_mn  &= - 1 2 
   a^2 _c  (_c a  - a'_) 
  + O (  _c )  e^il_c a_z  
  _m+1/2  _m+1,n    
 
  &+ 1 2   a^2 _c  
  (_c a  - a'_) 
  + O (  _c )  e^-il_c a_z  
  _m-1/2  _m,n+1  , where  and  are defined as 
 and
 
respectively. From these the third term in the square root is written as
 3 
  (1 2^2 [X^i,X^j]^2 )_mn  &= 
  - a^2 ^2  '^2 - a^4 ^2_c^2  
  (_c a  - a'_)^2 
  + O (  _c )  _m _m,n  ,
  where  is defined as

.

Third the matrix 
 is 
estimated as
) 3) 
  (_ijk ) 2)  D_t X^i,[X^j,X^k] )_mn) 
  &= [ ia^2) _c)    )  
  (_c) a)  - a'_)
  + ) ' a) _ 
  + O) ( ) _c) ) ] _m _m,n) ,
where  is defined as


.
Then the fourth term in the square root is given by
 3 
  (_ijk)  2  
  D_t X^i,[X^j,X^k] )_mn ^2 
  &= [ -a^4 ^2_c^2   )   
  (_c a  - a'_)
  +  ' a _^2 
  + O ()  _c ) ] _m _m,n .
  
Note that the terms (), 
() and () are proportional to the unit matrix.
This means that the square root part in the action () is also 
proportional to the unit matrix and the trace operation becomes just the 
sum of the diagonal elements. Then we obtain the action of the form
 3 
  S_D 0  &= -T_0 dt _m _c l_c a 
  [ 1 + ( -   ^2 
  + a^2 ^2   '^2 ) 
  + a^2  - 1 _c^2  a _^2 
  + a^2 ^2_c^2  
  (_c a  - a'_)^2 - f_tz ^2    

  &-a^4 ^2_c^2  
      (_c a  - a'_)
  +  ' a _^2 
  + O (  _c ) 
  ]^1/2  _m . This is the effective action for the fuzzy cylinder.

Let us consider the continuous limit of the above action.
When the separation parameter  is sufficiently small, 
it is possible to replace 
with . Then the above action reaches to the form
 3 
  S_D 0  &= - T_0 a  dt dz  _c
  [ 1 + ( -   ^2 
  + a^2 ^2   '^2 ) 
  + a^2  - 1 _c^2  a _^2 
  + a^2 ^2_c^2  
  (_c a  - a'_)^2 - f_tz ^2    

  &-a^4 ^2_c^2  
      (_c a  - a'_)
  +  ' a _^2 
  + O (  _c )
  ]^1/2  . This action precisely coincides with the 
action () in the case of .
In other words, the matrices () correctly describe
the gauge and scalar fluctuations on the D2-brane under the 
condition of .

From the results obtained so far, we conclude that the gauge fluctuations
on the D2-brane world-volume appear from the scalar fluctuations of
D0-branes which are parallel to the fuzzy cylinder and the scalar fluctuation
on the D2-brane does from the scalar fluctuations of
D0-branes which are perpendicular to the fuzzy cylinder.




The effective action for the fuzzy sphere 




As we have discussed in the section , 
the fuzzy sphere is described by the 
matrices (). In this subsection we consider the fluctuations
around the fuzzy sphere and construct the effective action for it.
First of all we choose the  matrices as
 3 
  X^1_mn  &= 1 2  (+ ) e^i(l/r_s)a_ 
  _m+1/2  _m+1,n  
  + 1 2  (+ ) e^-i(l/r_s)a_  
  _m-1/2  _m,n+1  ,   

  X^2_mn  &= i 2  (+ ) e^i(l/r_s)a_  
  _m+1/2  _m+1,n  
  - i 2  (+ ) e^-i(l/r_s)a_  
  _m-1/2  _m,n+1  ,   

  X^3_mn  &= (z+z ) _m _m,n  ,
  A_tmn  = a_t _m _m,n  , where .
As we observed in the section , 
 and  are the background elements 
which form the fuzzy sphere and explicitly written as 
 and 
 respectively.
The constant  represents the radius of the sphere.
, ,  and  are 
the fluctuations around the fuzzy sphere and depend on the time .
Each length  is defined so as to satisfy 
 and interpreted 
as an 'arc' between the th and
the th D0-branes. In particular the relation 
 holds in the continuous limit.

Now let us evaluate the interior of the square root 
in the action () step by step. 
First the covariant derivatives are given by
 3 
  (D_t X^1)_mn  &= 1 2  (    
  + ia r_s  f_t  + O (   ) ) 
  e^i(l/r_s) a_  _m+1/2  _m+1,n    

  &+ 1 2  (    - ia r_s  f_t 
  + O (   ) ) e^-i(l/r_s) a_  
  _m-1/2  _m,n+1  ,   

  (D_t X^2)_mn  &= i 2  (    
  + ia r_s  f_t  + O (   ) ) 
  e^i(l/r_s) a_  _m+1/2  _m+1,n  
  

  &- i 2  (    - ia r_s  f_t 
  + O (   ) ) e^-i(l/r_s) a_  
  _m-1/2  _m,n+1  ,   

  (D_t X^3)_mn  &= z   _m _m,n  , where  is defined as 

.
From these the second term in the square root is calculated as
 3 
  (D_t X^i)^2 _mn  &= (   ^2 + z  ^2 
  + a^2 r_s^2  f_t ^2 + O (   ) 
  ) _m _m,n  ,
where  and  are defined as

 and 

 respectively.

Next the commutators are written as
 3 
  1  [X^1,X^2]_mn  &= ( - ia r_s  
  ( ') + O (   ) ) 
  _m _m,n ,   

  1  [X^2,X^3]_mn  &= ( ia 2r_s  
  (z'+z ') + O (   ) ) 
  e^i(l/r_s) a_  _m+1/2  _m+1,n    

  &  + ( ia 2r_s  (z'+z ') 
  + O (   ) ) 
  e^-i(l/r_s) a_  _m-1/2  _m,n+1  , 
  

  1  [X^3,X^1]_mn  &= ( - a 2r_s  
  (z'+z ') + O (   ) ) 
  e^i(l/r_s) a_  _m+1/2  _m+1,n    

  &  + ( a 2r_s  (z'+z ') 
  + O (   ) ) 
  e^-i(l/r_s) a_  _m-1/2  _m,n+1  , where  and  are defined as 
 and
 and so on.
Each length  is also defined so as to satisfy the relation
, where 
.
As like the case of ,  is interpreted as 
an 'arc' around the th D0-brane and regarded as
 in the continuous limit.
From the above equations the third term in the square root is given by
 3 
  (1 2^2 [X^i,X^j]^2 )_mn  &= 
  ( - a^2 ^2 r_s^2  ( ')^2
  - a^2 ^2 r_s^2  (z'+z ')^2 
  + O (   ) ) _m _m,n  ,
where  is defined as

.

Last the matrix
 becomes
 3 
  ( _ijk  2  
  D_t X^i,[X^j,X^k] )_mn 
  &= ( - ia r_s  (z   
  ( ') -    (z'+z ') ) 
  + O (   ) ) _m _m,n  ,
where  is defined as


.
From this the fourth term in the square root is written as
 3 
  (_ijk  2  D_t X^i,[X^j,X^k] 
  )_mn ^2 &= ( - a^2 ^2 r_s^2  
  (z  ( ') 
  -   (z'+z ') )^2 
  + O (   ) ) _m _m,n  .

Now we are ready to evaluate the action (). 
From the calculations
so far, it is easy to see that the trace operation becomes just the 
summation since the the square root part is proportional to 
the unit matrix. Then we obtain the action of the form,
 3 
  S_D 0  &= -T_0 dt _m l a  
  [1 - (   ^2 + z  ^2 
  + a^2 r_s^2  f_t ^2 ) + ( a^2 ^2 r_s^2 
  ( ')^2 + a^2 ^2 _s^2  
  (z'+z ')^2 )   

  &  - a^2 ^2 r_s^2  (z  ( ') 
  -   (z'+z ') )^2 
  + O (   ) ]^1/2  _m . 
  This is the effective action for the fuzzy sphere.
At this stage, the correspondence between this action and 
the effective action for the spherical D2-brane ()
is not clear.

In order to observe the correspondence, we need to decompose the fluctuations
, ,  and 
 as
 3 
     _m &=  r_s  r   _m 
  + z r_s  ( a   a _) _m ,
  &
  z   _m &= z r_s r   _m 
  -  r_s  ( a   a _) _m ,   

   ' _m &=  r_s  r ' _m 
  + z r_s  ( a   a'_) _m ,
  &
  z ' _m &= z r_s r ' _m 
  -  r_s  ( a   a'_) _m ,
where  or  are the bases perpendicular 
to the fuzzy sphere and  
or  are those along the fuzzy sphere.

Let us consider the continuous limit by taking  sufficiently large.
Then  and  are replaced with
 and  respectively and 
becomes . It is also useful to notice that
 3 
  ( ')^2+(z'+z ')^2 &= r '^2 
  + ( r_s + a r_s   a_)^2,   

  z  ( ') -    (z'+z ') 
  &= r   ( r_s + a r_s   a_)
  - r ' ( a r_s   a _) .
By applying these relations to the action, it reaches to the form
 3 
  S_D 0  &= -T_0 a   dt d 
  r_s^2 [1 + ( - r  ^2 + 
  a^2 ^2 r_s^2  r '^2 ) + a^2 
   - 1 r_s^2  f_t ^2 +
  a^2 ^2 r_s^4 ^2  ( r_s^2 a  
  + a'_)^2   

  &- 1 r_s^2 ^2  a _^2  
  - a^4 ^2 r_s^4 ^2   r   
  ( r_s^2 a + a_) - r ' 
  a _^2 + O (r  r_s ) 
  ]^1/2  . This action precisely coincides with the 
action () in the case of .
In other words, the matrices () correctly reproduce
the gauge and scalar fluctuations on the D2-brane under the 
condition of .

From the results obtained in this subsection, 
we conclude that the gauge fluctuations
on the D2-brane world-volume arise from the scalar fluctuations of
D0-branes which are parallel to the fuzzy sphere and the scalar fluctuation
on the D2-brane does from the scalar fluctuations of
D0-branes which are perpendicular to the fuzzy sphere.




The effective action for the fuzzy plane 




In this subsection we construct the effective action for the fuzzy plane
by adding the fluctuations around this background.
As we have discussed in the section  ,
the matrices which represents the fuzzy plane is given by ().
And there we defined 
and introduced the length  so as to satisfy the relation
.
This meant that the each area occupies the constant area .
Here we interpret the area  as the fuzziness of the D0-brane.

Now we also define the length  so as to satisfy 
.
The length  is considered to represent the separation 
between the th D0-brane and th D0-brane, since the separation
is written as .
With these preparations we adopt the fluctuations around the fuzzy plane as
 3 
  X^1_mn  &= 1 2  (+ l a_)
  e^il a_  _m+1/2  _m+1,n  
  + 1 2  (+ l a_)
  e^- il a_  _m-1/2  _m,n+1  ,   

  X^2_mn  &= i 2  (+ l a_)
  e^il a_  _m+1/2  _m+1,n  
  - i 2  (+ l a_)
  e^- il a_  _m-1/2  _m,n+1  ,   

  X^3_mn  &= (z_0 + z ) _m _m,n  ,  A_tmn  = a_t _m _m,n  . Here the fluctuations , ,  
and  depend on the time .

Now let us evaluate the interior of the square root in the 
action () step by step.
First the covariant derivatives are evaluated as
 3 
  (D_t X^1)_mn  &= 1 2  ( a   a _  + ia f_t  + O (l a_  ) )
  e^il a_  _m+1/2  _m+1,n    

  &+ 1 2  ( a   a _  - ia f_t  + O (la_  ) )
  e^-il a_  _m-1/2  _m,n+1 ,   

  (D_t X^2)_mn  &= i 2  ( a   a _  + ia f_t  + O (la_  ) )
  e^il a_  _m+1/2  _m+1,n  
  

  &- i 2  ( a   a _  - ia f_t  + O (la_  ) )
  e^-il a_  _m-1/2  _m,n+1 ,   

  (D_t X^3)_mn  &= z   _m _m,n  , where  is defined as 
.
From these the second term in the square root is calculated as
 3 
  (D_t X^i)^2 _mn  &=  z ^2 + a^2 ( 1 ^2  
  a _^2 + f_t ^2 ) + O  (la_  ) 
   _m _m,n  ,
where  and  are defined as

 and 

respectively.

Second the commutators are estimated as
 3 
  1   [X^1,X^2]_mn  &=  -ia^2  
  (  a  + a'_) + O (la_  ) 
   _m _m,n ,   

  1   [X^2,X^3]_mn  &= i 2  ( a   
  z ' + O  (la_  ) ) 
  e^il a_  _m+1/2  _m+1,n    

  &
  + i 2  ( a   z ' + O  
  (la_  ) ) e^- il a_  _m-1/2  _m,n+1  ,
  

  1   [X^3,X^1]_mn  &= - 1 2  ( a   
  z ' + O  (la_  ) ) 
  e^il a_  _m+1/2  _m+1,n    

  &
  + 1 2  ( a   z ' + O  
  (la_  ) ) e^- il a_  _m-1/2  _m,n+1  , 
  where 
and .
Then the third term in the square root becomes
 3 
  (1 2^2 [X^i,X^j]^2 )_mn  &=
   - a^2 ^2  z '^2
  - a^4 ^2 ^2  (  a  + 
  a'_)^2 + O  (la_  ) 
  _m _m,n  ,
where  is defined as
.

Third the matrix  
is calculated as
 3 
  (_ijk  2  D_t X^i,[X^j,X^k] 
  )_mn  &= [ - ia^2   
   z   (  a  + a'_) 
  - z ' a _ + O  (la_  ) 
  ] _m _m,n ,
where  is defined as


.
From this the fourth term in the square root is evaluated as
 3 
  (_ijk  2  D_t X^i,[X^j,X^k] 
  )^2_mn  &= [ - a^4 ^2 ^2  
   z   (  a  + a'_) 
  - z ' a _^2 + O  (la_  ) 
  ] _m _m,n .

Now we are ready to evaluate the action (). 
From the calculations
so far, it is easy to see that the trace operation becomes just the 
summation since the the square root part is proportional to 
the unit matrix. Then we obtain the effective action of the form
 3 
  S_D 0  &= -T_0  dt _m=1 ^l a 
  [ 1 + ( -z  ^2 + a^2 ^2 z '^2 )
  + a^2 - f_t ^2 
  + a^2 ^2 ^2  (  a  + a'_)^2
  - 1 ^2  a _^2    

  &  - a^4 ^2^2  
   z   (  a  + a'_) 
  - z ' a _^2
  + O  (la_  ) ]^1/2  _m . This is the effective action for the fuzzy plane.

Let us consider the continuous limit of the above action.
When the fuzziness of the D0-brane  is sufficiently small, 
it is possible to replace 
with . Then the above action reaches to the form
 3 
  S_D 0  &= - T_0 a   dt d   [ 1 + ( -z  ^2 + a^2 ^2 z '^2 )
  + a^2 - f_t ^2 
  + a^2 ^2 ^2  (  a  + a'_)^2
  - 1 ^2  a _^2    

  &  - a^4 ^2^2  
   z   (  a  + a'_) 
  - z ' a _^2
  + O  (a a_ ^2 ) ]^1/2  . This action precisely coincides with the 
action () in the case of .
In other words, the matrices () correctly describe
the gauge and scalar fluctuations on the D2-brane under the 
condition of .

From the results obtained in this subsection, 
we conclude that the gauge fluctuations
on the D2-brane world-volume appear from the scalar fluctuations of
D0-branes which are parallel to the fuzzy plane and the scalar fluctuation
on the D2-brane does from the scalar fluctuations of
D0-branes which are perpendicular to the fuzzy plane.




Conclusions and Discussions 




Through this paper we have investigated the correspondence between
the single D2-brane action, which is described by the abelian Born-Infeld 
action, and multiple D0-branes action,
which is done by the nonabelian Born-Infeld action.
And we found that these two actions precisely coincide with each other
if the condition  holds.

In the section , we obtained the matrices which
describe the fuzzy cylinder, sphere, plane
and the general fuzzy surface with axial symmetry.
It should be emphasized that the explicit expressions of the matrices
(), () ,() and ()
make us possible to understand these fuzzy geometries pictorially
as Figs.,  and .

In the section , the effective actions for the cylindrical,
spherical and planar D2-brane with magnetic flux on the world-volume 
are obtained by evaluating the abelian Born-Infeld action.
The results are given by (), () and
(), and the parameter  introduced there represents
the area occupied per a unit of magnetic flux.

In the section , we have constructed the effective
actions for the fuzzy cylinder, sphere and plane
by evaluating the nonabelian Born-Infeld action for D0-branes. 
We started from the matrices
(), () and () and obtained
the results (), () and
(). The parameter  introduced there 
represents the fuzziness of the D0-brane.
Our main result is that in the continuous limit
the effective actions reach to (), () and
(), and those are precisely coincident with
the actions (), () and
() respectively under the condition of .

Let us consider the physical meaning of the above conditions step by step.
First the condition  is easy to understand if we note
that the charge of the D0-brane and the the magnetic flux on the D2-brane
are essentially the same quantum number.
It is interesting to mention that if we neglect the gauge
and scalar fluctuations, for example, the potential energy for 
the fuzzy cylinder precisely reaches to that for the cylindrical 
D2-brane in the continuous limit, only under the condition of .

Next let us consider the meaning of .
It is easy to see that the area  is expressed as
 3 
  (2_s)^2 T_2 = T_0,
where  is the tension of the D2-brane and  is the mass of the
D0-brane. This means that the mass of the D2-brane with the 
area  is equal to the mass of the D0-brane.
In other words, the D0-brane can transform into the D2-brane with the area
 in view of the energy conservation.
Therefore it might be natural to conclude that
multiple D0-branes can describe the D2-brane if the condition
 holds.

As a future work, it is interesting to apply our methods obtained in
this paper to more complicated cases. For example, it would be possible
to construct the nonabelian D2-branes action from multiple D0-branes
or the abelian D3-brane action from multiple D1-branes action.
It is also interesting to apply our methods to 
construct fundamental strings or a pair of brane anti-brane 
system.
