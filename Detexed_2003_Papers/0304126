We compute
the corrections to
heterotic-string backgrounds with (2,0) world-sheet
supersymmetry, up to two loops in
sigma-model perturbation theory. We investigate
the conditions for these backgrounds to preserve
spacetime supersymmetry and we find that a sufficient requirement
for consistency is
 the applicability
of the -lemma. In particular, we
investigate the  corrections to (2,0) heterotic-string
compactifications and we find that the Calabi-Yau geometry of the
internal space is deformed to a Hermitian one. We show that at
first order in , the heterotic anomaly-cancellation mechanism
does not induce any lifting of  moduli. We explicitly compute the
corrections to the conifold and 
to the -invariant Calabi-Yau metric at
first order in . We also find a generalization  of the 
gauge-field equations, compatible with the Donaldson equations on
 conformally-balanced Hermitian manifolds.

Introduction 


The dynamics of the massless superstring modes
of the various superstring theories
admit a description in terms of ten-dimensional
effective supergravities.
The latter include, in particular, an infinite tower of  
corrections.
 From the world-sheet perspective,
the  equations of the
target-space fields are
vanishing conditions
for the sigma model beta functions, i.e.
conditions for  conformal invariance.
In this approach,  is the loop-counting parameter in the sigma-model
perturbation theory. At zeroth order in , the vanishing of the
beta functions is equivalent to
the field equations of ordinary  supergravity theories.
Terms linear or higher in  are associated with corrections
involving quadratic or higher polynomials
in the spacetime curvature and their supersymmetric completions.

 For generic heterotic-string backgrounds
the -corrections to sigma-model couplings are not known.
As a result, most configurations relevant to string
theory that have appeared in the literature,
like the  compactifications of, 
the five-braneand various five-brane intersections, are solutions
of ordinary supergravity theories.
In cases where there is sufficient world-volume supersymmetry, one
can argue that higher-order corrections are absent, see
 for a general argument.
In general however, the investigation of stringy effects
requires taking the  corrections into account. One such background
is the heterotic five-brane which emerges
at one loop in sigma-model perturbation. This and other related results 
have been extended to three loops in.


The low-energy dynamics of the heterotic string is
given by  supergravity in ten dimensions.
The bosonic fields of the theory
are the spacetime metric , the NS three-form field strength ,
the dilaton 
and the gauge field . The Green-Schwarz 
anomaly-cancellation mechanism  requires that the three-form Bianchi identity
receive an  correction of the form

dH=-4  (p_1(M)-p_1(E))+O(
where ,  are the first Pontrjagin forms  of
spacetime  and of
the vector bundle  with connection , respectively.
In the  expansion for ,
,
the lowest-order term  should be a closed three-form , i.e. .
This stems from the fact that at tree-level in the sigma model,
the string couples to a
two-form gauge potential , where .
On the other hand,
if ,
then  and so .
Global anomaly cancellation requires in addition
that  be exact , i.e. that  be globally defined.

A class of heterotic-string backgrounds for which the  Bianchi identity
of the three-form  receives
a correction of the type () are those with (2,0) world-volume
supersymmetry. Such models were considered in . The target-space
geometry of  (2,0)-supersymmetric sigma models
 has been extensively investigated in.
Recently,
there is  revived interest in these modelsas string backgrounds and in connection to
heterotic-string compactifications with fluxes
.


In this paper we investigate the  corrections
to heterotic-string backgrounds with (2,0)-world-sheet
supersymmetry. We take spacetime to be
 and demand that the background preserve
 of  spacetime supersymmetry. 
The  case was examined in.
The manifold
 is Hermitian equipped with a compatible
connection  with skew-symmetric torsion , i.e.
  is Kahler  with torsion (KT).
At first order in , the holonomy of the connection
 is contained in  and  is  conformally balanced,
see appendix A.

We show that at linear order in  
such spacetime-supersymmetric backgrounds
satisfy the anomaly-cancellation
condition and the field equations.
In the proof, we make use of the results ofsummarised in appendix A of the present paper.
We find that the corrections to the other fields are determined
by the corrections to the metric. We stress
that consistency  of the anomaly cancellation condition with
the field equations requires that in
the latter we include the two-loop  contribution. A
sufficient condition for the consistency of 
spacetime supersymmetry with the anomaly cancellation
and the field equations, is the applicability
of the -lemma(The -lemma
is not  valid on all non-Kahler Hermitian manifolds.)  on .


We also consider the  Donaldson
equations on a non-Kahler Hermitian manifold. These
are related to the gaugino Killing-spinor equation.
 For generic Hermitian manifolds, it is not apparent that 
the Donaldson equations
are associated with a second-order equation for the gauge connection,
i.e. a field equation. We find that they are, however,
 if the underlying Hermitian manifold
is conformally balanced.

It has been shown in that
if  is compact, nonsingular
and all fields are smooth, then  vanishes and
to zeroth order in the  expansion
 is a Calabi-Yau -fold.
We shall take this to be the starting point of
the  expansion.
Proceeding to first order in ,  is deformed
to a conformally-balanced KT manifold with
.
We determine the deformations of the fields using Hodge theory.
Moreover, we compute the dimension of the moduli
space and we find it to be the same as that 
of the moduli
space of the underlying
Calabi-Yau manifold.  We therefore conclude that at this order in ,
 there is no lifting  of moduli in (2,0) compactifications with .
As particular examples of the general theory mentioned above,
we compute the  corrections to the
 conifold and to the 
-invariant Calabi-Yau metric found in
. We find that the
singularity of the conifold persists to first order in .

 This paper is organised as follows: In section two,
we establish our notation and
write down the field
and the Killing-spinor equations
for the heterotic string,
up to two loops in sigma-model perturbation theory 
(order ).
In section three, we give  the conditions
 on the deformations of the metric required by spacetime supersymmetry,
  and express the deformations
 of the NS three-form and
the dilaton in terms of those of the metric.
 We then show that the Killing-spinor 
equations for the aforementioned set of fields
imply the field equations at this order
in , provided the anomalous Bianchi identity of
the  field is satisfied.
In section four, we show that the gaugino Killing-spinor
 equation, which is equivalent to
the Donaldson equations on a Hermitian
 manifold, implies the field equation for the gauge connection.
 In section five, we compute the  corrections
to the fields and show that the dimension
 of the moduli space  is the same as that
of the moduli space 
 of the Calabi-Yau space we started with at zeroth order in .
 In section six and seven, we compute the  corrections
to the conifold and to the Calabi metric, respectively. In section
 eight, we discuss the consequences of our results in the context
 of compactifications with fluxes and we comment on 
 corrections beyond two-loops. In appendix A, we summarise some
 of the properties of KT geometry. In appendix B, we explain the
 relation between the Lichnerowicz and Laplace operators. Finally,
in appendix C
we give a solution to the
field equations at linear order in  without
the use of the Killing-spinor equations.



Field and Killing-spinor equations 


The bosonic fields of the ten-dimensional  supergravity
which arises as low energy effective theory of the heterotic
string  are the spacetime
metric , the NS  three-form field strength , the  dilaton 
 and the gauge connection .
We define the connections



where  is the Levi-Civita connection of the metric  and 

are spacetime indices.
The three form  has an expansion in  of the form(
Our form conventions are

.) 
H=T-( Q_3(^(-) )-Q_3(A))+O(where  is a closed three-form, 
 and   are Chern-Simons three-forms. We have
dH-P+O(14 
[tr  (R^(-) R^(-) )-tr ( FF)] ,
pontrj 
where the trace on the gauge indices is taken as



Similarly for the trace of , where  is
the curvature of the connection .
The four-form  is proportional to the difference
of the Pontrjagin forms of the tangent
bundle of spacetime and Yang-Mills bundle of the heterotic string.


The string frame field equations of the heterotic string up to two-loops  in sigma model
perturbation theory are
R_MN +14  H^R _ML  H^L _NR +2_M_N            &&
+ [ R^(-)  _MPQR  R^(-)  _N ^PQR 
- F_MPab  F_N ^Pab ]
+O(

_M(e^-2  H^M _RL )+O(

^(+)  ^M(e^-2  F_MN )+O(where  we have suppressed the
gauge indices.
The field equation  of the dilaton  is implied from the
 first two equations above.  Our curvature conventions
are given in appendix A.

Let 
be a basis of the Clifford algebra Cliff(), i.e.

.
Then the string frame Killing-spinor equations(We have  used the notation
.)

F_MN ^MN +O(,
where  is a section of the
 spin bundle .(
The spin group  has two
inequivalent irreducible sixteen-dimensional
spinor representations and  are the associated bundles.)  
It is clear that the first Killing
 spinor equation is a parallel
transport equation for the connection .
Since the connection
of the spin bundle  is induced from the
tangent bundle of spacetime,
the investigation of this Killing-spinor equation
is greatly simplified. The first, second
and third Killing-spinor equations are associated with
the supersymmetry transformations of the
gravitino, dilatino and gaugino, respectively.
We shall use this terminology in what
follows to distinguish between them.



It is clear from the field equations that the  two-loop contribution to
the Einstein equations 
is at the same order as the modification of the torsion 
due to the cancellation of the heterotic anomaly.  
Consistency then
requires 
that both should be taken into account. The various field and Killing-spinor
equations are expected to receive corrections to all orders in .
Therefore a solution of the field and/or Killing-spinor equations
of the effective supergravity theory can be expanded as
G&=&g+h+O(

H&=&T+f +O(

&=&+

A&=& B+Q+O(In this expansion, the fields  solve
the field and the Killing-spinor equations at  zeroth-order in .
We again remark that  although  may not  vanish, .
The deformation  linear in  is the
first-order correction to the background .
Of course, the fields receive higher-order corrections in .
In what follows, we  determine the deformations  by requiring that
 in () solve the field ()
and Killing-spinor ()  equations.


The  corrections to backgrounds with torsion 

 World-sheet and spacetime supersymmetry 

We  restrict our attention to heterotic string backgrounds
of the form
ds^2&=&ds^2(^10-2n )+ds^2(X_n)


T&=&13!  T_ijk (y) dy^idy^jdy^k


&=&(y)


B&=&B_i(y) dy^i
where
  are coordinates on a
manifold  ,  , and  as we have explained in
the introduction.


In addition, we  require that the background  
be compatible with
(2,0) world-sheet supersymmetry. This means that  the light-cone gauged fixed
string world-sheet action is (2,0)-supersymmetric.
In particular this implies that    is a hermitian manifold,
, with complex structure
 which is parallel with respect to  connection, i.e.
 is a KT manifold. The torsion  of KT manifolds is specified
by the metric  and the complex structure , see appendix A.

The  background () is expected to receive 
corrections because the supergravity field equations are modified
by two- and higher-loop contributions   in sigma model perturbation
theory and in particular by the heterotic anomaly-cancellation mechanism.
After these  corrections are included,  the background
is expected to be of the form
ds^2&=&ds^2(^10-n )+ds^2(X_n)


H&=&13!  H_ijk (y) dy^idy^jdy^k


&=&(y)


A&=&A_i(y) dy^i ,
where .
The three-form  is not  necessarily closed,
 because of ().


As we have seen,  sigma model loop effects and the heterotic anomaly
cancellation mechanism alter the geometry of the manifold .
Nevertheless, it is expected that if the original manifold  has
a KT structure, the  geometry, after the corrections are taken
into account, remains KT.
So the manifold   has a KT  structure as well but now
the torsion  is not  closed.
This is because it is
expected that there is a scheme
which preserves the (2,0) world-volume  supersymmetry
 in sigma model perturbation theory.

A solution  of the zeroth order in  field equations
associated  with KT manifold  does not  necessarily satisfy
the Killing-spinor equations () of supergravity theory. The conditions
for  to satisfy the gravitino, dilatino and gaugino
Killing-spinor equations  are
hol (^(+) )SU(n)  &,&                 F(B)_2,0 =F(B)_0,2 =0 &,&             ^ij  F(B)_ij =0 ,
where  is the
holonomy of the connection , 
 is the Kahler form
and   is the Lee form of the
 Hermitian geometry.  (The Lee-form has been given
in appendix A). KT manifolds for which the Lee-form is
 exact  are called conformally
balanced . The conditions on the curvature  of the gauge connection
 required by the gaugino Killing-spinor equations imply
that  is a (1,1)-form with respect to the complex structure 
and its trace with  vanishes. 
I.e. considered as a two-form  takes values
 in the Lie algebra of . These conditions 
are the analogue of the Donaldson
 equations for Hermitian manifolds.
 It can be shown that the backgrounds of () 
preserve  of spacetime supersymmetry.

Conversely if  in ()
satisfies the Killing-spinor
equations () preserving  of spacetime supersymmetry,
then  is a conformally balanced KT manifold and
the holonomy of  is contained in .


As we have explained, 
the geometry of the background  ()
is expected to be KT. However, it is not apparent that if the
  background
is
 spacetime supersymmetric, then  will also 
be spacetime supersymmetric.
The
corrections to Killing-spinor equations
of supergravity ()
at order  are
determined by the corrections
to the metric and
the torsion but otherwise their
dependence on the metric and the torsion remains the same
(It is not expected that this property of the Killing
spinor equations  persists to all 
orders in sigma model perturbation
theory. The dependence of the Killing-spinor equations on the metric 
and the torsion
will change at higher orders.) .
This has the consequence that 
if we insist that the corrected background 
preserve the same number of supersymmetries as , then
 is again a KT manifold for which 
,
  and , . 
In this case,
  and  are the connection, Lee form and Kahler
 form of the metric , respectively.


We conclude that at linear order in  , the corrections to the
geometry of   
are deformations which preserve the following two properties:
 

  is a conformally balanced KT manifold and

   the holonomy  is contained in .


In what follows, we  derive the
conditions on the deformations of the geometry which preserve the above properties and we solve the field and Killing-spinor
equations to first order in . We  also present a similar analysis
for the conditions on the gauge connection.



Gravitino and dilatino Killing-spinor equations 


As we have mentioned,
 in order to solve the gravitino and dilatino Killing-spinor equations,
we have to specify the
deformations   which preserve the
properties that   is conformally balanced KT manifold and 
 .

 First, we  consider  deformations which preserve the
hermiticity of the metric with respect to the complex structure . This
means that  ,
where  are labels for the
holomorphic coordinates on .
It can then be easily shown that 
 provided that the deformation for the torsion is
f_ =-_h_ 
+_h_  ,
where  is the Levi-Civita connection of the metric ,
 and the rest
of the components vanish. The latter is required because the torsion
of a KT geometry is a (2,1)- and (1,2)-form.


Furthermore, the deformation of the connection
of the canonical bundle(This is the diagonal
 part of a   connection on the tangent bundle.)  of 
associated with 
is
_(G)&=&(g)_+[2i _h_ ^i _h^ _&+&
i T_  _  g^  h_ -
iT_  h^ ]+ O(where  is the  connection of the canonical bundle
associated with the connection(To avoid confusion, sometimes we use the notation
 to denote the connection  with respect
to the metric .) 
  
 and .
 A necessary and sufficient condition for 
 is that the curvature of the canonical bundle vanishes.
 For the connection (), a sufficient condition is
2i _h_ ^i _h^ _+
i T_  _  g^  h_ -
iT_  h^ =0 ,
where .

It remains to find the condition required for  to remain conformally
balanced after the deformation.
  For this, we compute the first-order deformation of the Lee form
to find
_ [-_(g^  h_ )
-_h_  g^ +12 
 T_  h^ -12 
 H^  _   g^  h_  ,
  where  is the Lee-form of the  geometry.
Substituting () in (), we find that
__(g^  h_ )
The dilatino Killing-spinor equation can be solved by
setting
14  g^  h_  .
Therefore the dilaton is deformed to





The  equations that remain to be solved are those in ().
Observe that these equations are  in number, 
i.e. as many as the diffeomorphisms of
. Since there is some redundancy in specifying the deformation
 up to an infinitesimal  diffeomorphism generated
by the vector field , i.e. 
, it is expected
on physical grounds that it is always  possible to choose an  so that ()
is satisfied. Therefore () can be viewed as   a choice of gauge fixing
for diffeomorphisms of .
In the following,  we provide more evidence that this  is a good gauge choice.

It remains to examine the conditions on the gauge connection.
We postpone  this for after the investigation of the field
equations of the metric and the two-form gauge potential.





The solutions of field equations 

Having derived the conditions for 
the deformations to
satisfy the gravitino and dilatino Killing-spinor
equations, we  now focus on the solutions of the field equations for the
metric and the NS two-form  potential. In particular we  show that at
order  both these field equations are satisfied
 provided that the heterotic anomaly-cancellation
condition holds.

Assuming that the background  satisfies the field equations
at zeroth order in , substituting   () in the field equation
for the metric  and
collecting the terms linear in , we find
_Lh_ij &-&14 T_imn  f_j ^mn -14  T_jmn  f_i ^mn 
+12  h^mn  g^kl  T_imk  T_jnl 
&+& 2_i_j -g^kl  (_i h_jk +_j h_ik - _kh_ij ) _l_0+S_ij =0 ,
where  is the Lichnerowicz operator
with respect to the metric  (see appendix B) and



is the two loop contribution to the beta function.
The curvature  is with respect to   and .

Clearly, () is rather involved. To proceed, we take the original
background  
  to be spacetime supersymmetric in the
 sense described in the previous section.
In addition we assume that after the deformation the
background remains supersymmetric. As we have
seen this is equivalent to requiring that the  KT geometry 
be conformally balanced and .
Substituting the deformation () in
() of appendix A and collecting the terms linear in ,
we find that
_Lh_ij &-&14 T_imn  f_j ^mn -14  T_jmn  f_i ^mn 
+12  h^mn  g^kl  T_imk  T_jnl 
&+& 2_i_j -g^kl  (_i h_jk +_j h_ik - _kh_ij ) _l_0
=14  J^k _i df_kjmn  ^mn 
Observe that there is no explicit contribution of the metric deformation
 on the right-hand-side of  (). This is because at zeroth order the
torsion is closed, .
Using () and (), we find that
14  J^k _i df_kjmn  ^mn +S_ij =0 .
Next consider the anomaly-cancellation condition ()
which to linear order in  can be
written as
df=-P ,
where  depends on .
Since we have assumed that the background  is
supersymmetric,   and  satisfy the
conditions
R^(-) _mn  ^i _j J^m _k J^n _l&=&R^(-) _kl  ^i _j ,      ^mn 
R^(-) _mn  ^i _j=0
F_mn  ^a _bJ^m _k J^n _l&=&F_kl  ^a _b , 
       ^mn F_mn  ^a _b=0 .
These conditions on  can be easily deduced from the fact that
the holonomy of  is contained in  and
 provided that the torsion is closed
(). The conditions on  can be deduced from the Killing-spinor
equations of the gaugino.
Contracting the anomaly-cancellation condition(This derivation
of () from () is sensitive to the relative numerical
coefficient of the two-loop contribution to the metric field equation and
that of the anomaly-cancellation condition.) 
 () with the Kahler form  and  using (),
 it is easy to see that the  field equation for the metric ()
 is satisfied.


In order to solve the field equations for the metric, it is sufficient to
solve the anomaly-cancellation condition (). Substituting ()
in (), we find that
P=-2i Y
where . The global anomaly-cancellation condition
requires that  be exact. Since  is an exact, real (2,2)-form, if the
-lemma
is valid on , then there is a real (1,1)-form  globally defined  on  such that
() is satisfied. On Hermitian manifolds 
which are not  Kahler,
the -lemma is not  
valid in general. Therefore a sufficient 
condition for the existence of spacetime supersymmetric solutions
in backgrounds with non-vanishing
torsion, , 
is the validity  of the -lemma.

The solution to the anomaly-cancellation condition () is
not unique. Indeed, if  satisfies (), then
Y'=Y+w+w
where   is a (1,0)-form, is also a solution. This gauge freedom in 
is equivalent to specifying the deformation   in the metric
up to an infinitesimal diffeomorphism. This can be easily seen by setting
. Therefore having determined  from
(), we still have the gauge freedom to solve the supersymmetry condition
().

The solution of () up to a gauge transformation
() is not unique. The classes of independent solutions
are described by the Aeppli group   defined
by





see for a related discussion.
The dimension of this group is the dimension of the moduli space
of solutions of (). However it is not apparent that all elements
of this group are associated with 
spacetime-supersymmetric deformations. The latter
 should in addition satisfy ().




It remains to show that 
the field equations of the NS two-form gauge potential are  satisfied
as well. The proof of this is based on an identity shown in (corollary 3.2) which
can be stated as follows: Let  be a conformally balanced KT manifold
with torsion , ,
and  ,
then
^iH_ijk =_i H^i _jk  .
This statement is valid irrespectively  of whether or not  is a small perturbation
of another metric .

Both KT structures  and  satisfy
the aforementioned  conditions because they are supersymmetric.  Therefore
 both
satisfy () with their respective torsions and Lee forms.
Using () for the  corrected  background , the
field equation () for the NS two-form
-2_i H^i _jk +^iH_ijk +O(can be written as



which vanishes identically because   is conformally balanced.
Since the field equations for the background  are satisfied
by assumption and as we have shown  the field equations ()  for
 are satisfied as well,
the part  of () linear in 
vanishes identically.   Therefore the
field equations for the NS two-form gauge potential
are satisfied without additional conditions
on the deformation  of the metric.

The gauge field 

The main purpose 
of this section is to show that the Killing-spinor equations
of the gaugino imply the field equations of the gauge field before  
and after the
 corrections are taken into account. The simplest way to show this
is by investigating the properties
of gauge fields on conformally balanced KT manifolds.



Gauge Fields on KT conformally balanced manifolds 


We first describe
the well-known relation between the Donaldson equations and the field
equations of a gauge connection on a Kahler manifold.
Let  be a vector bundle over a Kahler  manifold 
 equipped with a connection 
with curvature . If  satisfies the Donaldson equations
F_0,2 =F_2,0 =0 ,        ^ij  F_ij =0 ,
then it is straightforward to show that   solves the field equations
^i F_ij =0 .
The proof makes use of the Jacobi identities for .
Donaldson has shown that if  is a stable bundle over a complex surface
 ,
then there is a unique connection which
solves ().

Next suppose   that  is a vector bundle over a non -Kahler
conformally-balanced KT manifold
 equipped with a connection 
with curvature . 
Donaldson equations () can be easily generalised
to  KT manifolds by allowing  to be the Kahler
form of the Hermitian metric . We shall show that the Donaldson equations
imply the field equations
^(+)  ^i(e^-2  F(A)_ij )=0 ,
where  is the connection of the KT structure  with torsion 
and Lee form .
 For this we choose complex coordinates with respect to
the complex structure  and rewrite ()
as






The Jacobi identities  imply that




where





and  is the Levi-Civita connection of the metric .
Collecting the various terms together, we find that



which vanishes identically because  is conformally balanced,
 .
Therefore equations () together with the
Jacobi equations imply the field equations ().


The gauge field equations 

We shall use the result of the previous section to show that
the field equations of the gauge field are satisfied provided that
the Killing-spinor equations () are satisfied.

Assuming that the background  and its deformation
 satisfy the Killing-spinor equations (), the
KT structures  and  are conformally balanced
and the holonomies 
of their  connections are contained in .
In addition both gauge connections  and its deformation  satisfy
the conditions
()-the latter up to linear order in .

Applying the theorem 
proven 
in the previous section, we conclude that the background
 and its deformation
 satisfy the field equations ()-the latter up to
linear order in . Expanding () in    for the background
 and since () is satisfied
at  zeroth order in ,
the linear term in  will vanish identically. Thus
if the background  and its deformation
 satisfy the Killing-spinor equations, then the field equations
() for the gauge potential
are satisfied without additional conditions  on the deformations. The
conditions on the deformation  of the gauge connection  are
_Q_Q_=_  Q_ -
_  Q_ &=&0
h^  F(B)_ + g^ 
(_Q_ -_  Q_) &=&0 ,
where the covariant derivative  is with respect to the gauge connection .
We have derived these by substituting the deformation  of
 in
the Killing-spinor equations () and by collecting the
 terms linear in .


It remains to find whether the Killing-spinor equations for the gaugino or
equivalently () have solutions on a general conformally
balanced KT manifold. It is easy to investigate the case where 
is an abelian connection. However, the non-abelian case is more involved and
so we shall not pursue this further.






(2,0) heterotic compactifications 


The compactification ansa tze for the heterotic string which preserve
(2,0) world-volume supersymmetry and are 
spacetime supersymmetric, are given in ()
with the additional assumption that the internal space  is compact
(The ansatz () was considered in where
it was shown that no warp factor is allowed for the non-compact
part of the metric.  
Therefore, as is easy to see using sigma-model perturbation theory, 
there can be no such warp factor in () either.) .
As we have discussed, such backgrounds are expected to
receive  corrections. Using the machinery  developed
in the previous sections, we shall investigate the deformations
of these backgrounds due to  corrections.


The zeroth-order solution 


As we have explained the requirement for a compactification to
preserve (2,0) world-sheet supersymmetry and  of
spacetime supersymmetry in -dimensions leads to an internal
manifold  with a conformally balanced KT structure and
.

The additional  requirement that  is compact(This assumption
is sufficient for the spectrum in  dimensions to be discrete.) ,
the implicit assumption that all the fields  are smooth on 
and the fact that at zeroth order in  , impose strong restrictions
on the geometry of .
It has been shown in under the above assumptions(
In fact in it was shown that  is Calabi-Yau
even if  provided a certain inequality holds.) 
 that  is  Calabi-Yau ,  and the dilaton  is constant.
In addition at zeroth order in  the gauge connection 
satisfies the Donaldson equations () on the Calabi-Yau manifold .
These data are the starting point of our  expansion.



The Calabi-Yau background 
receives  corrections. The deformation 
  of
  has non-vanishing torsion 
which is not closed, , as required by the
 anomaly-cancellation mechanism.
Note that the zeroth-order term in  vanishes and so   is purely 
first-order in ,
.




The first-order solution 

To find the 
correction  to the Calabi-Yau geometry , we
 have to solve equations (), ()  for the  first-order
deformations .
The deformation  to the dilaton is given in (),
. Similarly,
the deformation  of the torsion is given in ().
The remaining field
and Killing-spinor equations are satisfied without further conditions.

Since for this background the torsion vanishes
at zeroth order in ,  condition
()
arising from  the requirement that , can be rewritten
as
^  h_ -12  _(g^ 
h_ )=0 .
The above equation can be thought of as a gauge-fixing condition
for the deformations associated with infinitesimal diffeomorphisms
of the underlying manifold.
Condition () can always be attained.
To see this, first write () in real coordinates
^j h_ji -14  _i h^j _j=0 .
Suppose that  does not solve (). We shall show  that there is
a  such that  given by
   satisfies
 ().  is determined by
^k _k v_i+12 _i ^k v_k
=^j h_ji -14  _i h^j _j .
First note that the Kernel of the operator on the left-hand-side
of the equation above is zero on an
irreducible  Calabi-Yau manifold. Indeed let  be in
the Kernel. Then




Thus  is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita
connection. Since  is irreducible, there are no parallel one-forms on 
and so the Kernel vanishes.  Therefore equation  () can be
solved for  since the right-hand-side does not vanish, by assumption.



We can also determine the metric moduli of (2,0)
compactifications. Since the -lemma applies
for Calabi-Yau manifolds, the Aeppli group  is
isomorphic to the the Hodge group .
 Thus the dimension of the  moduli space is the Hodge number
 which is the same as the number of  metric moduli of
Calabi-Yau manifolds. Of course one can also take into account the moduli
associated with including in the theory NS two-form gauge
potentials. The latter are harmonic (1,1)-forms. This leads to a
complex moduli space of real dimension . One
concludes that the metric moduli of  Calabi-Yau
(2,0)-compactifications, which are associated  with NS fluxes induced by the
heterotic anomaly, are not  lifted. An effect of the 
heterotic anomaly-cancellation mechanism
is a shift in the origin of the moduli space.

The moduli of the theory associated with deformations of the complex structure
of the underlying Calabi-Yau manifold is not lifted either. The analysis that
we have done using the complex structure  can be repeated with any other
complex structure on the Calabi-Yau manifold. Therefore, we conclude
that the presence of NS flux associated with the heterotic anomaly
cancellation mechanism does not  lift the Calabi-Yau moduli at this
order in  perturbation theory.




The -corrected conifold 


The conifold is a singular non-compact Calabi-Yau threefold.
Here we  apply
the machinery of the previous sections to compute
the  corrections explicitly.

The conifold can  be thought of as a Ricci-flat
cone over a  space, where the latter
is a particular  fibration over .
Let  be  angular
coordinates
parametrising the two spheres , 
be the coordinate on the  fibre and  be
the radial coordinate. The line element of the conifold is
ds^2=g_mn dx^m dx^n&=&d^2
+^29 (d+cos_1 d_1+cos_2 d_2)^2

&+&^26 (sin^2_1 d_1^2+d_1^2)
+^26 (sin^2_2 d_2^2+d_2^2) .
The second term on the right-hand-side is the vertical displacement along the
 fibre whereas the last two terms represent the line element of
. There is a conical singularity at ,
where the  base of the cone shrinks to zero size.
It is useful to note that
 is topologically .


Let us now
consider a deformation ,
where  is hermitian,
h_kl J^  _m J^l  _n =h_mn .
The complex structure  of the conifold is

J^_1  __1 =sin_1&,&    
J^  __1 =-3 cos_1,

J^_2  __2 =sin_2&,&    
J^  __2 =-3 cos_2,

J^_1  __1 =-1sin_1 &,&    
J^  __1 =cot_1,

J^_2  __2 =-1sin_2 &,&    
J^  __2 =cot_2,

J^  _ =-3 &,&    
J^  _ =3  ,and the rest of the components vanish.
Condition () implies that  is of the form,

h_mn dx^m dx^n&=&D [d^2
+^29 (d+cos_1 d_1+cos_2 d_2)^2]

&+&A(sin^2_1 d_1^2+d_1^2)
+C(sin^2_2 d_2^2+d_2^2)

&+&2B sin(sin_1 d_1 d_2-sin_2 d_2 d_1)

&+&2B cos(d_1d_2+sin_1 sin_2 d_1 d_2) .

We  take  to be functions of the
radial coordinate alone.
With this assumption,
it can be seen from the form of most general  metric
given in, that ()
is a foliation of  spaces.

The gauge-fixing condition () is equivalent to

0&=&A+C+32 (A+C)'-112 ^3-23 ^2 F

0&=&B

In order to solve the Einstein equation, we need to find



After some computation, we get

S__1_1 =S__2_2 =sin^2^2 ,  
S__1_1 =S__2_2 =1^2 .
The Einstein equation () 
(or its gauged-fixed version (C.4) of appendix C) 
is then equivalent to the following
set of conditions,

0&=&B

0&=&A+C+^224 (-8D+5D'+^2D")

0&=&6A'+6^2 A"+^2(-4D+5D'+^2D")-3

0&=&A'+A"-C'-C"

Demanding that the total metric be asymptotic to
the conifold in the region
,
the general solution to order  reads

A&=&-116 
(32 -c_1-c_2 log_0  )

B&=&0

C&=&-116 
(32 +c_1+c_2 log_0 )

D&=&-38^2 

where  is a dimensionful constant introduced to make
the constants    dimensionless.
Note that the gauge-fixing condition () is
automatically satisfied by the solution (). Therefore
the solution
is spacetime supersymmetric.

To summarise, the -perturbed metric is

ds^2&=&(1-38^2 ) [d^2
+^29 
(d+cos_1 d_1+cos_2 d_2)^2]

&+&^26 [1-38^2 
(32 -c_1-c_2 log_0 )]
(sin^2_1 d_1^2+d_1^2)

&+&^26 [1-38^2 
(32 +c_1+c_2 log_0 )]
(sin^2_2 d_2^2+d_2^2).

The perturbation is valid in the regime . In
order to be able to extract any information about the behavior of the metric
near the apex (),
the full tower of  corrections would have to
be taken into account as these become important in the sub-stringy
regime . This is clearly beyond the validity of
our analysis. Nevertheless, we can attempt to extrapolate our result to the
region . 
An analysis then reveals that at a radial distance of the order of ,
an  in the  base
shrinks to zero volume.
We therefore find that the
singularity of the conifold persists, although it becomes milder in
the sense that not the entire base shrinks to zero.















The -corrected  -invariant Calabi-Yau metric 

To describe the -invariant Calabi-Yau metric, we
introduce  complex coordinates  and
consider the  invariant Hermitian metric



where , 
 and similarly for the rest.
The metric is Kahler if



where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to .
The Levi-Civita connection one-form is





The holonomy of the above connection is contained .
The metric is Calabi-Yau if and only if the holonomy of the above connection
is in . The connection of canonical bundle is



where . The curvature
of canonical bundle vanishes iff



where  is a constant. The most general solution of this equation is



where  is constant. This metric is the Calabi-Yau metric
on the orbifold  after resolving the singularity
at the origin by replacing with a .
Next we compute  to find




where




and .
After  some computation, we find that



In addition setting



and ,
 we find that   implies
D'-E=-18 C .
Condition () for , gives
2 (n-1) A^-1  E- (n-1) A^-1 D'-(n-1) A^-2  A' D +1 
[A^n-1  (D+r^2 E)]'=0
 .
The supersymmetric deformation can be computed by solving ()
and ().
Substituting for  in (), we find after some algebra that

0=&-&c^2 n(n+1)8r^4n+4  3+ncr^2n  (+cr^2n  )^2 
-c^2(n-1)r^4n+2  1(+cr^2n  ) D

&+& [n-1 (cr^2n  )
+2(+cr^2n  )]D'
+r^2  (+cr^2n  )D" .

We have not been able to obtain a closed form for .
But we can solve the equation perturbatively in a large
distance expansion. The result reads,

E&=&n(c/)^28 r^4n+4  (
n-2+-5n^2+8n+12n+1  (c/)r^2n  +)

D&=&n(c/)^28 r^4n+2  (
32n+1 +n^2-14n-3(2n+1)(3n+1) 
(c/)r^2n  +)

Note that the leading correction to the metric behaves like .


Concluding Remarks 

Compactifications with fluxes lead to lower-dimensional
effective theories which exhibit potentials
lifting some of the moduli.
The relevant flux for (2,0) 
heterotic-string compactifications is the NS three-form .
There are two possibilities. One is to
 allow for a non-vanishing flux at zeroth order in .
Then the internal manifold is either non-compact
or/and some of the fields are singular. We have extensively investigated
the case of Calabi-Yau compactifications where the NS
flux vanishes at zeroth order in .
As we have shown such compactifications develop  a non-vanishing
flux   and a non-constant dilaton at
  first order  in .
In addition, at this order in ,
 the compactifications have the same dimension of moduli space 
as that of the moduli space of 
the Calabi-Yau manifolds at zeroth order in 
 and so there is no lifting of moduli.

The effective lower-dimensional theories  which arise in standard
Calabi-Yau compactifications, i.e. without NS flux,
 may be different from those
with flux. If there is no NS flux 
induced by 
the heterotic anomaly-cancellation mechanism, then it is consistent
to take the lower-dimensional effective action to be 
the standard ten-dimensional N=1 supergravity action. Of course there
will be higher-order  corrections. Nevertheless  it is consistent to 
consider
only the zeroth order in . 
On the other hand, if one wishes to consider
the NS fluxes
induced by the heterotic anomaly-cancellation mechanism,
consistency requires  that curvature square terms in the field equations
and their supersymmetric completion should be considered as well.
These will contribute to the lower-dimensional effective theories.


The other possibility is  to introduce
a non-vanishing  flux at zeroth order in 
and to allow for some fields to be singular
or/and for the internal manifold to be non-compact.
In the case that the  manifold or the fields are singular, one may expect that
these singularities can be resolved by taking 
into account  corrections.
We have seen, for example, that after taking into account the linear order
 correction to the conifold, the metric is less singular but the
singularity is not completely resolved.  In a scenario where the
singularities are removed and the internal manifold remains compact,
some moduli may be lifted and  potentials of the type given in  
 may be generated
in the effective theory
in lower dimensions.

Similar conclusions can be drawn for compactifications of other theories 
with fluxes
in the presence of an anomaly-cancellation mechanism. Such an example
is M-theory. To investigate the consistency of the 
anomaly cancellation
with spacetime supersymmetry as we have done for the heterotic string, one
needs to know the higher-order derivative corrections to  
supergravity and their supersymmetric completions.


It is of interest to speculate on
the geometry of the background ()
after all  corrections are taken into account.
It is expected that such a background is
a Hermitian manifold, based on 
the assumption that (2,0) world-sheet supersymmetry
is preserved in sigma-model perturbation theory.
It is unlikely that the 
supergravity Killing-spinor equations will remain of the
form  (). 
The dependence on the metric and the torsion will change and
higher-curvature terms are expected to appear.
So the conditions for preserving spacetime
supersymmetry will not be simply expressed as  conditions on the holonomy
of the  connection 
and on the Lee form  of the Hermitian geometry.
However, some properties of the underlying manifold  may be preserved.
It is plausible to assume that the manifold  satisfies 
the -lemma
and the canonical bundle is holomorphically trivial. It has been shown
in that Moishezon manifolds with these properties admit a 
connection
with skew-symmetric torsion  and holonomy contained in .
However, it is not apparent that the associated metric is that
which arises after taking into account all  corrections. In addition,
on such non-Kahler Moishezon manifolds 
there is no KT structure  for which the associated  three-form
field strength is closed. Therefore such manifolds 
cannot be used as the starting point of 
the sigma-model perturbation theory.

Useful Formulae for KT Geometry 


Let  be a KT manifold, i.e.  is a hermitian manifold of
complex dimension 
with metric  and complex structure  such that , where
 has skew-symmetric torsion .  In the mathematics literature
 is called the Bismut connection.
 The holonomy of  
is contained in . In complex coordinates, the holonomy
condition requires  which in
turn gives
H_ =-_G_ 
+_G_  .
The rest of the components of the torsion are determined by complex conjugation.
The (3,0) and (0,3) components of  vanish as it can be seen
from the integrability of the complex structure.
 So  is determined
uniquely in terms of the metric and complex structure of .
The Lee form of the KT geometry is



where  is the Kahler form.
In complex coordinates, the Lee form can be written as
_ln (G_ )- G^ 
_G_ 
and .

The connection of the canonical bundle
induced by    is
_i^(+)  _ ^ _i^(+)  _ ^  _ =2i G^ 
_G_ -i G^ _G_ 
and . Let  be the
curvature of the 
 connection . The holonomy of the connection 
is contained in , iff .



A KT manifold is conformally balanced iff there is a function  on 
such that , i.e. the Lee form is exact.
It has been shown in that if
 is a conformally balanced KT manifold and
the holonomy of 
is contained in  (), then
R_ij +14  H^k _il  H^l _jk 
+2_i_j14  J^k _i (dH)_kjmn  ^mn  ,
where  is the Levi-Civita connection of the metric . Note that
we do  not  require  in the above expression.

Our conventions for the curvature
of a connection  are




and the Ricci tensor is .







Lichnerowicz and Laplace operators 

Let  be a Riemannian manifold with associated Levi-Civita connection .
The Lichnerowicz operator  is defined by




So  is the first-order deformation of the Ricci tensor.
A calculation reveals that
_Lh_ij =&-&12 ^2 h_ij - R_ik jl  h^kl 
+12 _i^kh_kj +
12 _j^kh_ki 
&-&12 _i_j h^k _k+12  R_ki  h^k _j+12  R_kj  h^k _i
The Laplacian operator  on a two form  is




On Ricci-flat Kahler manifolds, we can relate the  Lichnerowicz operator
 to the Laplace operator on two-forms
by choosing  the gauge fixing condition



 for infinitesimal diffeomorphisms and by 
using the relation 
 between symmetric (1,1)-tensors and (1,1)-forms. The Hermiticity
 condition for the metric implies that the deformations  of the
 metric are (1,1) tensors.

Note that the above gauge can always be attained.
Suppose that  does not satisfy the gauge.
Assume that there is an infinitesimal diffeomorphism  such that
 
 satisfies the gauge. Then  is determined by the equation



To show that  there is always such a , we must
invert  the above equation. This can be achieved iff
 is orthogonal to the kernel of the
elliptic operator . We rewrite the above equation as



where  and  is the adjoint of .
Of course this equation can be inverted iff the right-hand-side is orthogonal
to harmonic one-forms.  Indeed let  be a harmonic one-form, then






because  is closed.


 Another derivation of the field equations for (2,0) compactifications 

 The first-order corrections  to the background of a Calabi-Yau
 compactification , , can be determined
 by the field equations without using
 the conditions for spacetime supersymmetry. To show
 this, we substitute () in the
field equation () and collect the linear terms in .
Using the fact that at zeroth order in  the geometry is Calabi-Yau,
the equation for the metric gives
_Lh_ij + S_ij  +2_i _jwhere  is the Lichnerowicz
operator (see appendix B).  In this case, we have
_Lh_ij =-12 ^2 h_ij -
 R_ik jl  h^kl +12 _i^kh_kj +
12 _j^k h_ki 
-12 _i_j h^k _k
because  is Calabi-Yau and ,
and
S_ij =14 [ R_iklm  R_j ^klm 
- F_ikab  F_j ^kab ]
The covariant derivative  in () and ()
and the curvature  are  with respect to the Calabi-Yau metric .


To solve equation () with respect to
, we shall exploit the well-known relation between the
Lichnerowicz and Laplace operators
on Calabi-Yau manifolds. There are two ways to do this.
One is to use the scheme dependence
of the two-loop beta function and the other is to impose a gauge fixing condition
on the deformations  of the metric . The latter is common in moduli problems
in order for the deformation  to be orthogonal to the orbits of infinitesimal
diffeomorphisms.
Using the scheme dependence of the two-loop beta function, we can 
arrange so that
the term




is cancelled  by a wave function renormalization, where  is a real number.
Alternatively, one can impose the gauge fixing condition



Provided that we set for the deformation of the dilaton



the remaining equation is
-12 ^2 h_ij - R_ik jl  h^kl +S_ij =0 .
To solve this equation observe that  is a (1,1) symmetric tensor with respect to the
complex structure. This allows us to consider deformations of the metric which
are (1,1) as well, i.e. to take  to be a (1,1) symmetric tensor.
It is well known that on Kahler manifolds there is a 1-1 correspondence between
symmetric (1,1) tensors and (1,1) two-forms. Indeed define the  forms
 and  associated to  and .
Equation () becomes
Y+Z=0
where



is the standard Laplace operator on  (see appendix B). We have
taken into account that Calabi-Yau manifolds are Ricci-flat, .
So it remains to invert the
Laplace operator to determine  in terms of .

To solve the equation () in terms of , we have to show that
 is orthogonal to
the harmonic two-forms of  in the Hodge decomposition with respect to the
Calabi-Yau metric . This can be achieved by relating
the two-loop contribution  to the beta function of the metric, to the
heterotic anomaly . Using



we can show that



Now suppose that . After some computation, we find that



The cancellation of the global anomaly implies that  is exact.
As a consequence the dual two-form  is co-exact and
so it is orthogonal to harmonic two-forms. It remains to show that

is not harmonic.  Observe  that a harmonic function on  is a non-vanishing constant.
Integrating the identity



over the compact manifold  and using that  is exact, it is easy
to see that  is not harmonic.



This result can be easily extended to four- and eight-dimensional
internal manifolds.  The  case has been
investigated in. For
, the computation is similar to . The only difference
is the relation between the two-loop counterterm and the anomaly.


Next we  investigate the field equation of the three-form field strength.
Again substituting () in () and
collecting the terms linear in , we find



or equivalently



where  is the adjoint operator of .
To derive this, we have used the fact that  vanishes at
zeroth order  in . In addition, we have that  ; 
is well-defined because  is exact.
Using the Hodge decomposition, we can write



where  is harmonic and  is a four-form.
Adding the counterterm



the exact three-form  can be eliminated as follows



Thus the field equation is satisfied and .
Alternatively, one can choose  such that .
