We study time dependent solutions in cubic open string field theory
which is expected to describe the configuration of the rolling
tachyon.
We consider the truncated system consisting of component fields
of level zero and two, which are expanded in terms of 
modes.
For studying the large time behavior of the solution we need to know
the coefficients of all and, in particular, large  modes.
We examine numerically the coefficients of the -th mode, and find
that it has the leading -dependence of the form
 multiplied by a peculiar subleading part
with peaks at .
This behavior is also reproduced analytically
by solving simplified equations of motion of the tachyon system.




Introduction 

Recently the time dependent decay of an unstable D-brane has been
one of the most active subjects in string theory.
The unstable D-brane evolves in time
as the tachyon field rolls down to the bottom of the potential
corresponding to the stable closed string vacuum.
Sen proposed a boundary conformal field theory (BCFT)
which describes this time dependent process.
This BCFT is exactly solvableand he found that in the limit of vanishing string coupling
the system evolves to a pressureless gas called tachyon
matter.
Since tachyon matter is classically stable, it could be applied to
cosmology as inflaton, and the tachyon matter cosmology has attracted
great interest.

Besides such cosmological applications, time dependent solutions
themselves are of importance in string theory.
For they are expected to reveal new nonperturbative aspects of string
dynamics.
Much work has been done for the study of the rolling tachyon
solutions using various formulations such as conformal field theory,
effective field theory, boundary string field theory,
supergravity, and so on

.
However, there are many problems left unresolved.
For example, closed string emission and its back reaction in the
process of rolling.

In this paper, we study time dependent solutions describing the
rolling tachyon in cubic string field theory (CSFT).
We construct time dependent solutions in truncated CSFT
and examine whether the solutions have the properties of
the rolling tachyon.
The desirable properties are as
follows:
 
There is a one-parameter family of solutions.
This parameter  corresponds to the initial value
of tachyon field.
For , the tachyon stays at the unstable perturbative vacuum:
t(x;)=0.
There is a specific value  of .
At  the tachyon field is
independent of time and stays at the tachyon vacuum:
t(x^0;_c)=t_c.
For , the tachyon evolves in time and
asymptotically approaches the tachyon vacuum :
t(x;0 )=t_c.

We expand the component fields in
terms of  (and ) and solve the equations of
motion for the modes.
For example, in the truncated system of only the level zero tachyon
field , we express it as
t(x^0)=_n=1 ^ t_nnx^0,
and solve the equations of motion for  () by taking 
as a given parameter corresponding to the marginal deformation
parameter in the full CSFT system.(
See for approaches to solving the
differential equations of the component fields without using the
mode expansion.
) 
However, if we truncate the summation in t=sum  at  as in
the modified level truncation scheme, the solution
diverges like  as .
A hint on avoiding this divergent behavior is found in the calculation
of the coefficient  of the closed string tachyon in the
rolling tachyon boundary state.
There, an infinite summation of   gives a finite value at
 by analytic continuation:
f(x^0)=1+2_n=1 ^ (- )^n nx^0=
1 1+ e^x^0  +1 1+ e^-x^0  -1 .
Moreover, at a specific value of the parameter ;
, the summation becomes a constant,
which is a desirable property for the rolling tachyon solution.
This example suggests that, for getting a convergent function at
, we have to obtain the coefficients 
for all, and in particular, large  and carry out the infinite
summation of t=sum .

In this paper, we first solve numerically the equation of motion of
 to study its  -dependence. We find that  has a leading
-dependence of the form  with
 being proportional to the parameter . Besides this leading
-dependence,  has a peculiar subleading part with peaks at
.
Then we carry out analytical study of the equation of motion of .
Since the original equation of motion is too complicated to be solved
analytically, we consider approximate equation of motion valid for a
large . This equation is further deformed to a simplified one which
still maintains the essential features of the original equation.
In fact, this simplified equation can be solved analytically at
special values of  to reproduce the behavior of  found by
numerical analysis.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
In sec. 2, we present the CSFT action and the equation of motion
of . In sec. 3, we carry out the numerical analysis of  and
also the level two modes, and find their -dependence.
Then in sec. 4, the equation of motion of  is examined
analytically to reproduce their -dependence found in sec. 3.
The final section (sec. 5) is devoted to a summary and discussions.
In the appendix, we present technical details used in sec. 4.


CSFT action and the equation of motion 

The action of cubic string field theory for bosonic open string
takes the formS=-1 ^2 (
12
+ 13 ()),
where  is the BRST operator and  is the star product
between two string fields.
The open string field  contains component fields
corresponding to all the states in the first-quantized string Fock space.
For more details of CSFT and its application to tachyon condensation,
see and the references therein.
First let us keep only the tachyon field  in ,
.
The truncated action including only the tachyon field is
S=1 ^2 d^26 x(
12  t(x)(+1) t(x)
-13 (^(1/3) t(x))^3),
with
,9/2 /2^6=2.192 .
We use the convention of  throughout this paper.
Later we shall take into account of the level two fields.

In the following we are interested in the time dependent and
spatially homogeneous solution  to the equation of motion
derived from ():
(_0^2-1)t(x^0)+^1-_0^2/3 
(^-_0^2/3 t(x^0))^2=0.
As we mentioned in sec. 1,
we expand the tachyon field in terms of 
following.
Here, we do not adopt the modified level truncation scheme
, but take into account of all the modes:
t(x^0)=_n=0 ^ t_n nx^0 .
Substituting this into the equation of motion eq_t ,
we have the following equations for each :
 
which are respectively the equations of motion of ,  and
 ().


 From the BCFT analysis of rolling tachyon,
it is expected that the full CSFT keeping all the component fields in
 has a rolling solution with one free parameter
corresponding to the initial value of the tachyon field at  .
However, in the approximate analysis with finite number of component
fields, we no longer have such a free parameter.
Therefore, in our analysis we treat  as a given parameter and
solve eq_t0  and eq_tn  for
 ().
In the exact CSFT, we can in principle adopt any  as the free
parameter.
However, in our approximate analysis the result depends on choice of
the free parameter.
The present choice is natural since,
in the case without the interaction in eq_t , the solution is
given by  with  being arbitrary.

Before starting the numerical analysis of , we shall mention
that the parameter  has an upper bound  above which
eq_t0  and eq_tn  have no real solutions.
To understand this fact it is sufficient to consider only 
neglecting other  with , since they are negligibly
small compared with  as we shall see in later sections.
Solving eq_t0  with  (), we have two branches of
solutions,
t_0^() (t_1)=1 2 (11-
(t_1  )^2 ) ,
with  given by
1 2  ^-2/3 
=0.419 .
The solutions  and  are those connected with the
tachyon vacuum  and the unstable perturbative vacuum
, respectively, and  is the rolling solution we are
interested in.
Both  are real only in the region .


Numerical analysis 

In this section we shall carry out numerical analysis of the rolling
solutions in CSFT. In sec. 3.1, we solve numerically the equation of
motion of only the level zero tachyon field .
Then in sec. 3.2 we extend our analysis to the system with level two
fields.

Numerical analysis for tachyon field 

As we mentioned in the previous section, we solve numerically the
equations of motion eq_t0  and eq_tn  for
 and  () for a given value of .
Since numerical calculation cannot be done for an infinite number of
variables , we put  for  with sufficiently
large  and solve eq_t0  and eq_tn  for .
Here, we take  and obtain the solution 
() by Newton's method starting with the point

(namely, we are considering the solution which is reduced to the
perturbative vacuum in the limit ).
We have obtained  at discrete points
 and .
There exists no real solutions for , which is
consistent with the simplified analysis of t0pm .

Then, let us assume that the -dependence of  at each value of

numerical solution .
This assumption of tnfit  will be justified by analytical

These results show that

Fig.  (with ) itself tells that

have  () and  ().
These results strongly suggest that  approaches a constant
which is equal to one in the limit .
As for , the proportionality constant ( for )
for other values of  are  () and  ().
The proportionality constant gradually decreases as  becomes
larger, and the value at  predicted by the fitting using

The value of  at  which is close to the critical

well satisfied by the solution connected to the perturbative vacuum.

Inclusion of level 2 fields 

We have carried out the same kind of analysis as in the previous
subsection by including the level two fields.
Taking into account of spatial rotational symmetry,
twist symmetry and the invariance under ,
the string field  in the Siegel gauge
with component fields up to level two is expanded as
follows:
 
where , ,  and  are even functions of  and hence
are expanded by ; 
 (, , , ), while  is an
odd function and is expanded by ;
.
These five fields are all hermitian.
We have used the level  action(
Here, we assign level zero to  and level two to
, ,  and  for all .
) 
in our calculation.

In this numerical analysis, we adopted  as the cutoff of the
mode number  for all the five fields and solved the equation of
motion of each mode for a given value of .
Then, fitting the solution  by tnfit , we obtained
 and , which are shown in figs. and .(
In obtaining  and  by fitting, we omitted
,  and .
Inclusion of them in the fit leads to
 and  with strange -dependence
since ,  and  change their signs at ,

The critical value of  above which there is no real solution
is  in the present case, which is larger than that in
the purely  system.
Fig.  is consistent with our previous result
xisimeq1 , .
 From fig.  we have
(t_1)0.50 t_1.
In particular, the value of  at the critical  is
, which is about three times larger than
that in the purely  system of sec. 3.1.
The -dependences of other modes  ()
are similar to that of .

In our level  analysis with ,
the subleading part  subt_n  does not show such
characteristic behavior as in figs. .
This could be due to that  is not sufficiently large.

Analytical consideration 

In this section, we would like to understand analytically the
-dependence of  found in the previous section,
namely, xisimeq1 , betaproptot1  and the peculiar
behavior of the subleading part  given
by fig. .

Let us consider the equation of motion eq_tn  for large .
We assume that the solution  is given by
t_n=-(-1)^n2   g_n^-(2/3)cn^2 (n1),
where  is a constant and  has a weaker -dependence than
the leading term .
Concretely, we expect that  for .
The front factor  is simply for the sake of later
convenience. Note that, if  is a solution, so is .

We rewrite eq_tn  into
(n^2-1)t_n+^1-(2/3)n^2 (2 t_0t_n+Y_n+Z_n)=0,
where  and  are defined by
 
Substituting the ansatz ansatz  to  and ,
we obtain
 
where the summations with respect to  run over integers
(half-an-odd integers) when  is even (odd).
Since the summation in  is convergent in the limit ,
we have
Y_n^-(2/3)(c/2 -1/4)n^2 ,
(n1).
On the other hand, the large  behavior of  is
Z_n^-(2/3)(c/2 -1/4)n^2 ^-(2/3)(1+2c)(1+n/2)^2 
^-(2/3)cn^2 ,
(n1).
Therefore, we have
Y_n Z_n t_n,
(n1),
and we can neglect  and  in the second term of
eq_tn2  for a large .
The constant  is determined by the requirement that the first
term  of eq_tn2  and the
leading part  of
the second term have the same large  behavior:
c=32.
Therefore, the equation of motion eq_tn2  for  is reduced
to
g_n=
1 n^2-1 _k=1-n/2 ^n/2-1 ^-(8/3)k^2 
g_n 2 -k g_n 2 +k .
Although eq_gn  has been derived for a sufficiently large ,
let us assume that it is valid for all .
Then, since the RHS of eq_gn  is given in terms of
 with  smaller than ,
eq_gn  determines  recursively once we fix
.
In fact, numerical analysis shows that eq_gn  reproduces the
peculiar subleading behavior of fig. .

For analytic evaluation of , let us make a further simplification
on eq_gn  which can still reproduce the behavior of
  observed in sec. 3.
This simplification is to keep only the term with the smallest
 in the summation of eq_gn  by regarding
that  is sufficiently small:
g_n=1 n^2-1 cases 
(g_n/2 )^2 &(n:even )

g_(n-1)/2 g_(n+1)/2 & (n:odd )
,
with
-2/3 =32 27 .
Eq. eq_simple  is still too complicated to be solved
analytically for a generic . However, we can obtain the solution
 for specific values of ;
 ()
and  ().
These  are of the form  and
 in the binary notation.
For , eq_simple  gives
 
which in the special case of  is the equation for .
Then, using again eq_simple ,  on the RHS of
11a  is given as
g_2^a+1 -1 
= (2^a+1 -1)^2-1 g_2^a g_2^a-1 
=_k=0 ^a-1  (2^a-k+1 -1)^2-1 
_g_2^a-  ,
and the final factor  in g2^(a+1)-1  is
expressed in terms of 
using 11a  with  and .
Completing the calculations we obtain  in a
closed form as a function of  (see appendix ).
In particular, for a large  we have
g_n=2^m(2-2^-a ) =
16(g_1 G_a )^n
(n^2-1 7 +O (n^-2 )).
In gna ,  depends on only  and is given by
 
where  and  are defined by
 

Similarly, for  we have
g_n=2^m(1+2^-b )  = 16(g_1 G _b )^n
(n^2 -1 7 +O (n^-2 )),
where  is given by
G _b=
(
32^(b^2+3b+8)/2  ^b T _b^2 e^-S _b 
_k=0 ^b-1 (2^k+1)
_p=0 ^b-2 
_q=0 ^b-p-2 (2^2(b-p-q-1) -1)^2^q 
)^1/T _b ,
with
 
In G  and wtG , the products  with
 are defined to be equal to one.
For example, the products in G  are missing for .

Let us see the behaviors of  and .
First, we have
G_0=G_G _0=G _e^-S_0 =13.604 .
The equality of these four quantities is natural since ,
,  and  all correspond to the points of the
same type . The value  is independent of .
Next, figs.  and  show
 (dots) and  (circles).
The horizontal axis is  for  and
 for  (recall that  for ,
and  for ).
Since  and  corresponds to the same , we have
.
The difference between figs.  and is that we have used the original value  of eta  in
the former,
while the smaller value  has been adopted in the latter (see
below for the reason why we consider  different from
eta ).

Here we use the original value .

(205,75)  
file=g_eta-1.eps, width=7cm 

 (dots) and  (circles) as functions of 
calculated by adopting . 




Substituting gna  and 
into ansatz , we get for 
t_n=2^m(2-2^-a ) 
=-32  (-^2  2 G_a t_1)^n
^-n^2 (n^2-1 7 +O (n^-2 )).
Similarly from gmb , we obtain , which is
given by tn=32  with  replaced by .
Let us compare this expression of  with the results of our
numerical analysis of sec. 3.1. There  was given as (we have put
)
t_n=-_n(-)^n^-n^2 .
In sec. 3.1, we first determined  (and ) by fitting 
using tn=htn  with  treated as -independent
quantity . We found that the subleading part  has a
peculiar -dependence of fig. .
The correspondence between tn=32  and tn=htn  should
be as follows:
 
where  is the "average value" of .
Here we can treat only the special points of the form
 and . However,  should
be regarded as an average of  and  over all  points
assuming that the formula like tn=32  holds for a generic .

Let us consider  of betaana .
If we take , which is a reasonable value as seen from
fig. , we have .
This is close to the proportionality constant of 
determined numerically in sec. 3.1 (see below betaproptot1 ).

Eq. subtana  cannot reproduce the peak
behavior of fig.  if we adopt as  the original
value eta , since  and  has minima at
points a little off the points  as seen from fig. .
However, if we take a smaller value  as in fig. ,
subtana  does reproduce the desired peaks at 
since, in particular,   and  take the smallest value at
these points. The critical value of  below which  and
 have minimum at  is .
One would think that adopting  different from the original
value eta  is groundless.
However, there is no reason to stick to the original value eta 
in solving eq_simple 
since we have made two steps of approximations (the first is
the large  approximation and the second is that of
) in reaching eq_simple  from the original
equation of motion.
It is expected that, by incorporating the effects in making the
approximations, the "effective value" of  in eq_simple 
is reduced from the original one.


Summary and discussions 

In this paper, we studied the time dependent and spatially homogeneous
solution of the truncated version of cubic string field theory.
We expanded the component fields in terms of  modes, wrote
down the equations of motion of the modes, and solved them both
numerically and analytically.
Our finding in this paper is that the tachyon modes have the leading
-dependence of tnfit  multiplied by the subleading
dependence with peaks at .

Let us return to the question posed in sec. 1: what the tachyon
profile would be if we carry out summations over all modes.
First, assuming that  is simply given by its leading part
tnfit  with  for all , the profile 
is given by
t(x^0)=t_0-A_n=1 ^^-n^2 (-)^n
nx^0 .
Unfortunately,
this function does not have a desirable behavior as a rolling
tachyon solution. It is an oscillating function of  which grows
like  for large
.(This is seen from the formula






with  and  identified with  and ,
respectively.
) 

The function sum1 , however, has other apparently equivalent
expressions. Rewriting  in sum1  into
 and moving it outside the summations,
we obtain the second expression:
t(x^0)=t_0+A-A 2 ^-_0^2 (
1 1+e^x^0  +1 1+e^-x^0  ),
with  defined by
.
However, the limit  does not seem to exist since,
as  becomes larger, sum2  becomes rapidly oscillating with
growing amplitude for intermediate values .

The third definition of  is obtained by reexpanding the
quantity in the parenthesis of sum2  in terms of the power
series of  and then moving  inside the
series:
t(x^0)=t_0+A 2 -A 2 _n=1 ^^-n^2 (-1)^n(^n-^-n )e^-nx^0 .
This function has a convergent limit as .
However, it is not a monotonic function of , and what is worse,
its derivative at  is not equal to zero in spite of the fact
that we started with  modes (see fig. ).
 
 
(207,152)  
file=exp_e-nx.eps, width=7cm 



at .  

The origin of the phenomenon that apparently equivalent expressions of
 give completely different functions is the fact that the
insertion of  makes any series with finite radius of
convergence into another series with infinite radius of convergence.
This problem is related to the long standing problem of how to treat
the infinite derivative operators like   in string
field theories.

The above argument shows that the leading part tnfit  alone
cannot give desirable tachyon profiles.
Inclusion of the subleading part  subt_n  could
lead to  with a desirable profile.
For studying this possibility, we have to solve the equation of motion
to obtain analytically the  subleading part  for all  and
carry out the summation over .
However, it is very likely that the problem of 
persists even if we take into account the subleading part.
Another possible way of getting a desirable tachyon profile would be
to claim that the tachyon profile should be given by
 rather than  itself:
this new  is equal to  in the translationally invariant
case, and it gives a monotonic and convergent profile for  of
sum2 .
Besides the tachyon profile itself, we have to study the time
dependence of other physical quantities such as the energy-momentum
tensor.

In this paper we have studied time-dependent solutions in truncated
CSFT. It is interesting to construct time-dependent exact solutions of
the full CSFT.
The tachyon vacuum solution of would be a
staring point of the construction.
Study of time dependent solutions in vacuum string field theory
 is also an interesting research subject.

In this appendix we complete solving eq_simple  for  at
  and deriving the expression gna .
The derivation of  at  is quite similar.

For  we have 11a , g2^(a+1)-1 
and
g_2^a-  
=_k=0 ^a-1 (2^a-2^k 
(g_1)^2^a-  .
Substituting g2^(a+1)-1  and calc_2  into
11a  we obtain a closed expression for :
 
which is valid for any  and  ().
For obtaining the approximate expression gna , we rewrite the
first product in gnany  into
_k=0 ^m-a-1 
(1 (2^m+1-k -2^m-a-k )^2 -1 )^2^k 
=_k=0 ^m-a-1 (n^22^-2k )^-2^k 
_m-a-1 (1-n^-2  2^2 )^-2^ .
The first product on the RHS of dodemo1  is given by
_k=0 ^m-a-1 (n^22^-2k )^-2^k 
=2^4 n^2[(4 T_a)^2/T_a ]^-n ,
and the second product is evaluated for a large  as follows:
 
Plugging dodemo1  with dodemo2  and dodemo3  into
gnany  and rearranging other factors in gnany , we get
gna .
