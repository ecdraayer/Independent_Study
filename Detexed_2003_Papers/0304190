Abstract
A result from Palmer, Beatty and Tracy suggests that the two-point
function of certain spinless scaling fields in a free Dirac theory
on the Poincare disk can be described in terms of Painleve VI
transcendents. We complete and verify this description by fixing
the integration constants in the Painleve VI transcendent
describing the two-point function, and by calculating directly in
a Dirac theory on the Poincare disk the long distance expansion
of this two-point function and the relative normalization of its
long and short distance asymptotics. The long distance expansion
is obtained by developing the curved-space analogue of a form
factor expansion, and the relative normalization is obtained by
calculating the one-point function of the scaling fields in
question. The long distance expansion in fact provides part of the
solution to the connection problem associated with the Painleve
VI equation involved. Calculations are done using the formalism of
angular quantization. April 2003


Introduction 

Quantum Field Theory (QFT) in curved space-time is a subject of
great interest which has been studied from many viewpoints (see
for instance). The main goal of QFT is the
reconstruction of a set of correlation functions in which is
embedded the physical information provided by the theory. Such a
reconstruction is an important problem for QFT on curved
space-time, where the structure of the theory is more subtle. A
simple but non-trivial curved space-time with Euclidean signature
is the Poincare disk. It is maximally symmetric, which allows
some techniques on two-dimensional flat space to be generalized to
this space, and has a negative Gaussian curvature. The effect of a
negative curvature is interesting to study: as was argued in
, a negative curvature can be used as an infrared
regulator for Euclidean QFT.

In two-dimensional flat space, a class of non-trivial correlation
functions can be studied by their relation to the problem of
isomonodromic deformations. Correlators of certain
scaling fields in a free massive Dirac theory are tau functions
 for the isomonodromic deformation problem
associated to some Painleve equations: they can be expressed in
terms of Painleve transcendents. The scaling fields in question,
, are spinless,
-neutral and have scaling dimension . They are not
mutually local with respect to the Dirac field. Their mutual
locality index with the Dirac field is , that is, the
Dirac field  takes a factor, ,
when continued counterclockwise around the field . Their
physical interest stems in particular from the fact that
correlators of some of these scaling fields are simply related to
the scaling limit of correlators of local variables in the Ising
model.

In, the authors generalized the method of isomonodromic
deformation to the study of determinants of the Dirac operator on
the Poincare disk. Their results suggest that the two-point
function of scaling fields  in a Dirac theory on the
Poincare disk can be expressed in terms of Painleve VI
transcendents. The general form of the Painleve VI differential
equation is: &&  w" - 12( 1w + 1w-1  +
1w-s  ) (w')^2 + (1s + 1s-1  +
1w-s )w' 
&& = w(w-1)(w-s) s^2(1-s)^2  (
(1-4^2)s(s-1) 2(w-s)^2  - (2w^2 
        + (s-1) (w-1)^2  + ^2 2 )
painleveintro where  and the primes mean
derivatives with respect to . There are four parameters:
. For the description of the
two-point function  in the free Dirac
theory on the Poincare disk, with fermion mass  and Gaussian
curvature , the parameters are fixed to ,
,  and . The two-point
function is then identified with the associated tau function
, with  simply related to the geodesic distance
 between the points  and :



Up to normalization, the tau function is given by:
tau 
    d ds  (s) &=& s(1-s) 4w(1-w)(w-s)  ( w'-1-w 1-s  )^2 - ^2 w-s  

    &&  +  ^2 4(1-s)w  + ^2 w 4s(1-s)  - ^2 4s 
        + 4^2- ^2 - ^2 4(1-s)  .
This description for the correlator needs to be completed and to
be compared with direct calculation in the Dirac theory on the
Poincare disk. In order to complete it, one must supply
appropriate integration constants specifying the Painleve
transcendent that describes the correlator. First, the exponent
 in the short distance power law of the two-point
function, norm 
    _(x) __+(x,y)^2      at   xy ,
specifies the exponent in the asymptotic behavior of  near the critical point :
ws0 
    w Bs^+  at   s0,
where  is some constant and where we must have .
Second, the cluster property of the two-point function,
leadinglongdist 
    _(x) _= __F((x,y) 2R ) ,
      
    _t   F(t) = 1,
specifies, for , the exponent in the asymptotic behavior of  near the critical point :
ws1 
    1-w A (1-s)^1+2    at   s1,
where again,  is some constant.

One can expect that the exponents in ws0  and ws1  form a
set of integration constants fixing the Painleve transcendent.
However, one doesn't know a priori  that there exists a
solution to the Painleve equation with both behaviors ws0 
and ws1 . In addition, even if such a solution exists, this
set is not the most convenient. One cannot use it for instance to
provide initial conditions for numerically solving the
differential equation painleveintro . It is more appropriate
to fix the full expansion of the Painleve transcendent near the
singular point , that is, to specify the constant  in
ws1 . Fixing this constant is part of the solution to the
connection problem for the particular Painleve VI equation that
we are considering, that is, the problem of relating the behaviors
of the Painleve transcendent near its various critical points.
The expansion of the Painleve transcendent near  is
directly related to the long distance expansion of the two-point
function: Flarged 
    F(t) = 1 -
    A (+)(+(2+1)^2  4^2+1  e^-(4+2)t  +
    O( e^-(4+4)t ).
To our knowledge, the theory of Painleve VI equations
painleveintro  in the case  provides no expression for
 in terms of the exponents in ws0  and ws1 . We
calculated  by evaluating directly in a free massive Dirac
theory on the Poincare disk the long distance expansion of the
two-point function: A 
    A = () ((+) (1+    (+(1+ 
    ^2 (1+2)^2 
The asymptotics ws0  can also serve as initial condition
once  is known, although it is numerically not as efficient.
From results by Jimbo concerning Painleve VI equations,
one can calculate the constant  (see section 7) - this is
another part of the solution to the connection problem.

Another important quantity concerning the two-point function that
is not provided by the theory of Painleve VI equations is an
expression relating the normalization of the leading long distance
asymptotics of the two-point function to that of its leading short
distance asymptotics. Comparing norm  and
leadinglongdist , one sees that the relation between
normalizations can be obtained by calculating the one-point
function . Notice that the condition norm  fixes
the normalization of the scaling fields . This
normalization being fixed, the one-point function  is
unambiguous. By a simple generalization of calculations done on
flat space in, we found




The long distance asymptotics of the two-point function is
obtained by a "form factor" expansion, that is, an expansion
obtained by inserting between the two operators in an appropriate
vacuum expectation value a resolution of the identity on an
appropriate Hilbert space. Actual calculations of form factors on
this Hilbert space are done in the formalism of angular
quantization. More precisely, matrix elements of operators
corresponding to the scaling fields  between the vacuum
and an excited state are evaluated through appropriate traces on
the Hilbert space of angular quantization, following ideas from
. The one-point function  is
similarly evaluated through appropriate traces on the Hilbert
space of angular quantization.

The plan of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we briefly
recall standard results concerning the free Dirac fermion on the
Poincare disk. In section 3 we express the long distance
expansion of the two-point function as a form factor expansion
using canonical quantization. In section 4 we evaluate, up to
normalization, the form factors of the scaling fields  by
calculating appropriate traces on the Hilbert space of angular
quantization, and in section 5 we compute the one-point function
, which specifies the normalization of the form
factors. In section 6 we discuss the long distance expansion of
the two-point function, and finally in section 7 we briefly
elaborate on the description of for the two-point
function in terms of a Painleve VI transcendent and clarify our
results in this context.

Free Dirac fermion on the Poincare disk 

With appropriate complex coordinates , the
Poincare disk can be brought to the region  in the complex -plane. For a Gaussian curvature
 the metric is then specified by



The metric is  invariant. The transformation of coordinates corresponding to the group element
 is



The geodesic distance  between points  and  on
the Poincare disk is given by
geod 
    (x_1,x_2) = 2R  ( z_1-z_2 1-z_1z _2  ).
The free massive Dirac action with fermion mass  in this system of coordinates is
theory 
    A  = dx  dy   (^_+ ^_+ 2 1-z^2 ) ,
where as in the introduction , and ,
. We choose the Dirac matrices as



The two-point function that we are interested in can be represented by the appropriately regularized
Euclidean functional integral
pint 
    _(x) _= _F _,[D D ] e^-A  .
The integration is over the space  of field configurations vanishing on the boundary of the disk
and such that  acquire phases when continued counterclockwise around the points  and :
F _,l 
    around  x:   e^2i  , e^-2i   

    around  y:  e^2i e^-2i . .qp Hilbert space 

An expansion of the functional integral pint  for large
geodesic distance between the points  and  is most
conveniently obtained by using the operator formalism. We will
construct a Hilbert space  on which this functional
integral is represented by a vacuum expectation value
, where  is a
 invariant vacuum implementing vanishing boundary
conditions and where the fields  and  act
on  as operators implementing the quasi-periodicity
conditions qp . The symbol  here denotes an appropriate
"time"-ordering, described below. The large distance expansion
will be obtained by inserting between the fields  and
 a resolution of the identity in terms of a basis of
states that diagonalize a non-compact subgroup of the 
isometry group of the Poincare disk.

We define the Hilbert space  by quantizing the theory on
curves that are orbits of the non-compact subgroup :
isoK 
    : g_q = cc  (q) & (q) 
 (q) & (q) , q.
Translations in the "time" direction, perpendicular to
these curves, are not isometries, so that the Hamiltonian is not
stationary. Translations in the "space" direction, along these
curves, are isometries, and a basis for  will be obtained
by diagonalizing the generator of such translations. In order to
construct , we first map the Poincare disk onto the
strip (see Figure ):



with




 
mapping from the Poincare disk to the strip. Lines with
an arrow represent orbits of .  The action theory  for the fermion fields 
 on the strip is



where . Elements  of the
subgroup  are translations parallel to the strip: 
, so that the quantization space is specified by
the curves  The coordinate  is the
Euclidean "time". Correlation functions of local operators are
expressed as vacuum expectation values of "time"-ordered
products, for instance




where the "time"-ordering  means that operators have to be
ordered form left to right in decreasing values of their variable
. The Hilbert space  is a module for the
canonical equal-"time" anti-commutation relations



where now ,
 are fermion operators acting on
, related on different "time" slices  by
the equations of motion. The vacuum state  is
 invariant, and satisfies the conditions that the fermion
operators vanish on it at early "times"  and
on its dual  at late "times" :
bcop  c      __-/4  _s(_,_)vac =
    __-/4  _s^(_,_)vac = 0 

    __/4  vac_s(_,_) =
    __/4  vac_s^(_,_) = 0.
A basis for the Hilbert space  diagonalizing the subgroup
 is obtained by considering a module for appropriate modes
,  of the Fermion operators
, , where
 represents the  charge. These modes appear in an
expansion in terms of partial waves satisfying the equations of
motion and diagonalizing the spin- action of the subgroup
: pwave 
    _s(_,_) &=& d ()  (
        A_-^() e^i_  P _-(,_) + A_+() e^-i_  P_+(,_) )

    _s^(_,_) &=& d ()  (
        A_+^() e^i_  P _+(,_) + A_-() e^-i_  P_-(,_) ) ,
where the integrations are from  to . We
choose the measure meas 
    () = (12 + + i 2) (12 + - i 2) 
            2(12+)^2 
in order for the partial waves to be entire functions of the
spectral parameter ; this analytical property will be used
later. The solutions for the partial waves can be written:
pwaveexpr 
    P_+(,_) = c 
    2^-2e^-i 2( + 2) 
        (1+e^4i_ )^e^_ 
        F(,12+ 2;1+2;1+e^4i_ ) 

    2^-2e^-i 2( +12+i 2) 
        (1+e^4i_ )^e^-_ 
        F(,12++i 2;1+2;1+e^4i_ )
    and p2 
    P _(,_) = (P_(,-_))^,
    P_-(,_) = (P_+(,_))^t ,
where  means transpose, and where  is
Gauss's hypergeometric function on a Riemann sheet delimited by
the branch cut , with 
. With this choice of solutions, the partial waves
 vanish on the upper boundary 
 of the strip, and  vanish on the
lower boundary  of the strip.

The canonical anti-commutation relations for the fermion operators
imply the following anti-commutation relations for the modes:
Aac 
    A_ (), A^_= 1()  (_,    A_ (), A_= A_ ^(), A_= 0 .
The Hilbert space is the Fock space over this algebra, and
the asymptotic conditions bcop  specify the vacuum :



which we normalize to . A complete basis is given
by basis 
    _1,,_n__1,,_n  =
    A^__1 (_1) A^__n (_n) vac
for a given ordering of the 's, for instance the
"in-ordering" .

The states constructed diagonalize the subgroup :




as well as the  charge, with eigenvalue
. Here and below we use the notation 
for representing the action of the group element  on the space
. These states can be used to obtain a resolution of the
identity on :





where states with different orderings of 's than the
in-ordering  are given by the same expression
basis  in terms of modes. They differ from states with
in-ordering by a sign through the anti-commutation relations
Aac .

On the Hilbert space , the scaling fields  act
as appropriately regularized exponentials of line integrals of the
 current: scalingfieldPsi 
    _(x) ([
        2 i _C _x  dx^_,  ^    ]),
where  is a path from the position  to the
boundary of the disk and  is the representation map on
the space  (for a precise definition of the action of
similar scaling fields on the standard Hilbert space of a Dirac
theory on flat background, see for instance). The
resolution of the identity on  then gives the long
geodesic distance expansion of the two-point function 
. Defining
the function Fff 
    F_(_1,,_n)__1,,_n      vac_(0)_1,,_n__1,,_n ,
we have genexp 
    _(x)_&=& _n=0 ^  1n!  __1,,_n      (_j=1 ^n d_j (_j)) 

&&  F_(_1,,_n)__1,,_n 
        (F_-_1,,_n )^*
    e^-i(_1++_n) (x,y) 2R   .
In order to obtain this formula, one first brings  to the
origin and  to the real axis inside the Poincare disk; this
can always be done by  invariance of the correlator.
Since the subgroup  generates geodesic translations along the
real axis inside the Poincare disk, matrix elements of the
operator  are related to those of  by an
exponential factor involving the geodesic distance .
Using  invariance again, one can replace this by
 for the correlator of fields at arbitrary points 
and . In the next section we calculate the matrix elements
, which
we call "form factors" of the scaling fields .

Angular quantization and form factors 

In order to construct form factors of local fields in quantum
integrable models, in the authors used the idea of
embedding the Hilbert space  of a quantum field theory in
two-dimensional flat space-time into a tensor product



of the Hilbert space of angular quantization  and its
dual . In angular quantization, the Hamiltonian is
taken as the generator of rotations around a given point. Form
factors of local fields can then be constructed as traces on the
angular Hilbert space . We will make a similar
construction in order to obtain the matrix elements
. The
angular Hamiltonian will be taken as the generator of rotations
around the center of the Poincare disk; it is the generator for
the compact subgroup of the  isometry group of the
Poincare disk.

We first briefly develop the formalism of angular quantization
 for our theory. Angular quantization is done in
conformal polar coordinates , where  is the
Euclidean "time" and : cylcoord 
    z=e^+i , z  = e^The fermion fields 
in these coordinates enter the Dirac action as cylact 
    A  = _0^2  d_- ^0 d( ^_+ ^_    -  ()  ) ,
where  and
 are, respectively, the same matrices as
. The angular Hamiltonian derived from this
action is hamilt 
    H_A = _- ^0 d:^^(^_-  () ) : ,
where  and  are now operators
on the angular Hilbert space  satisfying the canonical
anti-commutation relation




The -dependent mass term in the Hamiltonian hamilt 
produces a "mass barrier" effect somewhat similar to the effect
of the mass term in the theory on flat space; it
prevents the fermions from approaching too much the boundary of
the disk. More precisely, it imposes vanishing asymptotic
conditions for the fermion fields when  (such
asymptotic conditions are in fact allowed for all ). With
these asymptotic conditions, the Hamiltonian is diagonalized by
the decomposition mode 
    (,) = _- ^  d 2   c__() e^-  ,
    ^(,) = _- ^d 2   c_^_^() e^ 
in terms of partial waves



with unu 
    u_&=& (1+)(12+(1+2)(        e^i (1-e^2 )^  F(,12++i;1+2;1-e^2 ) 

vnu 
    v_&=& - i (1+)(12+(1+2)(        e^-i (1-e^2 )^  F(,12+2 ),
where  is Gauss's hypergeometric function on its
principal branch. In mode , the operators 
satisfy the canonical anti-commutation relations



The angular Hilbert space  is the fermionic Fock space
over this algebra, with vacuum vector  defined by



With an appropriate normal-ordering, the Hamiltonian takes the
form




We now consider the embedding 
 that will allow us to calculate form factors
of scaling fields
. The
embedding is described by identifying vectors in the Hilbert space
 with endomorphisms on the angular Hilbert space 
: embed 
    _1,,_n__1,,_n  a__1 (_1) a__n (_n) e^-H_A ,
where the operators  are to
be determined. Notice that the vacuum  is identified with
. The scalar product on  is identified with
the canonical scalar product on the space ,
which coincides with the expression of correlation functions as
traces on : form 
    uv ( U^V) (e^-2H_A ) 
     if   u U, v V.
The representation of a field on  is identified with
its representation on :



where  is the representation map on the space .

The operators  can be fixed by imposing two
conditions. First, the operators on  representing
fields at the center of the disk that are mutually local with the
fermion field must commute (if they are bosonic) or anti-commute
(if they are fermionic) with the operators . It is
sufficient to impose this condition with the fermion operators
themselves: loc 
    a_(), (= a_(), ^(= 0.
Second, the embedding embed  must reproduce the form
factors of fermion fields

 and 
 obtained from the partial
wave decomposition pwave . As shown in Appendix A, these two
conditions are satisfied by the operators Acv 
    a_+() = _- ^  d g(;)  c_^    ,  
    a_-() = _- ^  d g(;)  c_- ,






Here and below we use the notation



where on the right hand side  is Gauss's
hypergeometric function on its principal branch. We believe that
the solution Acv  to the two conditions above is unique. One
can verify for instance that




such expression can be calculated by using the cyclic properties
of the traces and the anti-commutation relations for the modes
. As is shown in Appendix B.1, the operators
 anti-commute among themselves: Aacomm 
    a__1 (_1), a__2 (_2) = 0.
Also, since they are linear combinations of free modes,
traces of products of such operators satisfy Wick's theorem. In
particular we have the following contractions: &&
( e^-2H_A  a_ ^()
a_( e^-2H_A ) 
    = 1()  (_,

&&  ( e^-2H_A  a_ ()
a_( e^-2H_A ) 
    = 0
Since these contractions are respectively 
 and  and
since any form factor of fermion fields in  can be
evaluated by Wick's theorem, the embedding embed  reproduces
all form factors of fermion fields.

From the expression Acv  one can verify the following
identity:



This is the analogue of crossing symmetry present in theories on
flat space. For the scaling fields , which are scalar and
have the property , this leads for
instance to cs 
    (F_(_1,,_n)__1,,_n )^* = F_- (_n,,_1)_-_n,,-_1 
using the notation Fff .

From the representation scalingfieldPsi  of the scaling fields
on , we have the following embedding:



where  is the  charge in angular quantization:
Q 
    Q = _0 ^  d(c_^c_- c_-  c^_- ).
Using this embedding, form factors of the scaling fields
 are given heuristically by the following traces:





Both traces in the ratio above are ill-defined and need some
regularization . In the next section we
will regularize such traces by doing the angular quantization on a
Poincare disk from which a small disk of radius 
around the origin has been removed. As the regularization
parameter disappears , the resulting ratio of
traces above is then singular and goes as . We
can cancel out this singularity by considering normalized form
factors: ffdef 
    vac_(0) _1,,_n__1,,_n  vac_vac  
        = (e^-2H_A +2i Q  a__1 (_1) a__n (_n) ) 
        (e^-2H_A +2i Q ) .
These can be calculated without explicit reference to a
regularization procedure, simply by using, as above, the cyclic
properties of the trace and the anti-commutation relations for the
modes , . The calculation of the one-point
function requires the use of an explicit regularization procedure:
trace 
    _ = vac_vac = _0  ^-^2  _(e^-2H_A +2i Q  ) _(e^-2H_A ) ,
and will be done in the next section.

The traces ffdef  are calculated in Appendix B. In particular,
the "two-particle" form factors are given in ffapp . Other
"multi-particle" form factors of scaling fields  can
be constructed from these "two-particle" form factors by Wick's
theorem, as in mpff . In Appendix C, we verify that the
expression ffapp  for the "two-particle" form factors
specializes to the known expression for form factors in the
flat-space limit.

One-point function 

We now calculate the one-point function . This is a
simple generalization of the calculation done in for
similar vacuum expectation values in flat space.

We regularize the traces  by cutting a
small disk of radius  around the origin and
considering the angular quantization of the theory theory  on
the resulting annulus with the boundary conditions
boundcond 
    [() - ()]_ 2R )  =
    [() - ()]_ 2R )  = 0.
Then the one-point function  can be expressed as
trace , where the  charge  in the regularized theory
is



which specializes to Q  in the limit . It was
shown in that for the theory on flat space, the
definition trace  with the boundary conditions boundcond 
are in accordance with the conformal normalization norm .
Since the leading behavior at short distances of the two-point
function is not affected by the curvature, the expression
trace  with the boundary conditions boundcond  lead to the
same conformal normalization norm  for the theory on the
Poincare disk.

In order to evaluate the limit  in the expression
trace , we need the density of angular quantization states
, where the S-matrix  is associated
with the scattering off the "mass barrier" described in the
previous section:



Here  and  are the partial waves unu  and
vnu . The S-matrix is given by: Smatrix 
    S() = (2R)^2i  (1/2+i)(1/2-i+) (1/2-i)(1/2+i+)  .
Then one finds 1ptfct 
    _ = [_0^d 2i 
        ( (1+e^-2+ 22i a ) (1+e^-2- 22i a )  (1+e^-2 )^2   )
        _S() ].
The result of the integration using Smatrix  can be
expressed in various ways:     _ &=& (2R)^-^2  [ _0^dt t  (1-e^-2t ) ^2(t) ^2(t) ] 

VEV    &=& (2R)^-^2  _n=1 ^  ( 1-^2 (+n)^2  1-^2 n^2  )^n 

        &=& (2R)^-^2  G(1+G(1++) G(1+)^2 G(1-) G(1+)  ,
where  is Barnes' -function, characterized mainly
by the properties  and  (cf.
).

Long distance expansion of the two-point function 

As argued in Appendix B.1, the "two-particle" form factors
ffapp , like the partial waves pwaveexpr , are entire
functions of the spectral parameters  and  (hence
all form factors of scaling fields  are entire functions
of their spectral parameters). Moreover, they have the following
behavior as the real part of  or  goes to positive
or negative infinity: &&  (_1)  F_(_1,_2)_+,-  _1^-1    as   e(_1)

&&  (_2)  F_(_1,_2)_+,-  _2^-1    as   e(_2)up to proportionality factors, and other "multi-particle"
form factors have similar behaviors. Hence for , the
integrals over 's in genexp  are absolutely convergent.
They can be evaluated by deforming the contours in their lower
half planes and summing over the residues at the poles of the
measure . The measure  has poles on the
imaginary axis; in the lower half plane, they are at positions
 for .

It is instructive to interpret the poles in the measure
, and the evaluation of the integrals in genexp  by
contour deformation as described above, in terms of a different
quantization scheme. Let us summarize our construction. We choose
an isometry  isoK , subgroup of the full isometry group
, and we quantize the theory theory  on orbits of
this isometry. That is, the generator  of the subgroup
 generates "space" translations. A basis for the
corresponding Hilbert space  is taken as a set of states
diagonalizing . They are normalized so that all form
factors of local fields are entire functions of its eigenvalues
. With this normalization, the resolution of the identity on
 in terms of this basis involves a measure 
meas  with a specific analytical structure, in particular with
singularities on the imaginary axis. Now, these singularities
should give information about the spectrum in a quantization
scheme where  is taken as the Hamiltonian, that is, as the
generator of "time" translations.

This last assertion is the analogue of what is well known to
happen for instance in a free massive theory on flat space: the
singularity structure of the invariant measure 
 as function of the momentum  gives the
energy spectrum. Momentum operator and energy operator (or
Hamiltonian) can be seen as representations of the same
translation generator in two different quantization scheme, one
where this translation is along the "space" direction, the other
where it is along the "time" direction.

In a free theory on flat space, the invariant measure exhibits in
particular a branch cut starting at  and going to
, corresponding to the continuous spectrum (from 
to infinity) of the energy operator. In our free theory on the
Poincare disk, the position of the poles of the measure
meas  on the imaginary axis are interpreted as the discreet
eigenvalues of the generator  in the scheme where it is
taken as the Hamiltonian. It is a simple matter to repeat the
canonical quantization procedure of section 3 for this
quantization scheme. One indeed finds a discreet set of
eigenstates

with eigenvalues , where



Since these states diagonalize a generator of time translation,
they can be more naturally interpreted as multi-particle states.
Matrix elements of the operator  between the vacuum 
and multi-particle states in this scheme can be found from similar
matrix elements in the Hilbert space  by the following
identification:






and 
. The
resolution of the identity is given by the sum






which provides a long distance expansion for the two-point
function:     _(x)_&=& _n=0 ^  1n!  __1,,_n 
    _k_1,,k_n=0 ^  

&&  0_(0)k_1,,k_n__1,,_n 
      __n,,_1 k_n,,k_1_    e^-(_1++_n) (x,y) 2R   .
This expansion coincides with the sum of residues coming
from the evaluation of the integrals in genexp  by contour
deformation. Using crossing symmetry cs  and summing over the
 charges, this can be written genexpHp 
    _(x)_= _N=0 ^  1(N!)^2 
    _k_1,,k_2N =0 ^ 
    f_(k_1,,k_2N ) f_2N ,,k_1)
    e^-(_1++_2N ) (x,y) 2R  ,
where f 
    f_(k_1,,k_2N ) = 0_(0)k_1,,k_2N _+,+, _N ,-,-, _N  .
The normalized functions 
are evaluated in closed form in Appendices B.2, B.3. The first few
terms of genexpHp  give the following expansion for the
two-point function: ffexp  &&  F(t) = 1 - 4^2+1 
() ((1++) (1+    (1++(1+ 
    ^2 (2+2)^2  e^-(4+2) t  

&&       ( 1 - 22+1 (+1)^2  e^-2t  +
O(e^-4t ) ) 
    +  O(e^-(8+4)t ),
where the function  was defined in
leadinglongdist .

It is interesting to notice that in the massless limit ,
the two-point function still decreases exponentially at long
distance. This is a signal of the infrared regulator properties of
the negative curvature of the Poincare disk.

Two-point function from Painleve VI transcendents 

From, the two-point function can be described in terms
of a Painleve VI transcendent: diffeq 
    F(t) = [ -_^2t ^1 ds d ds  (s) ],
where  is given in tau  and the
Painleve transcendent  satisfies painleveintro  with
.

As said in the introduction, the integration constants specifying
the Painleve transcendent can be taken to be the exponents in
the behaviors of  at  (short distance) and at 
 (long distance), given, respectively, in ws0  and ws1 
(such a solution exists). The proportionality constants  and
 are then unambiguous. In particular, using results of Jimbo
 there is an explicit expression for the constant 
involved in the short distance behavior of : B 
    B =  ()((1-(+
        (1-)(1-(+(1-From this, one can obtain the full short distance expansion
of , valid for :



where . Once  is fixed, the other coefficients
 are uniquely determined by the differential equation
painleveintro .

The leading long distance asymptotics ws1  of this Painleve
transcendent is fixed by specifying the proportionality constant
. This constant can be obtained by comparing our form factor
result ffexp  with the expansion Flarged ; this leads to
the value A . Since we must have  for all , the
asymptotics ws1  is valid only for , and the asymptotics
ws0  only for . This imposes . From the behavior
ws1  and using the differential equation, one can obtain the
full long distance expansion of : wlarged 
    1-w = A(1-s)^1+2 _p,q=0 ^  D_p,q   (1-s)^p(1+2) + q 
with . For instance, the coefficients 
are given by D0q 
    _q=0 ^  D_0,q  (1-s)^q = s^The long distance expansion wlarged  can also be obtained
from the full form factors expansion genexpHp . For instance,
one can verify that the coefficient  in D0q  is
consistent with the coefficient of  in the parenthesis in
the form factor expansion ffexp .

Solving numerically the differential equation by using the
appropriate initial conditions, it is possible to verify the
consistency of our result A  for the constant involved in the
long distance asymptotics of , our result VEV  for the
one-point function, and the value B  for the constant involved
in the short distance asymptotics of . We used as initial
condition the long distance asymptotics wlarged  with non-zero
coefficients  given in D0q  and with the value A 
for the normalization constant. We numerically verified that the
behavior ws0  with the constant B  is recovered, and that
the equation norm  is satisfied to a high accuracy.

Conclusion 

We have fully characterized the two-point function
 in the Dirac theory on the Poincare
disk, with fermion mass  and Gaussian curvature ,
in the region  and . A
comparison of our long distance expansion with the expansion
obtained from the Painleve VI differential equation strongly
suggests both that our "form factor" expansion is correct and
that the Painleve VI differential equation indeed describes the
two-point function of the scaling fields  in the region of
parameters above. Notice that our results and the description
above in terms of the differential equation are valid in the
region  as well; however, they do not describe all
the possible behaviors in this region.

It would be very interesting to extend this description to a
larger region of , and to fully analyze the region
 and the analytical continuation to negative values
of . Probably one of the most interesting eventual application
of this description is to the analysis of an appropriate scaling
limit of a "near-critical" Ising model on the Poincare disk.
Two-point functions of flat-space Ising spin fields in the scaling
limit are simply related to two-point functions of the scaling
fields  in the free Dirac theory on flat space
. If similar relations exist between the Ising
spin fields on the Poincare disk and the fields
 in the free Dirac theory on the Poincare disk,
the study of the latter can give information about the effect of
the Poincare geometry on the statistical properties of the Ising
model. For instance, the one-point function VEV  for
 should be proportional to the square of the Ising
magnetization near "criticality". In the same spirit, from the
point of view of the Ising model on the Poincare disk, the
region , and in particular the analytical continuation
to negative values of , should show the most interesting
features, especially in view of the arguments of. We
hope to present results of such investigations in a future
publication.

Construction of the embedding 

Here we describe a method for obtaining the expression Acv 
for the operators . We first solve the locality
condition loc  for a set of operators  depending on
a complex parameter :



with the following ansatz:




This leads to the equations:




where  is given in Smatrix . The first equation is
satisfied if  is analytical in the lower half -plane
and increases at most exponentially as , and
the second equation is satisfied if  is analytical
in the upper-half -plane and increases at most exponentially
as . Indeed, under such conditions it is
possible, for  negative and large enough, to send the
contour of integration to  in the integral
,
giving zero contribution, and similarly for the integral

 by sending the contour of integration to 
. This set of conditions on  forms a
simple Riemann-Hilbert problem, a solution of which is:     f() = 2  (12++i) (12 + ) (12+i) .
fnu  The operators  can then be formed by taking
appropriate linear combinations of . These linear
combinations can be obtained by requiring that the states
 diagonalize the
subgroup  and that they be correctly normalized. First
consider states  embedded in 
 by the identification 
. Using this embedding we can calculate the
following matrix elements:     vac (_R(z,z )) r_+ &=& -i (1+) (12+) 
        (1-zz )^r^-12  (1-z  r)^-  (1-zr^-1 )^-

    vac (_L(z,z )) r_+ &=& (1+) (12+) 
        (1-zz )^r^12  (1-z r^-1 )^-  (1-z r)^-PsiZ From this and from the transformation properties
of the fermion fields one can infer the transformation properties
of the states  under the isometry group :



where the functions  and  are automorphic
factors:



Diagonalizing this action for the subgroup , we obtain the
operators : aint 
    a_() = 2^-e^-i 2 (+12 + i 2)   (12+)^2 
     (12 + + i 2) (12 + - i 2) 
    _-1 ^1 dr(1-r)^ 2  (1+r)^ 2 r^-Z_(r),
where the integral is performed in the region
 (other integration contours are possible but
equivalent). The normalization was fixed by comparing with the
partial wave pwaveexpr . The expression aint  for
 is equivalent to Acv .


Construction of form factors  We study the normalized form
factors of scaling fields ffdef :




where we use the notation normcorr 
     _=
        (e^-2K + 2iQ  ) ( e^-2K + 2iQ ) .
We will assume that the spectral parameters  are real,
except when explicitly stated.


Construction of "two-particle" form factors 

From the cyclic properties of the trace and the anti-commutation
relations for the angular quantization modes, we have



From the definition Acv , the trace ffdef  is then
expressed as an integral: &&  a_+(_1)a_-(_2)
_=
    4^-  e^(_2-_1)4  (1+)^2  _- ^d
    (+12+i) (+() 1+e^2i   
    

&&  F( + 12 -
i,+_1 2;1+2;2+i0)
    F( + 12 - i,+_2 2;1+2;2-i0). The contour of integration goes between the poles at
 and .

The integrand is proportional to
 when ,
and to  when
. This can be obtained from the asymptotics






valid for . The integral can be
regularized by multiplying the integrand by a factor 
with some complex parameter ; the integral is then convergent
for . It can be evaluated by the
method of residues, closing the contour for instance in the upper
half plane if . The "two-particle" form factor is
the analytical continuation to  of the resulting expression.
Contributions of poles in the upper half plane give
ffapp0 
    a_+(_1)a_-(_2) _=
    4^-  ie^(_2-_1)4  
        (((1+)^2 
    [ G_ (_1,_2) - e^-i(G_ (_1,_2) ],
where  is the analytical continuation to
 of the following series: G  &&
G_^(p) (_1,_2) = _n=0 ^[ ()
        (1+++n) (1-++n)  e^ip(12++n)  . 

&&  .
F(+1++n,+_1 2;2+1;2+i0)
        F(+1++n,+_2 2;2+1;2-i0) ]
        and  is the analytical continuation to
 of the series above with  replaced by . Note that
the function  is shown below to be identically
zero.

The series  is convergent in the upper
half -plane  as well as on 
. The analytical continuation to  can
be done via a "zeta-regularization". More precisely, we
subtract, inside the summation symbol in G , the leading large
 asymptotics of the summand: &&  (2+1)^2 () 4^-  (2n)^-1  e^ e^ip(12++n)  

&&  [ (2n)^-i  (+_1 2)
(+12 - i_2 2) 
         + .
    (2n)^i  (+12+i_1 2) (+12 + i_2 2) 
         + 

&&
e^i(-i  (+_1 2)
(+12 + i_2 2) 
          +
    . e^-i(i  (+12+i_1 2) (+12 - i_2 2) 
          ] ,
where  and 
. The resulting series is convergent at . We
then add to this series at  the following quantity: &&  (2+1)^2 () 4^-  e^  

&&  [ 1 (+_1 2)
(+12 - i_2 2) 
        (1+i) 2^1+i   + .
    1 (+12+i_1 2) (+12 + i_2 2) 
        (1-i) 2^1-i   +  

&&  e^i(-i -1)
 (+_1 2) (+12 +
i_2 2) 
        (1+i) 2^1+i   +
    . e^-i(i -1)  (+12+i_1 2) (+12 - i_2 2) 
        (1-i) 2^1-i   ]  ,
where  is Riemann's zeta function. The result is
. Notice that the function 
is real for real .

The resulting expression for  defines a
function of  and  analytical in the region 
, . By repeating the
procedure above for the full large  asymptotics of the summand
of , one can see that the function
 thus defined has no singularity in the finite
complex - and -planes: the function
 is an entire function of  and .

The function  can now be evaluated in the
following way. From ffapp0 , we have






By covariance under the subgroup  we find



Since the function  is entire, this implies
that it must be identically zero. Notice that a similar
calculation leads to . Since the
commutator  is a -number, an
immediate consequence is the anti-commutation property
Aacomm .

Hence we finally have     F_(_1,_2)_+,-  _  =
    4^-  ie^(_2-_1)4  
        (((1+)^2  G_ (_1,_2).
ffapp  
Two-particle form factors in the discreet basis 

It is possible to evaluate the function  for
some purely imaginary values of  and . We will
evaluate it for the values  and 
 for integers  and . This can
be done by using the analytical continuation described above.
Equivalently, it can be done by simply replacing these values of
 and  in the expression G , evaluating the
resulting series at  in a region of  where it is
convergent and analytically continuing the result in . With



this gives     G_;k_1,k_2   =
    () _m_1=0 ^k_1  _m_2=0 ^k_2 
    (-k_1)_m_1  (-k_2)_m_2  2^m_1+m_2  
    (2+1)_m_1  (2+1)_m_2  m_1! m_2!  H_m_1,m_2 
where




The  hypergeometric function above can be evaluated in
closed form, for any given integer  and , in terms of
Gamma functions and rational functions of  and . The
two-particle form factors  in the discreet basis are
expressed in terms of :     f_(k_1,k_2) _  =
    2^2+1 i(-1)^k_1  (1+2+k_1)(1+2+k_2) k_1!k_2!  
    G_;k_1,k_2  (1+2)^2 ((  .

"Multi-particle" form factors 

The "multi-particle" form factors of scaling fields can be
evaluated by Wick's theorem in terms of the two-particle form
factors. We have     F_(_1,,_n )__1,,_n 
    = _j=2 ^n (-1)^j F_(_1,_j)__1,_j 
    F_(_2,,_j ,,_n)__2,,_j ,,_n 
where the hat over an argument means omission of this
argument. Of course this will be non-zero only for 
. Forming the  matrix 
 with matrix
elements 

, the "multi-particle" form
factors can be written as Pfaffians( Using this, one can
immediately write the form factor expansion genexp  as a
Fredholm determinant in the case . ) :     F_(_1,,_n )__1,,_n  =
    Pf  (F _(_1,,_n)__1,,_n ).
Using Aacomm , it is always possible to choose the order
such that  operators with positive  charge are followed
by  operators with negative  charge. Forming the 
 matrix 
 with matrix elements 

, we have mpff 
    F_(_1,,_N ,_1,,_N)_+,+, _N ,-,-, _N   =
    (G _(_1,,_N;_1,,_N)).
Similar expressions are valid for the form factors
 in the discreet
basis.


Flat space limit of form factors 

It is a simple matter to verify that the "two-particle" form
factors ffapp  specialize to the known expression in the flat
space limit. Two-particle form factors of the scaling fields
 in the flat space limit, with particle at rapidities
 and  and states normalized by 

, are obtained by
&&  vac _ _1, _2_+- ^flat  = _  

&&  (2)^^2+1  2(2(_1))
(2(_2))
    (_1)(_2)  F_(2(_1), 2(_2))_+-  and the one-point function is obtained by




Using the expression ffapp , this gives the known normalized
flat space form factors, first obtained in:
