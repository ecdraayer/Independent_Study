Abstract 



The most general parallelizable pp-wave backgrounds which are non-dilatonic
solutions in the NS-NS sector of type IIA and IIB string theories are
considered.
We demonstrate that parallelizable pp-wave backgrounds are necessarily
homogeneous plane-waves, and that a large class of homogeneous plane-waves
are parallelizable, stating the necessary conditions.
Such plane-waves can be classified according to the number
of preserved supersymmetries. In type IIA, these include 
backgrounds
preserving 16, 18, 20, 22 and 24 supercharges, while in the IIB case they 
preserve
16, 20, 24 or 28 supercharges. An intriguing property of parallelizable pp-wave
backgrounds is that the bosonic part of these solutions are invariant 
under T-duality, while the number of supercharges might change under 
T-duality. Due to their
 exactness, they provide interesting backgrounds for
studying string theory. Quantization of string modes, their 
compactification and behaviour under T-duality are studied.
In addition, we consider BPS -branes, and show that 
these -branes can be classified in terms of the locations
of their world volumes with respect to 
the background -field.
 






Introduction 

More than a decade ago it was argued that  s provide us with 
solutions of supergravity which are -exact.
It has also been shown that any solution of classical general relativity 
(GR) in a special limit known as the Penrose limit, generates a plane-wave 
geometry 
. Plane-waves are a sub-class of s with planar
symmetries. The process of taking the Penrose limit consists of finding a 
light-like geodesic, expanding the metric about that geodesic and scaling 
all the coordinates corresponding to the other directions properly
. The Penrose limit 
has also been extended to supergravity solutions.
However, not much attention was focused on these solutions
until very recently, when it was realized 
that the string theory sigma model on a large class of s is solvable 
.
The recent interest has been further boosted  by the work of 
Berenstein-Maldacena-Nastase, BMN,
, where they noted that a specific  solution in the type IIB 
supergravity appears as the Penrose limit of  geometry 
and hence is a maximally supersymmetric solution of type IIB theory. Based 
on this observation they proposed a correspondence between certain 
operators of   super Yang-Mills theory and string theory 
on s. The BMN proposal has by now passed many crucial tests
(see for e.g., and references therein),
and has been extended to many other cases with various numbers of
supercharges. 

It has also been argued that all ten dimensional  
solutions of type IIA, IIB or heterotic supergravities 
are also -exact. In the physics sense,  
manifolds are 
those for which  there exists a (parallelizing) torsion which makes the 
manifold flat.(More precise definition of  would be 
presented in section 2.)  Besides flat space which is 
trivially , generically,  spaces are endowed with torsion 
and hence are usually ignored in the context of classical GR. 
However, they arise naturally in most string theories (with the exception of type I)
where the field strength of the NS-NS two-form field 
 is interpreted as torsion in the target space.

Generally, in these  supergravity solutions only the metric and 
 fields are turned on, i.e., these are non-dilatonic solutions 
in the NS-NS sector of IIA or IIB supergravities.   
As we will prove in section 3, as a result of ,  the  
variation of the gravitinos vanishes for 32 independent solutions 
and hence all the restrictions on the number of supercharges
come from the dilatino variations.

In this work we will focus on s which are  and prove that in 
general the s are necessarily of the form of homogeneous  s and 
also show that a large class of homogeneous  geometries are , including  
the geometries coming as Penrose limits of  and 
. We also argue that  survives the Penrose 
limit, and hence the Penrose limits of  geometries(
Note that this geometry is not a solution of , this will 
be clarified more in section 3.2.)  are also 
s. We show that general s form a family of -exact 
supergravity solutions determined by four real parameters. Then we proceed 
with counting the number of supercharges for these s. We 
show that the maximum number of supersymmetries for a  is 28 which 
corresponds to a IIB  background with  rotational symmetry,
a solution which has appeared previously in reference. 

Performing a Michelson transformation, we study 
toroidal compactification of our solutions and their behaviour under 
T-duality. A remarkable property of s is that the bosonic part of such 
solutions are invariant under T-duality; however, due to the change in the 
boundary conditions, the number supersymmetries of such T-dual solutions 
might be different. We recall that this property is a generic feature of 
all 
homogeneous s, regardless of whether they are  or not. 
In general, we show that a  in type IIA with  
supercharges is T-dual to the same geometry in type IIB with 
 or  supersymmetries. In addition, there exist
 solutions for which . Therefore, for 
there is the possibility of finding self T-dual solutions.

In section 6, we formulate string theory on the most general  
background and show that in light-cone gauge it is solvable with a 
particularly simple spectrum. We also study T-duality at the level of 
string theory. In our case, as a result of the existence of a non-zero 
NS-NS H-field, the right and left-movers of closed string modes enter
differently. Specifically, only left (or right) movers appear in the zero-modes.
This in particular leads to the peculiar property that the 
zero-mode in one direction behaves as the momentum mode of another 
direction. Hence, the
string is probing a non-commutative cylinder where its fuzziness is 
inversely proportional 
to the -field strength, as well as the light-cone momentum. 
We then turn to the question of -branes in the  backgrounds 
and briefly discuss which classes of BPS -branes can exist in these backgrounds.
A full analysis of these -branes is postponed to future works.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 contains a review of
needed material. We first review the definition of s, s and 
homogeneous s and fix our conventions and notations. We then state 
the definition of  and some facts about  manifolds. In 
section 3, we present implications of  for supergravity and its 
solutions. In section 4, we prove that all  s are
homogeneous s and classify the s by the amount of supersymmetry 
they preserve. In section 5, we discuss toroidal compactification of 
s as well as their invariance  under a large class of T-dualities.
In section 6, we study superstring theory on s and work out the 
bosonic and fermionic  string spectrum (in the light-cone gauge). In 
section 7, we study T-duality on the string spectrum. In section 8,
we briefly discuss -branes on s. The last section is devoted 
to concluding remarks and open questions.



 

 



Reviews 


In this section we review, very briefly, some of the necessary facts about 
the two basic ingredients of this paper, 
s and . For more detailed discussions of these topics the reader is 
referred to the literature.



Review of pp-waves 


A general class of space-times with interesting properties are given by
pp-waves . They are defined as space-times which support a 
covariantly constant null Killing
vector field ,
 





In the most general form, they have metrics which can be written as 
 
where  is the metric on the space transverse to a pair of 
light-cone directions given by  and the coefficients
,  and  are constrained by 
(super-)gravity equations of motion.
The pp-wave metric () has a null Killing vector
given by  which is in fact 
covariantly constant by virtue of the vanishing of .
The most useful pp-waves, and the ones generally considered in the 
literature, have  and are flat in the transverse directions, i.e.
, for which the metric becomes
pp'metric 
ds^2  = 
-2 du dv -F(u,x^i) du^2 + _ij  dx^i dx^j . 
Existence of a covariantly null Killing vector field of the space-time 
implies that all the higher dimensional operators built from curvature 
invariants vanish and hence there are no -corrections to 
s of the form () which are solutions of classical 
supergravity.(
In general, if  the statement
about -exactness is not true and the transverse metric, , 
itself may receive -corrections, however, there are no extra 
corrections due to the wave part of the metric.)  
For string theory, however, the existence of this null Killing vector
leads to a definition of frequency (in light-cone gauge) which is 
conserved and as a result, the usual problem of non-flat space-times, 
namely the particle (string) creation, is not present.

A more restricted class of pp-waves, the plane-waves , are those 
admitting a globally defined  covariantly constant null Killing 
vector field. One can show that for s
 is quadratic in the  coordinates of the transverse space,
but still can depend on the coordinate ,
, so that the metric takes the form
 
Here  is symmetric and by virtue of the only non-trivial
condition coming form the equations of motion, its trace is related to
the other field strengths present.
For the case of vacuum Einstein equations, it is traceless.

There is yet a more restricted class of plane-waves, homogeneous plane 
waves, for which  is a constant, hence their metric is of the 
form
homometric 
ds^2  = 
-2 du dv -_ij  x^i x^j du^2 + dx^i dx^i  ,
with  being a constant.(
This usage of the term homogeneous is not universal. For example,
the term symmetric plane-wave has been used infor this form of the metric, reserving homogeneous for a wider subclass of plane-waves.
) 


Parallelizability 


An  dimensional manifold M is said to be parallelizable if there exists
a smooth section of the frame bundle, or equivalently, if there exist 
smooth sections of the tangent bundle T(M), such that they are linearly
independent at each point of M.  More intuitively, 
a manifold is 
parallelizable if one can cover the whole manifold with a single non-degenerate
coordinate system. 
In general, most manifolds are not
parallelizable.  However, group manifolds are always parallelizable. A
well known result of K-theory due to Adams is the
classification of all parallelizable spheres. These consist only of ,
 and . One can demonstrate the parallelizability of  and
 by noting that they are group manifolds:  is the group manifold
of , while  is the group manifold of .
However,  which can be thought of as the octonions of unit norm,  
is not a group manifold
because the octonionic algebra is non-associative and so the associativity 
property of groups is not satisfied.
This result on parallelizable 
spheres is
closely linked to the Hurwitz theorem, which gives a complete
classification of the unital composition algebras (i.e. Hurwitz algebras),
as the reals, the complex numbers, the quaternions and the octonions (or 
Cayley numbers),


and the fact that ,  and  are topologically equivalent to 
the complex numbers, 
quaternions and octonions of unit norm, respectively. The 
non-parallelizability of  is
enshrined in the famous no hair theorem.
We should also note that, for the reason stated above,  the 
Lorentzian version of , i.e.,  
is also .  

There is another definition of parallelizable manifolds due to 
Cartan-Schouten:
A manifold is called parallelizable if there exists a torsion which 
"flattens" the manifold, i.e. makes the Riemann curvature tensor vanish.
We caution the reader that the definitions of  we have given 
here, which is the one assumed in the physics literature, is known in the 
mathematics literature as absolute parallelism, and is a stronger condition than 
the mathematical definition.
In general, absolute parallelism implies parallelism, but not vice-versa.

Let us make explicit the decomposition of the 
connection into a  piece and a torsion contribution:
 ^ _ =  ^ _ + 
T^ _   ,
where  is symmetric in  indices and  
 (torsion) is anti-symmetric. The curvature 
 may be decomposed in a similar way, into a piece
which comes only from the  connection and the torsional 
contributions:
curvature 
R _  R _ +
_ T_ -_ T_ 
+T_ T^ _ -T_ T^ _  .
The  condition then simply becomes 
.  
If
the modified Ricci tensor
Riccipara 
R _  R _ +_ T^ _ 
-T_ T^ _ 
is zero, the manifold is said to be Ricci-. Note that the generalized Ricci 
tensor  is not symmetric in its  indices.
For a manifold to be Ricci-, the symmetric and anti-symmetric parts 
of 
 should both vanish, namely 
 and 
.  

With the above definitions, the parallelizing torsion (in an orthonormal frame)
for a group manifold is given by the structure constants of the group 
algebra. 


Parallelizability and supergravity 


Since in most string theories, a torsion field naturally arises,
one may look for implications of  for supergravities and 
their solutions. Here we mainly focus on type II theories, however, most 
of our arguments can be used for heterotic theories as well.

First we recall that the NS-NS part of the  action is of the form
sugraaction 
S=1 l_p^8  d^10 x -g  e^-2 ( R+4
(_)^2 -1 12  H^2) .
Since we are interested in solutions involving only the metric and 
torsion, we set the dilaton field  to a constant. Then the  
equations of motion for the metric and  field are
 
 
If we define  as torsion ,
as we discussed in previous section, the  equations for the metric 
and  fields are nothing but the Ricci- condition. 
Hence all  manifolds (which are obviously also Ricci-) 
satisfying the constant dilaton constraint
Dilaton 
R=1 12  H^2
are solutions of .

For any  solution one may wonder about   and  
exactness as well as (classical) stability. The  solutions which we 
are interested in are non-dilatonic and hence they are  independent. 
The -exacctness of these  solutions were studied long 
ago in reference. Computing the second  contributions 
to the string theory -functions, it was shown that such 
contributions are zero for  manifolds.(Of course, as 
in any field theory with more than one coupling, the two loop 
renormalizations are scheme dependent, and according to reference 
 in a specific scheme such contributions are zero for 
 manifolds. For further details the reader is referred to that 
reference.)  Therefore the  solutions of  are exact up to 
order . It has been argued that this property is expected to 
remain to all orders in .
    
 




Parallelizability and supersymmetry 


In this section we will demonstrate one of the interesting implications of 
 for supergravity solutions. Here we restrict 
ourselves to type II theories. Our conventions can be found in the appendix.

Theorem: 

If we denote the  variations of the gravitinos by 
, 
 implies that  has the maximal number 
of solutions (32) and thus does not lead to any restrictions on the number of 
supercharges. Therefore all the   restricting conditions come from 
the dilatino variations.

To prove the above theorem, we make use of the  variations for type
IIA and IIB string theories, whose complete expression is presented in the 
appendix.
For our  backgrounds, which do not depend on RR fields,
the IIA and IIB expressions both reduce to
Dhat 
D  _   =  _ 
+1 4   _ ,
where  is the torsional spin connection(
In string theory terminology  only captures 
the torsion independent part of the connection and is completely
determined by the  connection.
) 
and is given by
connection 
 _ = 
_^ab  _ab +1 2  
_3 ^ab  H_ab   .


















The Killing spinor equation reads
 
The commutator of two covariant derivatives acting on a spinor 
contains a contribution from the curvature and also a torsion piece
multiplying a covariant derivative
 
Now we note that for  manifolds, by virtue of the vanishing 
of the
curvature computed from the connection with parallelizing torsion, 
the Killing spinor equation implies
 
The left-hand side is zero for solutions of 
(). That is, () is an 
integrability 
condition on the differential equation ().
We find that the integrability condition imposes no extra constraints on the solution
(this is special to parallelizable manifolds). Note that the vanishing 
of the Riemann curvature tensor is central to this argument; Ricci parallelizability, i.e.,
the vanishing of the
Ricci tensor computed with parallelizing torsion, does not suffice.
Since the Killing spinor equation is a first order differential equation,
it can be solved by introducing the ansatz,
 
where
 
and  is a 32 component spinor(
This has an interpretation as a gauge transformation, where the Killing spinors are pure gauge
when the connection is taken to be that with parallelizing torsion.) 
and  denotes the path ordering symbol.
Plugging the ansatz ansatz  into (), the 
gravitino Killing equation reduces to 
chi 
_  =0 .
That is, equation () is solved for any constant .
This provides  independent solutions for both types IIA and IIB.

So far we have shown that for any parallelizable manifold, the Killing spinor equation 
arising from vanishing of the gravitino variation is satisfied for any spinor of the form 
(,) and the correct number of unbroken 
supersymmetries is only determined with the zero
dilatino  variation condition.(
This is in contrast to the usual situation with plane-waves, where the 
dilatino equation is redundant and the supersymmetries are determined 
only by the gravitino equation.) 
For a constant dilation background with the only non-vanishing flux 
the NS-NS field strength, in string frame, this condition is
 
Therefore, the associated condition for the existence of Killing spinors is
, for .



Some examples of ten dimensional  geometries 


Direct products of  manifolds are also .
As a 
famous example we mention  
. The  is  
by virtue of being a group manifold. However,    
for the dilaton, namely equation (), forces the  and sphere to have 
the same radii. 
Therefore,
this non-dilatonic solution is  if  
is , and since the only  four dimensional manifold
which is compatible with Dilaton ,
is flat 
space, it is  if  is  or . However, if  is Ricci 
flat,
e.g. , this solution is only Ricci-.



























Another explicit example of a parallelizable ten dimensional 
geometry (which is not, however, a  solution) background 
can be built out of  and  with the
following background field configuration
   
for the  part, and
  ds^2  = 
    R_2^2 4  (
    d ^2 + 1 4  sin^2 (_i - _i)^2  + 
    ^2 ( ^2  2  _i + ^2  2  
_i )^2
    )  ,

relations as , but with

its  isometry.




One may analogously define the squashed seven-sphere, topologically equivalent to
, as the distance sphere in the
projective quaternionic plane,
with metric derived from an isometric embedding.
A derivation of this metric is presented in
.
To yield an Einstein space,  can only take on two discrete
values, with  corresponding to  and  giving
the metric on the squashed .
An equivalent description of the squashed seven-sphere can be constructed by noting that
the round seven-sphere can be described as a fiber-bundle, with base  and fiber .
The squashing arises from a change of the  radius over the base.

The components of the torsion three form field  for this manifold, 
in an orthonormal frame, are given by the octonionic structure constants as
T_a b c   =  2 R_2   f_abc   ,
and the Ricci tensor and square of the three-form are
R_ab   =  

T_ab ^2  =  6 R_2^2   _ab   .
Note that the torsion field is not  a closed form(
We would like to thank Jose Figueroa-O'Farrill for pointing 
this out to us.) , in fact 

. 
Hence this parallelizing torsion is not  
the field strength of any (NS-NS) two form field and consequently 
 geometry discussed here, although being , is not a 
 solution. We would like to point out that
this non-closedness of torsion is related to the non-associativity of the 
octonion algebra, and for all group manifolds
the parallelizing torsion is a closed form.



















The round  provides an example of a parallelizable geometry, i.e.,
its modified Riemann tensor vanishes. However, a specific deformation of
the round , the squashed  () with the metric given in
() for , leads to a manifold which is only
Ricci-. The torsion still has the form of 
S7:structure ,
however, now the Ricci tensor and  are related via
.(Note that the Ricci
tensor in Ricci:S7  is derived from the connection without
torsion.)  Then  is a ten dimensional Ricci- 
manifold.



Parallelizable pp-waves 


In this section we construct the most general  which is also . 
Such solutions are "doubly -exact" backgrounds of string theory 
in the sense that they are both  and have a covariantly constant null 
Killing vector field. Here we first prove a theorem showing that all 
 pp-waves are homogeneous s. Then in the second part of this section 
we will classify all the  s by the number of their . In 
the last part of this section, as an example, we work out the Penrose limit 
of , and show that these solutions only preserve 
16 (kinematical) .



Parallelizable pp-waves as homogeneous plane-waves 


Theorem: 

All parallelizable pp-waves are homogeneous plane-waves.

To prove this assertion, we begin 
with the most general ten dimensional  geometry whose metric is given 
in equation () where now . Of course, the 
functions  are chosen to satisfy  equations of motion. 
The next step is to write the most general NS-NS  field compatible with 
the covariantly constant Killing vector . This nails down the 
choices for the -field to
Hfield 
H_uij = h_ij (u,x^i) ,
and all the other components zero.
Now, we are ready to impose the  conditions. We may start by
imposing  equations of motion. The Ricci curvature for the 
metric () may be found in.
Then we note that the only non-zero  components of the inverse 
metric is , therefore
H^2 
H_  H_ ^  =_u _u 
h_ij h_kl g^ik g^jl  ,
and hence all the components of the Ricci curvature except  should be 
zero by virtue of the  equations of motion or equivalently the 
Ricci- conditions. However, first we note that 
implies that
Rij 
R_ijkl =0  g_ij (u,x^i)=g_ij (u)  .
Before imposing other   we note that using (), after 
a coordinate transformation, the metric can always be brought to the form




Then  leads to
_i F_ij =0,     F_ij =_[i  A _j]  ,
and  results in
Ruu 
1 2 ^2F =1 4  (F_ij F^ij + h_ij  
h^ij ) .
Note that the freedom in defining  coordinate leads to a  gauge 
symmetry in the definition of  and equation () is written 
in the Lorentz gauge, . Finally the equation of motion
for the  field implies that
_i h_ij =0 .
 
Next we impose the  condition. It is easy to see that the only remaining 
non-trivial equations come from  and 
. In order to avoid lengthy calculations we only 
summarize the results:
solution 
h_ij (u,x^i)&=&h_ij =constant  ,   F &=&_ij  x^i x^j ,   _ij =constant  ,A _i&=&1 2 F_ij  x^j ,   F_ij =-F_ji =
constant  
,
and
_ij =1 4 (h_ik h_jk  +F_ik F_jk ) .
In summary, the most general   is of the form
pppwave1 
 ds^2  &=& -2 du dv -_ij  x^i x^j du^2 + F_ij  x^j du dx^j +
dx^i dx^i , 
H_uij  &=& h_ij =constant   .
It can be shown that we can still use rotations in the transverse space 
( directions) to remove the  terms in the metric. Note that 
such rotations will not change . We will further 
discuss this coordinate transformation in section 5. Therefore, 
the most general   can also be written as(
It may seem that geometries of the form 
, where  is a non-flat, parallelizable manifold and 
 is a   of the kind we have discussed, should be 
included in our  list. In fact 
since  can only be even, , the only possibility 
for  is . Although such geometries are , 
they do not satisfy the constant dilaton constraint (), and hence 
are not non-dilatonic  solutions.) 
pppwave2 
 ds^2  &=& -2 du dv -_ij  x^i x^j du^2 +dx^i dx^i  , H_uij  &=& h_ij =constant  ,
with
muij 
_ij =1 4  h_ik h_jk  .
This is of the form of a homogeneous , completing the proof.

In general the converse may not hold, i.e., not all
homogeneous  geometries are . In order to see which homogeneous 
s are , we note that  being an anti-symmetric 
 matrix, can always be brought to a block diagonal 
form by O(8) rotations, so that the only non-zero components are
foura 
h_12 =-h_21 =2a_1 ,  
h_34 =-h_43 =2a_2 ,   
h_56 =-h_65 =2a_3 ,   
h_78 =-h_87 =2a_4   .
Then eq. () yields 
_ij =diag(a_1^2,a_1^2,a_2^2,a_2^2,a_3^2,a_3^2,a_4^2,a_4^2) .
Therefore, all homogeneous s given by the metric () are 
 if and only if  has doubly degenerate eigenvalues.

The above theorem can be understood more intuitively by noting that , 
by definition, forces the covariantly constant null Killing vector field
of the , in our case , to be globally defined. Furthermore, 
it forbids the torsion from having any non-trivial space-time dependence; 
leaving us with the homogeneous s as the only possibility.

We see from eq. (), that in the most general case, a 
is completely determined by four real numbers, . Depending on 
the values of 's, the O(8) rotational symmetry of the transverse
space is broken to sub-groups, however, for the generic case (all  
taking different values) there remains a U(1) symmetry. In the most 
symmetric case, where all 's are equal, we have a U(4) symmetry. 
The case with  and  arises from the Penrose 
limit of . The s similar to
those of eq. () have also been considered in
.




Supersymmetry counting and classification 







































In section  we showed that, for  backgrounds, the gravitino
variations impose no constraints on the number of supersymmetries; hence, the
number of unbroken supercharges is determined entirely by the variation of the
dilatino dilatino:variation .
We write the two Majorana-Weyl spinors as two Majorana spinors as in the
appendix, subject to the appropriate chirality conditions chirality .

For the backgrounds we are considering, the non-zero spin connection components are
.

This together with the relations properties  implies that ,
and hence the expansion of  is linear in .
We also have .
Therefore, the supersymmetry variation of the dilatino can be reduced to
   = 
  - 1 4  ^abc  H_abc    =  0
for ,
constant Majorana spinors ansatz .

For these backgrounds, the field strength
components with one leg along the light-cone direction 
are non-vanishing, and there are no purely transverse contributions. As a result, the
dilatino variation always contains a  acting on .
In the most general  background foura ,
nice:killing:spinor:eqn  imposes as a condition for the existence of Killing spinors the
requirement
^+  ^ =  0 , 
with the two spinors subject again to their chirality conditions(
See chirality .) ,
and we have defined
.(
See H:contraction  for an explicit realization of .) 

To analyze the dilatino variation, it is easiest to work in a specific basis adapted to the
problem, and we choose the basis basis . We can write a general spinor as
 = 
(
 






) 
with , all eight component column vectors.
The chirality conditions imply, in this basis,
^11   _R  = + _R  
_R  =

for right handed spinors, and

)      then

for left handed spinors.

To analyze the Killing spinor equation,
start with an arbitrary left-handed spinor , of the form left:chirality ,
then subtract off components along the subspace projected out by 
( above).

The remaining spinor is of the form









.
Since  commutes with , we may add to 
any arbitrary spinor components
on the subspace projected out by , and these do not contribute to the
Killing spinor equation.
These unconstrained components provides a minimal set of Killing spinors,
eight for each Majorana spinor above, for a total of 16. These are the
standard or kinematical Killing spinors which exist on any ,
so are always present after a Penrose-Gueven limit.
The kinematical supercharges are thus in the kernel of .
Their presence is a direct consequence of the existence of
a null Killing vector on the  space-time manifold.

Write  as diag(A,B,A,B),
with A and B themselves diagonal matrices with eigenvalues that are doubly degenerate
(up to a sign).
Now require . This amounts to the equation .
The entries of  are a set of four independent algebraic functions of
the  from which the field strength is constructed foura ,
given by , in equation constants .
Some of these  may vanish identically for a given background, and the components
of  acted on by these can be taken to be arbitrary. They provide additional
Killing spinors beyond the standard kinematical ones.
The components of  which are not projected out by the action of A in a given
background must then vanish if  is to provide a solution of the Killing
spinor equation, and so do not contribute any additional supercharges.(
Notice that it is not possible, if all  are non-zero,
to simultaneously have some  and
another . If we had not subtracted off

the kernel of  (the kinematical supercharges ),
then  alone would yield
two simultaneous equations,  and , but
since  was assumed arbitrary,  and so , which is
possible only for all , contradicting the earlier assumption.
This is another way to see that the presence
of  is central to the existence of any Killing spinors on non-trivial
s.) 
A similar argument carries through for the case of right handed spinors, where
the constraint becomes , and the four algebraic functions of interest
are now .













As an example, take the most symmetric non-trivial  background,
with , possessing
a U(4) symmetry (whose  center acts by interchanging the four planes).
Let us assume that we have subtracted off the kinematical supercharges.
For a left-handed spinor, the equations whose solutions gives rise to non-kinematical
supercharges, are ,
with the 's given in constants .
Of these, three are identically satisfied and one is not. As
a result,  of  are unconstrained.
For a right-handed spinor, the equations would be ,
and of these, none
are identically satisfied, so all of  must vanish for the dilatino variation to be
zero.
To each of these we may add 8 unconstrained supercharges which are projected out by the
action of .
This leads to the following counting of supercharges:
For type IIA, we have the standard 16, together with 6 from the left handed 
parameter and zero from the right handed one, for a total of 22 supercharges.
In type IIB, if both spinors are left handed, we have the maximal of 28 supercharges
for a non-trivial  background, while if
both are right handed, we only have 16, which is the minimum.
Clearly, for type IIA, the number of supercharges must be one of
,
while for type IIB the allowed number of supercharges is .
The sensitivity to chirality appears since the
non-zero components of right/left handed spinors appearing in
right:chirality  and left:chirality 
are required to satisfy different
sets of algebraic equations, whose form is evident in H:contraction:explicit .

Various configurations of the field strength, with their degrees of supersymmetry,
are presented in tables 1 and 2,
up to relabeling of the coordinates and parity.
In both tables,
unless otherwise stated, the  are assumed non-zero and not to be equal.
We also state the symmetry of the transverse part of the given background, up to translations
which do not depends on the form of the constant field strength, and parity.
Since  supercharges are possible in both IIA and IIB, there exists the
possibility of finding self T-dual backgrounds for these numbers of preserved supersymmetries.
This is discussed in section .
The Penrose-Gueven limit of the  geometry, presented in 
section 3.2,
has a background symmetry of
U(1)  U(3).

The maximal symmetry for a  is U(4) and the minimal is U(1).

Classification of various  backgrounds in chiral type IIB 














Flipping the sign of one of the  corresponds to a parity operation on
the two dimensional plane whose field strength components  determines,
since the field  is odd under parity. This parity acts by changing the sign
of one of the coordinates on the plane; changing both amounts to a rotation.
This parity operation also interchanges the chirality of the spinors,
and so the number of supercharges is insensitive to this sign in IIA.
In type IIB, this interchange corresponds to the exchange of two solutions in table
2, taking solutions with both left handed spinors to both right handed
and vice-versa. For a few exceptional cases with some  vanishing,(
See footnote 16.) 
the IIB theory of one chirality has the same amount of supersymmetry as the IIB
theory of opposite chirality,
and so the number of supercharges, even for type IIB, is not sensitive to parity.
An example is the background .





























































































































































































































































Penrose limit of  


Given any  solution one can take the Penrose limit and obtain a 
plane-wave geometry. We may start with a   solution. Then, it 
is easy to show that  survives the Penrose 
limiting procedure, and hence after the Penrose limit we find a  , 
which is necessarily of the form given in (, ). A 
well-known 
example is the Penrose limit of  
, which leads to a  with ,  in 
the notation of eq. (). 

As another example, we work out the Penrose limit of 
 manifold discussed earlier in section 3.2.
To begin with, for definiteness, let us consider the  
case. To take the Penrose limit, it is more convenient to write the metric 
in the  global coordinates:
 
 
where
R_2^2 R_1^2 r^2
and the other -field components along
 given in equation ().
Now we take the  limit together with
Penrose 
y R_1  &,&   x R_2  , u=+r &,&    
v=1 2R^2_1 (,
where , all the other coordinates and also  are kept fixed. 
Then the 
metric () becomes
 
 
This solution, in the notation of (), is
.


As discussed in section 3.2, , due to the 
fact that the parallelizing torsion on  is not a closed form, 
is not a  solution. However, one might still take its Penrose limit.
The novel point is that the non-closed parts of the 
torsion will drop out after the limit and hence the corresponding 
plane-wave is a  solution of .

Using our previous arguments, one can show that the  
() only preserves the 16 kinematical .
As shown in, for a background
to preserve more than half the maximal supersymmetry, it must 
have a trivial dilaton dependence. These are generic behaviours of  
solutions.
The Penrose-Gueven limit can never destroy any supersymmetry, but
might enhance it.
 





One might wonder whether Ricci- is enhanced 
to  under the Penrose limit. This is not true in 
general. As an example, if we start with  as a 
Ricci- geometry, it remains only Ricci- 
after the Penrose limit. 


T-duality on parallelizable pp-waves 


In this section we study T-duality on the  s  introduced in 
previous sections. In general, in order to perform T-duality, we first need to 
compactify the manifold and for (toroidal) compactifications of any 
manifold we require translations  along the compactification 
directions to be  (space-like) isometries of the manifold.
The existence of translation isometry along a space-like direction for the 
 as written 
in eq. (), is not manifest.
However, the plane-wave solutions generically possess non-linearly 
realized symmetries and there is a chance that in a proper coordinate 
system some isometries which are hidden may become manifest. 
This is indeed the case. To see this, following Michelson 
, let us consider the "rotating" frame
X^1=x^1 (a_1 u) -x^2 (a_1 u)  , X^2=x^2 (a_1 u) +x^1 (a_1 u)  ,
leaving all the other coordinates unchanged, i.e.
U=u ,   V =v ,  X^i=x^i  i 3 .
The metric in the new coordiantes becomes
T1metric 
  ds^2 &= &-2  dU d V  + dX^1dX^1+ dX^2 dX^2+ _i=3 ^8 dX^i 
dX^i
 
&-& [a_2^2 (X_3^2 + X_4^2) +a_3^2 (X_5^2 + X_6^2) +a_4^2 (X_7^2 + 
X_8^2)] 
dU^2  
-2a_1 (X^1dX^2-X^2dX^1)dU  ,
while the -field remains invariant, i.e. .
It is evident that we can make the same transformation  
for all the other coordiantes and remove the  term of the metric 
completely; then we get a metric which has  term proportional to 
. The translational symmetry is not manifest yet, to see that 
let us redefine(
We remind the reader that, as far as the metric is concerned, 
to make the isometry along a direction, say , manifest, the 
frame we choose can be rotating clockwise or counter-clockwise. However, 
due to the presence of a -field in our case, there is a preferred 
orientation.) 



and the metric becomes
T2metric 
  ds^2 &=& -2  dU dV   + _i=1 ^8  dX^i dX^i && - [a_2^2 (X_3^2 + X_4^2) +a_3^2 (X_5^2 + X_6^2) +a_4^2 (X_7^2 + 
X_8^2)] dU^2  +4a_1 X^2dX^1dU  .
Now we are ready to compactify  on a circle and use Bucher's 
rules to perform T-dualityg^T_ &=&g_ -1 g_11  (
g_1 g_1 -B_1 B_1  ) B^T_ &=&B_ +21 g_11  (g_1 B_
1 -B_1 g_1  ) g^T_1 &=&B_1  g_11   , 
B^T_1 =g_1  g_11   ,
In our case( Given  there is a  gauge freedom in the 
definition of  and we choose the gauge which is compatible with the 
translational symmetry along .) 
TB 
B_1 = g_1 = 2a_1  X^2 _U  .
Choosing , i.e., sitting at the self-dual radius, we find
B^T_ =B_  &,&  g^T_ =g_ , B^T_1 =g_1  &,&  g^T_1 =B_1  .
As we see, the  and  fields are exactly the same before and after 
T-duality; in other words  s are invariant under T-duality.
 This invariance is a direct consequence of the specific form of our 
metric and -field, namely, , which is dictated by 
.

So far, we have shown that any   solution of type IIB is also a 
solution of IIA, related by T-duality. In the above 
arguments we have only considered the bosonic fields  and .
One should also consider fermions and check if the above
T-duality invariance also holds in the fermionic sector. 
First, we note that the two 
conserved supersymmetries of the IIB 
background have the same chirality, while those of IIA have 
different chiralities. Compactification imposes a boundary condition 
on fermions, which is not necessarily compatible with their chirality and 
as a result, the number of  may change under T-duality.
While individual supersymmetries may be affected by compactification,
the total number of kinematical  (16) is not, and hence
16 such supercharges survive compactification and T-duality.
The difference between IIB and IIA only arises
in the non-kinematical .  
If the number of supercharges of a type IIA
 is  (), then the corresponding T-dual 
IIB solution  
has ; the  depends on the "orientation" with
respect to the H-field.
Because of the existence 
of a non-trivial H-field, the two different orientations on the compactification 
circle lead to two different solutions, differing by the number of 
. For the  () cases, after T-duality we 
have  or . Which of these 
cases we obtain depends on the details of the  solution. 
Therefore, invariance under 
T-duality can only be exact (in the sense that it holds in both 
bosonic and fermionic sectors) for ,  
 and . As examples of these  cases we
mention the  coming as the Penrose limit of  
() and  () 
solutions.




String theory on parallelizable pp-waves 


As noted in, the string theory (sigma model) on a generic 
homogeneous  is solvable in the light-cone gauge. Inthe interest was mainly in backgrounds with
non-zero RR flux. In this section we formulate string theory on s
and show that, in this case, string theory is simpler than the 
generic plane-wave with RR flux. The formulation of string theory on some 
special s, namely those coming from the Penrose limit of 
 and its variants, have been previously considered in
, although the connection to  was not made.
We first focus on the bosonic sector of strings and in the next
section study fermions in the Green-Schwarz (GS) formulation.
However, since our backgrounds are only 
in the NS-NS sector, the RNS formulation can also be used. 


Bosonic sector 


The non-linear sigma model in the NS-NS background of 
 and  fields is given by
S=-1 4d^2 -g  (
g^ab  G_  _a X^_b X^+^ab  B_  _a X^_b X^) ,
where  and  is the worldsheet metric. For the background 
defined through eqs. (,,), we have
 
S=-1 4d^2-g  [
g^ab  (-2_a U_b V
&-1 4  h_ik h_jk  X^i X^j _a U_b U+
 _a X^i_b X^i ) 

&+^ab  h_ij  X^j _a U_b X^i]
 .
We next fix the conformal symmetry in the gauge
 and , and to avoid 
ghosts we choose light-cone gauge, in which
lightconegauge 
_U=p^+=const.
Then  is constrained to satisfy
Vconstraints 
p^+_V &=& _X^i _X^i , 2p^+_V &=& _X^i _X^i +
_X^i _X^i - 1 4 (p^+)^2 
h_ik h_jk X^iX^j .
Plugging the above into the action (), the light-cone 
action for the transverse modes  is seen to be
LCaction 
S_LC  &=& 1 4d^2[
_X^i_X^i -_X^i_X^i
-p^+ ^2 4  h_ik h_jk  X^i X^j 
- p^+ h_ij  X^j _X^i]  &=& 1 4d^2[
(_X^i)^2-(_
X^i+p^+ 2 h_ij X^j)^2] .
Without loss of generality we can take the 's as in 
equation (). Since the analysis for the different modes is quite 
similar, here we only focus on the  components, whose   are
eomX 
(_^2-_^2)X^i +(a_1p^+) ^2 X^i 
-2a_1p^+ _ij _X^j =0 ,   i,j=1,2 .
The above equation is solved by  
where
B-freq 
^ _n=2n a_1p^+  ,
and the closed string boundary conditions
closedBC 
X^i()=X^i(+)  ,
fixes  to be integer. Therefore, the most generic solution to 
equation () can be written as
 
 
for the right-movers, and for the left-moves
 
 
The reality of 's implies that
reality 
(_n^R)^-n ^R ,  (_n^L)^-n ^L ,
and .

Note that for a generic , there is no zero-mode and the mode 
expansions of (,) can be used without 
ambiguity. For , however, we have zero 
frequency modes; for such cases one may extract the zero-modes:
 
  
 
In these cases, for a constant  slice in the 
 plane, the string forms a circle of radius 
, with some wiggles superposed
on it.
To understand the physics of such strings it is helpful to work out the 
angular momentum of the center of mass of the string:
angular 
L=1  _0^(X^1_X^2- X^2_
X^1) d=x^1p^2-x^2p^1 ,
which is constant. In this case strings are circles whose
radius grows with time, while carrying constant angular momentum.
This is as expected if we note that the NS-NS field acts like a magnetic field. 
However, the effect of  terms in the background metric
appears in the fact that the  terms in ()
are multiplied by  and  factors, i.e.,
the center of mass of a string on the average has zero momentum and is 
confined to stay around . Similar behaviour have been observed for 
other s (e.g. see). 

One of the remarkable differences between our case and the other plane-waves
(which involve RR fluxes), is that the spacing between the energy 
levels in our case is just given by integers (in other words 
 is a linear function of ).

We would like to point out that due to the presence of background 
fields, the light-cone Hamiltonian differs from , 
explicitly
LChamiltonian 
H_LC = _+ &=& 
d (_V + p^+a_1^2 X_i^2+ a_1_ij X^i_X^j)  &=&1 2p^+  d [(_X^i)^2 
+(_X^i+p^+ a_1_ij X^j)^2] &=& 1 2p^+  _nZ   
_n^R_-n ^R+_n^R_-n ^R+ 
_n^L_-n ^L+_n^L_-n ^L .
Note that the last line of the above equation is written for 
. For integer values of 
, one should add  to the sum over 
oscillators.

Given the mode expansions, we can proceed with the quantization of strings by imposing
quant 
[X^i(),X^j(,  [P^i(),P^j(,  
[X^i(),P^j(ij (,
with , leading to
modequant 
[^R_n,^R_m]= [^L_n,^L_m]= _n^-_m+n   ,
and all the other combinations commuting. For the cases where we have "zero-modes" 
(), . The above 
mode expansion and commutators is similar to the twisted sector of strings on 
orbifolds.
Using the commutation relations () we can write the
Hamiltonian in a normal ordered form
H_LC = 1 2p^+  _i=1 ^4_n 0  
_-n i ^R_n i ^R+_-n i ^R_n i ^R+ 
_-n i ^L_n i ^L+_-n i ^L_n i ^L+ E_0 ,
where  is the zero point energy coming from regularizing sums 
like , and has value
E0 
E_0=-2 3 -_i=1 ^4 ^2_i   ,
where  are the non-integer part of , i.e. 
. 







Fermionic sector 


The fermionic NS-NS sector of the Green-Schwarz action, expanded to second order(
Terms of higher order do not contribute
in light-cone gauge.) 
in the fermions, for type IIA string theory is
S_F  = i ^   d^2^ab  _a X^_D _b  ,
with ,
 the pull-back of the superspace covariant derivative
with torsion
D _a  =  D_a  +  1 8  _a X^^ 
_3 H_   ,
and the normal covariant derivative 
D_a  =  _a  +  1 4  (_a X^) _^ab 
_ab 
contains the spin connection .
The NS-NS sector of the IIB Green-Schwarz action is the same as that presented
above, with the difference in the solutions arising from the chirality of the
two spinors, as in the discussion of supersymmetry counting in section .

We work in light-cone gauge, where we impose the conditions
X^+=p^+  ,            -h  h^ab =^ab   ,
and fix the  symmetry by imposing the additional constraint
, giving
S_F  = - i p^+ ^   d^2^-
( D __0  +  D __3 )
 ,
with
 
 
yielding the following form for the fermionic action
S_F  = - i p^+ ^   d^22  ( ^1 ^- _+ ^1 +
^2 ^- _- ^- )
-p^+ 8  (
^1 ^- ^IJ  ^1
- ^2 ^- ^IJ  ^2 )
H_+IJ   ,
where  range over the transverse directions, and
.
Precisely half the components of the fermions
have been projected out by the gauge fixing to leave
only the physical degrees of freedom.
The equations of motion are
 
 
which do not couple  to , but do mix components
within the individual fermions.



The closed string boundary conditions are
^1,^2 _ =  
^1,^2 _We solve the equations of motion fermion:eom  by
separating the solution in light-cone coordinates, then expanding the
solution into a complete set of functions. The ansatz is








with  and  constant spinors which are
subject to the gauge fixing condition.
Introducing the mass matrix ,
with the matrix
 written out in equation H:contraction ,
we have
 
 
which are a pair of eigenvalue equations for  and .
Imposing the boundary condition bc , we see that
m_1   2 Z +n_1  ,          
m_2   2 Z +n_2  .
The final mode expansions are
 
 
The reality condition implies that
( ^_m_,n_  )^ = 
^_-m_,-n_   .
Upon quantization 




It is straightforward to work out the light-cone Hamiltonian for the 
fermionic modes
H_LC =1 2p^+ _m_0  (^)^m_^E_0  ,
where  is the zero point energy and is defined in eq. (). As 
we expect, the bosonic and fermionic zero point energies are the same 
up to a sign and hence there is no total zero point energy in the 
spectrum, a confirmation of the  of the background.

The  solutions we are considering are parameterized by four
constants, as in foura .
As an example, consider the background with . This background
preserves 22 supercharges in type IIA and either 16 or 28 supercharges in type IIB,
depending on whether the spinors are chosen to be both left-handed or right-handed,
respectively.
The mass matrix for this configuration is
M=a_1  p^+ 4   diag(1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,0,2,-2,0,0,0,0,0) ,
where we only need to consider the half of the mass matrix acting on the subspace
surviving the gauge fixing.
Now, for the modes for which the mass vanishes, equation eigenvalue:equations 
implies the existence of zero-modes.
After fixing the  symmetry by imposing the gauge ,
the counting of the zero-modes for the physical degrees of freedom
parallels the counting of the non-kinematical supercharges presented in section
. The number of zero-modes depends on whether we are working
with type IIA or IIB, and in type type IIB, whether we choose both spinors
to be left-handed or right-handed.  The number of zero-modes can be ascertained
by looking at tables 1 and 2, subtracting 16 for the standard kinematical supersymmetries,
which in the present discussion correspond to the modes orthogonal to those
removed by the gauge fixing. This leads to a subtlety, which is that the number of
zero-modes coming from left handed spinors  here are associated with the number
of non-kinematical supercharges (for counting purposes only)
for right handed spinors in section ,
and vice-verse. The total counting in type IIA, of course, is the same.
Therefore, for this example, there are 6 zero-modes
in type IIA and zero (both spinors right-handed) or 12 (both left-handed)
zero-modes in type IIB.

The example ,
with  defined in define:r , arising as
the Penrose limit of ,
is half supersymmetric, preserving
16 supercharges in both type IIA and IIB, and as a result, the fermionic solutions
exhibit no zero-modes. The mass matrix is
M=p^+ 8 r^2   diag(r^2-1,r^2-1,r^2+3,r^2-1,r^2+1,r^2-3,r^2+1,r^2+1) .
This analysis can be extended to other configurations, with the general result that the
number of zero-modes, in the solutions to the fermionic sector, is equal to the number of non-kinematical supercharges preserved by the background, taking account of the type IIB reversal
discussed above.


Compactification and T-duality 



In section 5 we studied T-duality of s at the  level. In this 
section we extend the T-duality analysis to string theory.
As we will see, because of the nature of the background, only   
right-movers contribute to the center of mass modes. This, and other peculiar features of 
strings under T-duality will be examined in this section.

We begin by writing the sigma model action in the  after a Michelson 
rotation, i.e., the background given in eqs. (),(). 
After fixing the light-cone gauge:
TLCaction 
S _LC  = 1 4d^2[
_^i_^i -_^i_^i
-4 p^+ a_1 ^2 (_^1+_^1)]  ,
where we have only presented the action for the  components, the 
other 's are similar and here we skip them. The  are
TeomX 
(_^2-_^2)^i 
-2a_1p^+ _ij (_^j+_^j) =0 ,   
i,j=1,2 .
Inserting 
we find
Tfreq 
   or    ^ _n=2n2a_1p^+ .
Imposing the closed string boundary conditions restricts  to the 
integers. Then the mode expansions are
 
 
for the right-movers and(For , there is a 
"zero-mode" for left-movers, which should be extracted in a manner similar to
eq. (). 

) 
 
 
for the left-movers.
We see that only the right movers have the usual momentum mode. Note also 
that for the non-compact case, 
, resulting from the boundary conditions, 

Next, we quantize the strings by imposing the usual commutation relations
(), where now the conjugate momenta to  are
 
 
The canonical quantization conditions lead to
Tmodequant 
[^1,^2]=-i 2p^+a_1    &,& [^i ,^j]=0 ,   [^1,^2]=0 , [^R_n,^R_m]=[^R_n,^R_m]=-4n^3 4n^2-(p^+ a_1)^2 _m+n  
&,&  
[^R_n,^R_m]=ip^+a_12n^2 4n^2-(p^+ a_1)^2 _m+n  , [^L_n,^L_m]=[^L_n,^L_m]=0 & , &   
[^L_n,^L_m]=4(n+p^+a_1)^2 2n+p^+a_1  _m+n  .
We note that the "zero-modes", , have unusual commutation relations, e.g.
, and also the zero-modes of  and  are 
non-commuting.
  
We would like to stress that in the rotating frame coordinates, the 
light-cone constraints are different from the usual ones
 
 
and the light-cone Hamiltonian is
H _LC =1 2p^+ d[(_^i)^2+
(_^i)^2 +4p^+a_1 ^2_^1] .
Now we proceed with compactification. Although from the solutions TRightmovers 
and TLeftmovers ,
it may seem that both the  and  directions can have zero-modes (i.e., we have 
translational symmetry along  and  at the level of the TeomX ), 
it is only possible to compactify the system along the  direction. This can be seen from
equations  Tmomenta  or TVconstraints .
Putting  on a circle of radius ,  can become non-zero as a winding mode
^1=w_1 R_1 ,   w_1Z  ,

while  is still zero as a result of the closed strings boundary conditions.

Since , there is no extra quantization condition on  due to the 
momentum modes. In fact the momentum conjugate to  is  and it should 
have a discrete spectrum.
Noting that  are the center of mass coordinates of strings along 
,  means that the  space is a non-commutative cylinder 
where  is along the axis, its radius is  and the fuzziness is
proportional to . As discussed in,  has a
discrete spectrum,  with . Upon 
T-dualizing along  and exchanging  with , it is easy to show that 
the Hamiltonian remains unchanged if we also exchange  with the winding . 
In the fermionic sector as usual, duality acts by changing the chirality of one of the
fermions. As we have argued in previous sections, this may change the number of 
supersymmetries.


D-Branes on parallelizable plane-waves 


In this section we study the existence of BPS -branes in s
backgrounds. -branes have been studied in various plane-wave 
backgrounds (e.g. see). In 
general 
there are two ways of addressing the question of -branes, one is 
through open strings with Dirichlet boundary conditions, as it was first 
introduced in, or through closed strings and the boundary 
state formulation
.  Here we follow the construction via open strings.  As we 
will show, due to presence of the -field, three different situations can arise.








To start with, let us focus on the bosonic modes. First we note that, as
is evident from eq. (),  
the light-cone gauge condition fixes the boundary condition the or   
component to be Neumann. Therefore,  lies inside the worldvolume of all 
-branes we are going to study. As for the other components, we 
start with the light-cone action (). This leads to the  
eq. () and the boundary conditions
BC 
dX^i (_X^i +p^+ a_1^ij  
X_j)_  .
Since the argument for 's along the directions where there is an 
-field present is similar, here we consider  and the  
plane only. If some of the 's in () are zero, the 
situation is of course the same as for flat space.

One can recognize three possibilities:
 
[i )]  and  are both transverse to brane.
[ii )]  and  are both inside the brane.
[iii )] Only  or  is along the brane brane.

Since these cases have been mentioned in, we will be 
very brief with them.

i ) This case is realized by imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions 
on both  and , i.e., . The boundary 
conditions force the frequency of the string modes to be integer valued 
and hence
 
 
 
(Once  we have extra zero-modes.)
Upon quantization we find
[_n,_m]=[_m,_n]=n_m+n  .
In this case the  direction also satisfies a Neumann boundary condition 
and hence lies inside the brane. The brane is located in such a way that  
only has one leg along the brane. As discussed in, 
the theory living on such branes is a "dipole" gauge theory. As seen 
from the above mode expansions, these branes are stuck at . 
In general, following, it is straightforward 
to show that these branes preserve half of the kinematical and half of the
non-kinematical supersymmetries.

ii)  In this case, to satisfy the boundary conditions we demand 
that
NBC 
_X^i +p^+ a_1^ij  
X_j_ =0 ,
which is a modified Neumann boundary condition. It is  
well known that the existence of a background -field will change the boundary 
conditions. The  direction should also 
satisfy a modified boundary condition
VNBC 
_V +p^+ a_1^ij  
X_j_ X^j_ =0 .
The modified boundary conditions () and () may be 
understood from the fact that the brane now contains , and the 
 field (which lies completely inside the brane) can be treated as a
background electric field equal to  on the brane. For the 
low energy theory on such branes we expect to find just a gauge theory with 
a non-constant background electric field. 

The frequencies of the normal modes satisfy the boundary conditions 
(), similar to the case i) , and are found to be integer valued 
and hence the mode expansions are
 
 
 

iii)  In this case, we demand that  satisfy Neumann b.c.'s, 
 and  to satisfy Dirichelet b.c.'s,
. It is not hard to check that, as a result,  
must satisfy the usual Neumann boundary condition, 
.
One of the differences between this case and the previous two cases is 
that the frequencies of the string modes are now non-integer  
openstringfreq 
^ _n=np^+a_1  ,
with the mode expansions
 
 
with the reality condition .
Imposing the quantization conditions ()
leads to
openquant 
[_n,_m]=_n^+ _m+n  .
We should note that the above mode expansion is for 
. For integer values of , however, we have a zero-mode
and the expansion is 
 
 
where upon quantization we obtain .

In this case the brane is located so that the  field has two legs 
along the brane and one transverse to it. In the gauge 
, the -field resides completely inside the brane, 
however, the value of the -field is zero exactly on the brane which is 
necessarily at . Again the -field can be understood as a 
background electric field on the brane, which is now proportional to one 
of the scalar fields (the "transverse" directions to the brane). This in 
particular gives a mass to that scalar field, so that its lowest 
excitation is no longer massless. This can also be observed from the 
mode expansion (). A more detailed analysis of the 
theory living on these branes is postponed to future works.    

In principle, one can also work out the fermionic modes, but since the 
computations are very similar to those which appear in, we do 
not present them here.

Finally, we would like to note that it is possible to have a combination of 
the three cases discussed above. For example, in the the background ,
with 28 supersymmetries, we might have a D5-brane along 
the  directions, a mixture of all three cases.  



Discussion 


In this paper we classified and studied, to some extent, the s.
We first briefly studied 
implications of  for a general  solution and proved that the 
vanishing of the gravitino variation for  backgrounds can be solved with 32
independent solution. One should note that the converse is not true,
that is, not all the cases for which the gravitino variation has 32 
solutions are parallelizable, for example, the famous  
background.
 



 
Strings on  have been studied in detail using the SL(2,)
group manifold and the corresponding Kac-Moodi algebra. 
It would be very interesting to extend the definition of the 
WZW models and the Maldacena-Ooguri setup to the  case; although it 
is not a group manifold, it has a nice (non-associative) algebraic (octonionic)
structure.

We then turned to s and proved that all  s are 
necessarily homogeneous s and the converse is true if the  
in the  term () has doubly degenerate eigenvalues.
The s may be classified by their , where for type IIB
the maximal  is 28 and the others differ by steps of four (down to 16), 
while type IIA  
may have 24, 22, 20, 18 and 16 supercharges. 
We also discussed the invariance of the bosonic sector of s under 
T-duality and discussed how the fermions and number of supercharges may change 
under T-duality.

We studied string theory on the  backgrounds and showed that the
sigma model is simpler than for other  backgrounds.
This simplicity might help in working out the vertex operators, making it possible
to study string scattering processes and to evaluate the S-matrix elements, whose
existence for  backgrounds has been argued in.
Working out the proper vertex operators and string scattering amplitudes
is another interesting open question we postpone to future works. 

We also very briefly discussed the half BPS -branes and the 
restrictions on the possible Dirichelet or Neumann boundary conditions 
arising from  backgrounds. The classification of possible 
-branes, branes at angles, intersecting branes and most importantly,
the theory residing on branes in the  backgrounds and 
the corresponding  solutions, along the lines of,
deserve 
more detailed analysis.

  APPENDIX - Conventions   


We briefly review our conventions in this appendix. We use the mostly plus metric.
Greek indices  range over the curved (world) indices, while 
Latin indices
 denote tangent space indices and  label coordinates on the
space transverse to the light-cone directions.
The curved space Gamma matrices are defined via contraction with vierbeins
as usual, .

We may rewrite the two Majorana-Weyl spinors in ten dimensional type IIA and IIB theories
as a pair of Majorana spinors ,
subject to the chirality conditions appropriate to the theory,
^11   ^1  =  +  ^1  ,          
^11   ^2  =   ^2  ,
where for the second spinor we choose  for non-chiral type IIA
and  for chiral type IIB theories, and treat the index  labeling the
spinor as an SL(2,) index. Where Pauli matrices appear, they
act on this auxiliary index, with
 acting analogously to the chirality operator in type IIA.























In what follows, we suppress the spinor index as well as
the auxiliary index.








Type II string theories contain two Majorana-Weyl gravitinos
, , which are of the same (opposite) chirality in IIB 
(IIA).
The supersymmetry variation of these gravitinos in string frame is
_ =  D  _  
,
where the supercovariant derivative is defined asD  _  =
_

+1 8  
_3 ^ab  H_ab  -
1 16  e^ (_3 ^ab  
F_ab -1 12 ^abcd  F_abcd ) 
_ ,
for type IIA theory and 
D  _  =
_
+1 8  
_3 ^ab  H_ab 
+i 8  e^ (_2 ^a  
_a i 6  
_1^abc F_abc +1 240  
_2 ^abcde F_abcde 
) _ ,
for type IIB, with the spin connection  appearing in the covariant derivative

.
In these expressions,  is the dilaton,  is the axion,  the three-form
field strength from the NS-NS sector, and the 's represent the appropriate RR
field strengths.

For pure NS-NS backgrounds relevant to this paper, the dilatino variation for
both types IIA and IIB, is
 = 
(
1 2  ^a ( _a )
 -  1 4  ^abc  H_abc  _3
)  .























A convenient choice of basis for
 Dirac matrices, which we denote by , 
can be written in terms of 
matrices  such that
  ^+   = 
  i
  (
   
     0 & 2   

     0 & 0
    ) ,
     
  ^-   = 
  i
  (
   
     0 & 0 

     2  & 0
    ) ,
     
  ^i   = 
  (
   
     ^i & 0 

     0 & - ^i
    ) ,
     
  ^11   = 
  (
   
     ^(8)  & 0 

     0 & -^(8) 
    )  ,
and the  satisfying  with 
the metric on the transverse space.
Choosing a chiral basis for the 's, we have
.
The above matrices satisfy
 
(^+)^ =  - ^- ,     
(^-)^ &=  - ^+ ,     
(^+)^2 = (^-)^2 = 0 , 

[ ^+ , ] = 0 ,     
 ^11  , ^  =  & 0 ,     
 ^11  , ^i    =  0 ,     
[ ^, ^ij  ]  = 0  ,
and
 if the same signs appearing
on both sides.





We define light-cone coordinates
 and likewise for the
light-like Gamma matrices ,


and also define antisymmetric products of  matrices with weight one,
,
choosing for the  matrices a representation such that
 
 3 
  ^12   &=  &i 
  diag(++-,++-,++-,++-)  ,

  ^34   &=  -&i 
  diag(++-,-++,++-,-++)  , 

  ^56   &=  &i 
  diag(+-+-,+-+-,+-+-,+-+-)  , 

  ^78   &=  -&i 
  diag(+-+-,-+-+,-+-+,+-+-)  ,
for which
  ^12345678    ^(8)   = 
  diag(++++,++++,--,--)  .
The following combination appears in the paper,
which we write using the results of section  (in particular foura ),
 
^ij  H_+ij   = 
(
 
^ij  H_+ij  & 0 

0 & ^ij  H_+ij 
)  ,
and
 
^ij  H_+ij   &= 
2 ( a_1 ^12  + a_2 ^34  + a_3 ^56  + a_4 ^78  ) 

&=  2 i 
diag(c_1,c_2,-c_2,-c_1, c_3,c_4,-c_4,-c_3, c_5,c_6,-c_6,-c_5, c_7,c_8,-c_8,-c_7)  ,
where we also define the constants

Penrose limits
------

The penrose limit is constructed as follows:
starting with a solution of the Einstein equations, we zoom in on the neighborhood
of a null geodesic by choosing coordinates adapted to the it and then scaling
the metric by a constant factor in such a way that the neighborhood of the
null geodesic is expanded off to infinity. Taking advantage of the homogeneous
scaling of the lagrangian under this transformation, we see that any solutions
of the field equations remain solutions of the same equations after the limit.
.
This procedure always generates a plane-wave space-time which solves Einstein's
equations, and generically can have non-zero curvature.

The Weyl tensor of any plane-wave is either null or vanishes.

Gueven has generalized the Penrose limitto the low energy effective field theories arising from the five
superstring theorires, with NS-NS, RR and Yang-Mills potentials,
and demonstrated that the leading order 

The solutions after the plane-wave limit possess at least as much
supersymmetry as the original solution, but may also exhibit an
enhancement of the number of killing spinors.  In particular, there is a
minimum amount of supersymmetry after the limit (see also
).










For plane-wave backgrounds where RR flux is present, the supersymmetry is
typically determined by the gravitino susy variations, with the dilatino variations
giving a redundant counting.
For a constant dilaton plane-wave background supporting only NS-NS flux,
the supersymmetry is determined completely by the dilatino susy variation,
the gravitino variations being redundant.  





We present here a brief recapitulation of relevent earlier work on
non-linear sigma models and their renormalization.
In, a simple geometrical interpretation was given
for the renormalization group flow in certain supersymmetric non-linear sigma models
where Wess-Zumino
 terms are present.  These terms were interpreted as the
addition of torsion to the connection on the target manifold.
The renormalization flow can be interpreted as a geometrical deformation
of the target space manifold.  When Wess-Zumino terms are absent,
the geometric flow depends on the Riemannian curvature of the target
manifold.  
With the addition of Wess-Zumino terms, a similar interpretation
may be given, however, the curvature in this case is derived from a
connection with torsion.
In the case of Wess-Zumino-Witten models, where the target
space is a group manifold, the torsion is derived from the structure
constants of the Lie group.
The genralized connection with torsion
constructed in this manner may "flatten"
the manifold, i.e. cause the curvature to vanish.
In this case the manifold is said to be parallelized,
An interesting result of this parallelization is the existence of renormalization
group fixed points whose origin is given a geometrical interpretation.



The metric () is in Brinkman form.
It can be put into a form which makes the extra planar symmetry
manifest
 
This is known as the Rosen form of the metric.
It suffer from the deficiency that it is has coordinated
singularities where  vanishes, and Rosenhas shown that non-flat vacuum metric in this form 
posesses singularities when the range of the coordinate system is 
extended to cover the whole space-time. However, such singularities are
only coordinate singularities and can be evaded through the use of

As we will see, choosing the torsion to equal the
NS three form field strength with an appropriate normalization
allows us to write the supergravity equations of motions as

The parallel with string theory, where a similar Wess-Zumino term arises 
in the covariant superstring action,
corresponding to the antisymmetric NS B-field,
will be exploited in this paper.
As discussed in, such
parallelism in a supersymmetric non-linear sigma model
may lead to a conformally invariant fixed point in the
renormalization group flow, and can be seen to have a geometrical
nature when interpreted in terms of the generalized connection.
The normalization of the Wess-Zumino term is fixed by local
supersymmetry on the worldsheet, and yields a torsion which
parallelizes the target space, leading again to interesteing non-trivial
fixed points. The persistence of such fixed points to two-loop order
has been demonstrated in the supersymmetric case by
, where it is also conjectured to
survive to all orders in perturbation theory via a local equivalence
to free field theories at these fixed points.
 demonstrated the on-shell ultraviolet finiteness
of non-linear sigma models with Wess-Zumino terms that parallelize
the target space manifold, to all orders in perturbation theory.




The dynamics of the massless sector of string theory at low energy
is described by an effective theory taking the form of a supergravity
theory on the target space-time of the string -model.
Two approaches to establishing this effective action exist.
In the first approach,
one may write the most general action reflecting the space-time
symmetries of the massless modes of the string theory.
Tree-level (in ) S-matrix computations are then performed in the string
theory, at some loop order in . The coefficients
appearing in the space-time effective action are then fixed by the
requirement that scattering at low energy in the two theories
coincide. Solutions of the equations of motion of for this effective theory
might display a perturbative nature in .
The second approach is to compute the renormalization group
 functions (or Weyl anomaly ) for the couplings in the string -model.
The requirement of Weyl invariance of the string theory, in the
form of the vanishing of the  function (again, to some order
in -model perturbation theory), then yields the
equations of motion which can then be used to construct the low-energy
supergravity effective action. The couplings of the worlsheet theory
appear as the fundamental fields in the supergravity action.

Metsaev and Tseytlin
 have demonstrated that parallelizable spaces
yield solutions of the string effective action
to order , and have also shown that the
effective action can be recast in a form involving the curvature
derived from a generalized connection with the addition of torsion
(the so called "string torsion"),
arising from the sigma model Wess-Zumino antisymmetric coupling.
The two-loop correction to the  function for a metric corresponding
to a parallelizable target space manifold is
shown to vanish in a particular renormalization scheme, and for a
deformation of the manifold in other renormalization schemes.
