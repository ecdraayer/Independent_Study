ABSTRACT 
We investigate the possibility of having an event horizon within several
classes of metrics that asymptote to the maximally supersymmetric IIB
plane wave. We show that the presence of a null Killing vector (not
necessarily covariantly constant) implies an effective separation of the
Einstein equations into a standard and a wave component.  This feature
may be used to generate new supergravity solutions asymptotic to the
maximally supersymmetric IIB plane wave, starting from standard seed
solutions such as branes or intersecting branes in flat space.  We find
that in many cases it is possible to preserve the extremal horizon of
the seed solution.  On the other hand, non-extremal deformations of the
plane wave solution result in naked singularities.  More generally, 
we prove a no-go theorem against the existence of horizons for backgrounds
with a null Killing vector and which contain at most null matter fields.
Further attempts at turning on a nonzero Hawking temperature by
introducing additional matter have proven unsuccessful.
This suggests that one must remove the null Killing vector in order to
obtain a horizon.  We provide a perturbative argument indicating that
this is in fact possible.




Introduction 


Black holes play a special role in our understanding of nature: Arising
as classical solutions to  gravity equations they pose challenging
questions at the quantum level. In the framework of general relativity
the best understood situations pertain to asymptotically flat black
holes. Motivated by the AdS/CFT correspondence interest has
been directed to the study of black holes that asymptote to AdS. These
black holes have properties that fundamentally distinguish them from
asymptotically flat black holes, like the possibility of a positive
specific heat. Some of the properties of the simplest black hole
in this class - the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole - were  studied in
.  Most of the properties of asymptotically AdS black
holes have received beautiful interpretations in the framework of
the AdS/CFT correspondence. In particular, Witten argued that the
Hawking-Page phase transition is the supergravity dual effect to the
confinement/deconfinement phase transition for gauge theories on the
sphere. Other properties of black holes asymptoting to AdS
have been discussed in the literature (see for example).

Recently Berenstein, Maldacena and Nastase (BMN) have
proposed a correspondence between a limit of the  AdS
IIB background and a subsector of operators of  Super
Yang-Mills. The limit on the IIB supergravity side is the maximally
supersymmetric plane wave background with constant null RR five-form
(the BFHP solution)
ds^2&=&-4 dx^+dx^- -116 ^2 z_iz^i (dx^+)^2+ dz_idz^i, 

F_+1234 &=&F_+5678 =.

This solution is the analogue of the maximally supersymmetric plane wave
of 11 dimensional supergravity.

One of the natural questions that arises from the BMN construction relates
to the nonzero temperature deformation of the correspondence, much in the
same way that the  AdS/CFT correspondence extends to nonzero temperature
. On the string theory side some progress in formulating the
correspondence has been achieved. Exploiting the fact that the maximally
supersymmetric IIB plane wave is exactly solvable in the light-cone gauge
,  the thermal partition function has been calculated
and shown to display a Hagedorn temperature depending on
the parameter  above. This nontrivial dependence of the Hagedorn
temperature makes the possibility of a phase transition even more
tantalizing. Many natural questions however, remained unanswered. In
particular, the structure of the analogue of the Schwarzschild-AdS black
hole in the context of plane waves is not known. More generally: What are
the properties of black holes that asymptote to the homogeneous plane
wave spacetime?

The question of the Schwarzschild black hole asymptoting to
the BFHP plane wave has been addressed from different angles
. In it was made explicit
that the answer can not come from a Penrose limit of the Schwarzschild-AdS
black hole. This was further elaborated upon in where it
was also shown  that the existence of a covariantly constant
null Killing vector is an obstruction to having an event horizon. In
 a further study of asymptotically plane wave spacetimes was
carried out and some solutions were presented using the Garfinkle-Vachaspati
method (see also).

In this paper we investigate various possibilities for introducing event
horizons in geometries that asymptote to the BFHP plane wave. We
consider two fundamentally different classes of solutions: extremal and
nonextremal. More precisely, we describe solutions with
zero  Hawking temperature and attempt to generalize them to solutions
with nonzero Hawking temperature.

To construct the first class of solutions, that is, zero temperature
black objects containing an event horizon and asymptoting to the BFHP
plane wave, we make use of a separation property of backgrounds with
a null Killing vector.  Namely, we consider metrics that generalize the
BFHP plane wave while maintaining a null Killing vector:

 

where ,  and  are in
general functions of all transverse coordinates .
A crucial observation that may be used to establish various properties
is the fact that the Ricci tensor decomposesinto standard and plane wave components:

 

where  is computed from () when  and
.

A very natural way to exploit the property () is to use it as
a solution generating mechanism. Given that only the  component
of the Ricci tensor is modified, this
allows for the possibility of "superposing" a plane wave on top of a
given solution. Namely, finding a suitable matter contribution 
 we can generalize a given supergravity solution with  to a
new solution with . Imposing that asymptotically 
 and that  approaches the form of () we
construct solutions that asymptote to the BFHP plane wave. 

Along the lines of the solution generating point of view we can reinterpret
the BFHP solution as the  -deformation of flat space. Under this scope
we review the construction of D branes and more importantly, we obtain new
solutions corresponding to -deforming intersecting branes. We find
it possible in some cases to arrange for the -deformation to keep the
regular horizon
characteristic of the seed solutions while changing the solutions
asymptotically to that of BFHP for large . This way we present a
class of solutions that asymptote to the BFHP plane wave and have
regular event horizons.

We then attempt to further generalize such solutions to include an event
horizon corresponding to nonzero Hawking temperature. We study possible
generalizations under various symmetry requirements. In particular we
consider  and  generalizations of the BFHP
solution. We find that in the presence of a null Killing vector such
generalizations yield singular solutions. Using the separation
property of the Ricci tensor (), we show that generalizations
of the BFHP solution keeping a null Killing vector and with arbitrary
splitting of the transverse directions can not lead to a smooth
horizon. Following the expectations raised in the zero temperature case
we go on to consider nonzero Hawking temperature generalizations of the
-deformed branes and intersecting brane solutions. We find however,
that all such generalizations yield singular event horizons.

Having identified the main obstruction to having a nonzero Hawking
temperature event horizon as the presence of a null Killing vector,
we consider a perturbative argument in favor of the existence of such
solutions once the null Killing vector is removed. Namely, we consider
the black string in ten dimensions and discuss the conditions for turning
on a RR 5-form. We find, neglecting backreaction, compatibility between
the Bianchi identity and the asymptotic conditions. Moreover, we show
explicitly that the backreaction is under control.

Because of our interest in identifying regular event horizons, we begin
in section 2 with an analysis of the horizon structure in generalized
plane wave backgrounds.  In section 3, we exploit the separation property
of the Ricci tensor to construct new multiple charge solutions
with zero temperature, including a deformation of the well-known D1-D5
system.  Then, in section 4, we investigate the possibility of finding
solutions with non-zero temperature.  We find that the presence of a
null Killing vector presents an obstruction to the existence of such
solutions.  This leads us to a no-go theorem proved in section 5.  In
section 6, we consider turning on additional sources (while maintaining
a null Killing vector), but show that such examples are unable to
overcome the no-go theorem.  Finally, we conclude in section 7 by
demonstrating (at least perturbatively) how a horizon may be obtained
by relaxing the null Killing vector condition.



Asymptotic time and event horizons in plane waves 


Since our main endeavor is dedicated to finding supergravity solutions
that share the same asymptotics as the maximally supersymmetric IIB plane
wave and that have a regular event horizon, we devote this section to
examining the criteria for the existence of an event horizon. We also discuss 
how  different asymptotics might change the analysis of
the event horizon. First, a cautionary word about event horizons in
asymptotically non flat spaces is in order. A rigorous definition
of event horizons in the case of asymptotically flat black holes is
given, for example, in (pp.  299-300). Namely, a black
hole  is defined as a region of a strongly asymptotically predictable
spacetime  given by . This definition
is equivalent under very mild topological conditions to 
, where  denotes the causal past
of the future null infinity.  However, such a
definition is lacking for general asymptotics, in part because of the
difficulties in identifying . (Discussions of the causal
structure in spaces asymptoting to plane wave have appeared in
.) The need for finding criteria
for an event
horizon without requiring knowledge of the global development of a
spacetime was addressed partially in (pp.  308-312). Along those lines we will, as a working definition,
declare a black hole to be a region causally disconnected from asymptotic
infinity.

Our analysis, however, uses asymptotic infinity rather indirectly by
replacing it by a suitable causally connected region . Thus, we only need
to show that this region , which is causally connected to asymptotic
infinity, is causally disconnected from the black hole region. Therefore,
our analysis
boils down to the study of the proper (affine)  time and the time of
propagation of signals along timelike and null geodesics. Namely, we
require the proper (affine) time  to be finite so that the spacetime
can be extended beyond that point but we require the (coordinate) time
traveled along a timelike or null geodesic to be infinite so that causal
communication is impossible.  Note that, by coordinate time, we mean a
suitable time coordinate conjugate to a timelike Killing vector.  Up to
finite time dilation, this would be the time measured by a static
observer in the region .

Of course, it may be the case that there is not a unique timelike
Killing vector.  In this case, different choices may be made for
coordinate time, corresponding to different observers boosted with
regard to each other.  For finite boosts, all such observers are in
causal contact.  Thus if any single observer (i.e.  choice of time
coordinate) can communicate with the purported black hole region, then
a horizon cannot exist and the "black hole" would instead be a
singularity of some sort (assuming a curvature singularity develops).
As a result, our procedure is clear.  To demonstrate the existence of a
horizon, we must show that all possible choices of coordinate time yield
an infinite  along the geodesic.  In practice, however, it is
often sufficient to consider only a handful of choices, as will be made
clear below.

For the geometries we are interested in, it is sufficient to discuss only
metrics which admit a null Killing vector.  Let us begin by considering a
generalization of the plane wave metric of the form:

ds^2=e^2A(r) [-4 dx^+ dx^- +H dx^+2 ] + e^2B(r)  dr^2 + ,

where ellipses signify other coordinates which are unimportant for the
present purpose. In addition, let us assume that there is an event horizon
at some finite distance .  Then one can study geodesics crossing the
horizon and estimate the affine time and the time as measured by an
observer in causal contact with infinity.
To investigate the conditions under which an event horizon might exist,
we consider timelike and null radial geodesics in this geometry. The geodesic
equations can be obtained from the following effective Lagrangian:

L  = e^2A(r) [-4x ^+ x ^- + H x ^+2 ] + e^2B(r) 
r ^2,

where dots indicate differentiation with respect to the proper time.
Since the above Lagrangian does not depend explicitly on  and
, we have two integrals of motion,  and , which allow to
solve for the motion along  and  as

x ^+=e^-2A  E_-, x ^-=12 e^-2A (E_-E_+).

We set   for timelike and null geodesics respectively
and solve for motion along the radial coordinate

r ^2 =e^-2B [e^-2A E_-(E_-2E_+)+].

By integrating this equation we find the proper time needed to travel
between two radial positions  and  along an
incoming geodesic

=_r_fin  ^r_in  dr
e^B [e^-2A E_-(E_-2E_+)+]^-1/2 .

Similarly we have the following formal variations of  and :

 


To identify an asymptotic time coordinate for the metric (),
we note that it admits two Killing vectors,  and
.  Thus we may choose to measure time as

 

(with constant  and ), so long as  is a timelike
interval.  This results in the condition .  So long
as we are interested in solutions that asymptote to the maximally
supersymmetric IIB plane wave, then

r    -116 ^2 r^2,

so that  by itself is a timelike Killing vector.
In this case  can be taken as a natural asymptotic time coordinate,
and we may set  in ().  However, for
 either null or spacelike, we cannot set ,
and hence must resort to  (or some combination of  and )
as an asymptotic time coordinate.  We will make a distinction between
these two possibilities below.

Since we are interested in motion near the purported horizon at ,
a generic behavior for the warp factors can be modeled by 

e^2A (r-r_0)^2a ,e^2B (r-r_0)^2b .

The behavior of the function  can be a little more involved. Let us
assume a power-like behavior:

(r-r_0)^2h  sgn .

For () and () to make sense we need the square
root to be real. We first consider the case  at the
horizon, i.e.  . Taking  we find

_0^dx x^a+b , 
x^+ _0^dx x^b-a ,
x^- _0^dx x^b-a .

In this case, regardless of the choice of time coordinate,
(),
this means that to have a horizon we need  and . On
the other hand, if  grows , we need 
(otherwise we would encounter a repulsive singularity much like in the
negative mass Schwarzschild black hole). In this case  

_0^dx x^a+b+h ,
x^+ _0^dxx^b-a+h ,x^- _0^dxx^b-a-h .

Here care must be taken in relating asymptotic time to  and .
Note that  is always strictly more divergent than 
 since .  Hence the shortest attainable  is given
by using  as asymptotic time, which is only possible for
 timelike.  Since all other observers would
measure a longer time interval, we only need to check that 
diverges.  As a result, the horizon conditions are  and
.  On the other hand, if  were
null or spacelike,  would always include a non-vanishing
contribution from .  In this case, the second horizon
condition is modified to , which is a weaker condition
than that for  timelike.  Finally, let us note
that for a logarithmic behavior, ,
the situation is effectively identical to the  case. The only
novelty is that   leads to a repulsive, negative mass
type of behavior. 

To summarize, for solutions that asymptote to the maximally
supersymmetric IIB plane wave, in which case  is
timelike, the conditions for the existence of a horizon are

&a+b>-1,a-b1&if   
h0;

&a+b+h>-1,a-b1+h&if    h<0
  and   sgn &a+b>-1,a-b1&if   
(r-r_0),

where  and  have been defined in () and
(), respectively.  Note that the second line is stronger
than the first line.  Hence if no horizon is possible for ,
neither can it be possible for .  

More generally, one can state that the criteria ()
apply for any background whose asymptotics are those of a homogeneous
plane wave, i.e.  
.
Since  is positive by the weak energy condition, and 
is the sum of the eigenvalues of , this implies that
 is asymptotically a time-like Killing vector;
therefore all results previously derived are valid.  On the other hand,
for the case where  is null or spacelike, our
above analysis still holds, provided the second condition in ()
is replaced by

 

This condition is now weaker than for the  case.

The set of conditions for the existence of a horizon defined as the boundary 
of a region causally disconnected from infinity, (), can be equally
well derived from a local analysis of the horizon. In the latter case we define
the horizon as the boundary of a region of no escape; the idea behind this 
local definition is that gravity bends light, and  
a massive enough object could ultimately trap the light wavefronts.
If this were to happen, then the outgoing light wave fronts would have a decreasing
area, finally reaching the horizon whereupon the light rays would be instantaneously 
parallel. Since the rate of change in the area is given by the 
scalar expansion , we turn to a 
computation of the expansions associated with the two null vectors 
pointing in the directions of the incoming and outgoing light wavefronts.
For instance, the expansion associated with the the vector tangent to 
the null geodesic  is 
 where the hat denotes the implicit projection
onto the  vector space orthogonal to the null vectors. The
other null vector is normalized by , and since it 
corresponds to the outgoing light wavefront it has a non-vanishing radial 
component. 
The trapping horizon is the closure of a  
hypersurface foliated by marginal surfaces, on which  vanishes
and  is non-vanishing and negative (see for example
). 
Therefore in the trapped region
we have . Without going into further detail, one 
obtains the weaker of the two conditions in ()
from the requirement that the second expansion is non-zero and negative
at the horizon, while the strongest
condition (the fact that infinity and the interior of the horizon are causally
disconnected) is equivalent with the fact that the first expansion (the
 one) vanishes.


 



Other asymptotic times 

For spacetimes asymptotic to the plane wave, we have been able to
identify the asymptotic time with . This is, however, not the case
for various examples of known solutions which have a null Killing vector
and a regular horizon. To clarify this point and to warn the reader that
the horizon criteria must be applied with care, we will present two
examples where () is not directly applicable. 

The first example is the five dimensional three charge black hole solution.
When lifted to ten dimensions it is mapped into a D1-D5 system
(in the string frame)

ds^2 = (H_1 H_5)^-1/2  (-dx^+ dx^- + K dx^+  ^2)+(H_1 H_5)^1/2 
dx ^2 _4  + H_1^1/2 H_5^-1/2  dy ^2 _4 ,

where the three charges of the 5d black hole correspond to the number of
D1 branes, , the number of D5 branes, , and the momentum along
the compactified 9-th direction, :

H_1(r)=1+c_1Q_1 r^2 ,H_5(r)=1+c_5Q_5 r^2 ,K(r)=c_wN r^2 ,
and where .

Given that this solution asymptotes to Minkowski flat space, we may
choose

t=x^+ +x^- 2,x_9=x^- -x^+ 2,

(or a similar but boosted frame).  The clock of the observer at infinity
measures time in the coordinate  rather than , as would be
natural for the case of solutions asymptoting to BFHP.  Using the two
integrals of motion

E=(H_1 H_5)^-1/2  ((1-K)t+Kx_9),E_9=(H_1 H_5)^-1/2 ((1+K)x_9-Kt),

the radial timelike geodesic, in the vicinity of , is given by

-1=1r^2 [ -(1+K)E^2+(1-K)E_9^2+2KE E_9]+r^2 r^2 .

Hence the proper time spent nearby the horizon is finite:

drdr,

while, from the point of view of the observer at infinity, the time elapsed
is infinite

dtdr r .

These results are a particular case of (), where we must
consider that near  it is  which provides the leading
behavior of .


The area of the horizon is finite, and the entropy is solely determined
by the product of the three charges, .
Note that for this solution
the norm of the Killing vector  is vanishing 
on the ergosphere,
, and is 
positive for . A similar situation
was encountered for  the four dimensional charged Kerr black hole. This
means only that to pass through the stationary surface at 
following a timelike radial geodesic, one needs motion in the 
direction as well; i.e.  setting  would be inconsistent.

The second example that we want to discuss is the 5d black string
obtained in (see also).
This five dimensional solution, whose metric in the string frame is given by

ds^2= fh dx^+2 +2h dx^+ dx^- + kl(dr^2+ r^2 d_3^2),

is characterized by four charges

f(r)&=&1+Q_1 r,h(r)=1+Q_2 r,

k(r)&=&1+P_1 r,l(r)=1+P_2 r.

The asymptotic metric is Minkowski, and the asymptotic time is naturally
identified as

t=x^-,x_5=x^+ + x^-

(again up to a boost).
The event horizon is located at , as we can convince ourselves by
estimating the proper time elapsed as the free falling particle approaches
the horizon

-1=-E_-^2 r^2 +2 E_- E_+ r +r^2 r^2 ,

where  are integrals of motion associated with the
 isometries.  Thus the
proper time is finite, , while the observer
at infinity measures an infinite time, .
As before, there is a stationary surface where  vanishes, and
to reach the horizon at  the free falling particles must move in
the  direction as well.



Solution generation with a null Killing vector 


Having examined the criteria for the existence of a regular event
horizon in a generalized plane wave metric, we now turn to some
examples.  Since  a covariantly constant
null Killing vector precludes the existence of a regular horizon, here
we relax the covariant constancy but maintain a null Killing vector.  In
this case, we may apply the observation of Garfinkle and Vachaspati
 (see also) that such a metric with a null
Killing direction gives rise to a separation property of the Ricci
tensor, ().  As indicated below, this property may be
exploited to construct new wave solutions, given an initial "seed"
solution.

The Ricci tensor in the presence of a null Killing vector 

While the separation property of is more
general than the one considered here, for the applications considered in
this paper, it is sufficient to take a generic metric of the form

 

where ,  and  are in
general functions of all transverse coordinates .  Note that
this form of the metric allows us to subsequently split the 
directions into additional longitudinal, relative-transverse and
overall-transverse directions by taking the functions to be independent
of some of the 's.

For this metric, the non-vanishing Christoffel symbols are

 

In this expression and below, indices are not summed over unless
explicitly indicated.  A straightforward computation yields for the
non-trivial components of the Ricci tensor

 

where .  Note, in particular, that 
 only appears in .  As a result, this allows us to write

 

where  is computed from () when .
Note that, up to a suitable coordinate transformation,  is
simply the Ricci tensor for the "conventional" metric

 

A particular case of () that we will often be
interested in are metrics with a split transverse
space, of the form

 

The Ricci components for this metric may be obtained from
() by taking  for  and  for
 and furthermore by demanding that ,  and 
are independent of .  The resulting Ricci components are

 

where  and 
 and
.  While
 is the flat transverse Laplacian, we note that the covariant
Laplacian

 

is in fact the natural quantity that shows up in ().  This
is also the combination appearing in (). The appearance of
the transverse Laplacian is the foundation of the Garfinkle-Vachaspati
method, which is based on finding solutions to 
. In this sense, the present solution generating
mechanism is based on finding solutions to the transverse Laplacian, but
with a source on the right hand side.


Solution generating technique 

In this subsection we show explicitly how the previous separation of
 can
be used as a solution generating technique. We briefly review some known
solutions in the literature under this light, but also present new
solutions. Hopefully our presentation here will provide a unifying
framework for understanding a wide class of solutions that asymptote
to the BFHP solution.

The general construction states that given a supergravity solution of
 we can generate a solution  where the metric in 
asymptotes to the BFHP solution. Let us consider the Einstein equations
of motion for the seed solution 
R_MN ^(0) =T_MN ^(0) .
This solution corresponds to . Due to the properties of the Ricci
tensor we see that it is possible to
construct a solution with  granted we can provide a 
 that compensates the contribution of  to the Ricci
tensor. In particular we see that all we need to provide is a new field
whose only contribution to the stress energy tensor is of the form
. The candidate for such field is a null form, naturally
. Note, however that this construction is not universal and one has
to guarantee that the introduction of the null 5-form be compatible
with the existing form fields in the seed solution. This nonuniversality
forces us to consider generating solutions on a case by case basis.



The BFHP solution 

The simplest example of an -deformed solution is the BFHP
background itself, which can be seen as the -deformation
of ten dimensional Minkowski spacetime.
The maximally supersymmetric plane wave solution to IIB theory was constructed
in as a supergravity background involving the metric
and RR 5-form flux.  In Brinkman coordinates, the solution has the form

 

Having ten dimensional Minkowski spacetime as the seed solution, its
non-deformed equations of motion are trivial. For the deformed solution
there is only one nontrivial equation:

H =-^2.

Here it is seen that the 5-form
serves as a source to this equation (the  alluded to
previously), resulting in a general 
symmetric solution
 

Setting  results in the maximally supersymmetric plane wave
solution.


Many important features of this solution derive from the fact that the
plane wave metric admits a covariantly constant null Killing vector,
.  In particular, the only non-trivial Riemann
and Ricci components are

 

It is easy to show that any generalization of the plane wave metric
which preserve a covariantly constant null Killing vector does not
admit an event horizon.  The details of the argument were spelled out in
.


-deformed 3-branes 


We now turn to a generalization of D3 branes in a plane wave background.
These types of backgrounds have been described from the supergravity point
of view in, for example, and from the string theoretic
point of view in. Here we view these
solutions as -deformations of the standard D3-brane solution of IIB
supergravity.

There is however an ambiguity in the form of the new 5-form needed to
compensate for the introduction of nonzero .  We begin by presenting
the D3  solution.  The supergravity background in question is

 

where  corresponds to the D3-brane source (giving rise to
) and  is
the compensating null 5-form supporting the  deformation.
We find that, as explained previously, all equations are satisfied by
virtue of the seed solution with

H=1+L^4r^4 ,

where the six dimensional radius is .
We are left with only one equation involving  and the new source:

[^(6)  +H(_x^2+ _y^2)]
with general solution of the form

H =c_0 + Q r^4 
-116 ^2 (^2 + L^4r^2 ),

where .
For  we recover the solution presented in. 

Let us analyze the possibility of a horizon for this solution from the
point of view of section . Exploring the possibility of a
horizon at , we find  and . However, the behavior of 
(and hence the horizon analysis) depends on the charges present in the
solution.  For the standard D3 brane  we find a
horizon as expected.  On the other hand, allowing  leads
to .  In this case, according to the criteria ()
 is no longer a horizon.  Finally, for  but nonzero
, we find that the dominant term in , using the language of
section , corresponds to  and  which
signals a repulsive singularity. Thus the -deformation of D3 branes
resulting in a generalization of the form D3  does not admit
a regular horizon.


Another possibility of consistently introducing a null 5-form supporting
nonzero   leads to a generalization of the D3  solution.
In this case, however, in order for the null 5-form to be compatible
with the initial , the seed D3 brane must be delocalized
along two of its transverse directions.  The supergravity background is
then of the form

 

where again  corresponds to the D3-brane source, while
 is now turned on corresponding to the  solution.
The D3 brane is delocalized along the  and  directions.  As a
result, instead of (), the seed solution has

H=1+L^2r^2 ,

where .  The equation for  is

[^(4)  +H(_x^2+ _y^2)+_w^2+_z^2]=-^2H,

which has a solution

H =c_0 + Q r^2 
-116 ^2 (^2 + 6L^2r),

where .  This generalizes the solution of
. In the notation of section  we find that
. For  we have a horizon at . However, for the general
expression for  () we find  and subsequently the
conditions for the existence of a horizon () are not
satisfied. In the particular case of  the main
contribution comes from the logarithmic term in  which results in a
regular horizon. 
Thus, for this type of solution we are able to successfully use
the solution generating mechanism to obtain a solution which
asymptotically approaches the BFHP solution and contains the same
horizon as the seed solution. 



Intersecting branes 


As the above examples indicate, the -deformation can be 
easily applied to many  brane solutions.  For another example, we
consider the intersecting D1-D5 system.  The IIB
fields of interest are the metric, dilaton, RR 3-form and RR 5-form
field strengths.  In the Einstein frame, the appropriate equations of
motion are

 

As demonstrated in, this system admits independently both
D1  and D5  solutions in the plane wave
background. These two solutions can be combined to form a generalization
of the D1-D5 solution having the
form

 

Note that, for simplicity of notation, the  split of the plane wave
is in the  and  directions, as
indicated explicitly for the 5-form.  Here,  are
overall-transverse coordinates, while  are
relative-transverse coordinates.  The D1 and D5 Harmonic functions
satisfy  and .  For radial symmetry, they
may be written as

 

where  is the overall-transverse radius
(As expected, by setting  to zero and conformally rescaling
the Einstein frame metric () with a dilaton factor 
, one reobtains the standard D1-D5 metric in the string frame, 
in flat space ().) .

For the plane wave background,  satisfies the Laplace equation
with source

 

To obtain the proper plane wave asymptotics, we take
, where 
contains all eight transverse coordinates.  The appropriate solution to
() has the form

 

where the constant  may be absorbed by shifts in .
For , this is identical to the well-known 3-charge  black
hole, lifted to ten dimensions (compare with (), which is
instead given in the string frame), with entropy 
.

Let us investigate what happens to the original  horizon of the
seed solution. Here we have  and ; this means that the
second set of conditions in () for the existence
of a horizon is satisfied, and we have succeeded in deforming the solution
in a way that preserves the horizon of the seed solution and changes the
large  asymptotics to that of the BFHP solution. 
Moreover, the horizon is non-singular, just as for the D1-D5 system in flat
space.


Non-extremal deformations 

The examples of the previous section indicate that many brane solutions
initially asymptotic to Minkowski space may be given BFHP plane wave
asymptotics by appropriately turning on a 
null 5-form.  However, in all such examples, we have focused on
extremal brane configurations.  In this section, we turn to the possibility
of constructing non-extremal deformations of the maximally symmetric
BFHP solution without the introduction of additional fields.  Our
starting point is thus the metric and RR 5-form, initially of the form
().

While the metric itself has an  isometry, the true isometry group
is only  because of the 5-form.  This suggests that, when
seeking non-extremal generalizations, one should be content with
preserving only  invariance of the metric.
Nevertheless, we proceed first with an ansatz that retains 
invariance of the metric, and subsequently turn to the 
 case.

An  invariant deformation 

For an  invariant deformation, we take as generalization of
() a metric of the form

 

with the 5-form unchanged.  In addition to the original ,
this introduces two additional 'blackening' functions  and
.
Since the 5-form equations of motion are trivially satisfied, we only
need to be concerned with the Einstein equation.  However, in this case,
a non-constant function  eliminates covariant constancy of
, since
.
Once we have relaxed the covariant constancy of ,
additional non-trivial components of the Ricci tensor show up, and there
are more components of the Einstein equation to be solved.
Nevertheless, as demonstrated in the previous section, the 'harmonic
function'  only arises in the  component.  Thus the
system essentially separates into a set of source-free equations,
 and , as well as an equation for  arising
from .  The former equations may be solved independently of the
structure of the 5-form source.  Thus we may essentially first build up
a vacuum solution and then demonstrate that  may be consistently
turned on in such a background.

The Ricci components ,  and  may be read off
from () for  and .  Specializing to 
symmetry, we take  and  to be  functions of  only.
The resulting vacuum Einstein equations read

 

The first two equations are readily solved.  In particular, by defining
, we obtain the equation
, with solution

 

where we have fixed the asymptotics by demanding  as
.  Substituting this into the first equation of
(), we find  which admits
a solution  where  is a constant and

 

Finally, the last equation of () provides a constraint,
.

Putting everything together, this yields a metric of the form

 

Until now, we have been able to completely ignore the harmonic function
.  This shows up only in the  equation, which for
() simply reads ,
where  is given by (), or

 

Just as in the equation for , this is simply the transverse
Laplacian, however this time with a 5-form source.  The solution is
given by

 

which is the generalization of ().  Even though one can
solve explicitly for , we are mainly interested in its leading
behavior near :

 

A particular case of this solution appeared in, where the
 case was considered (i.e.  in the absence of 5-form flux).

The function  in Eq. () is reminiscent of a blackening
function in isotropic coordinates, and the metric () has
a potential horizon at .  However, for the vacuum solution, it
was shown in that  is in fact a naked curvature
singularity, and not a true horizon.  The addition of the 5-form flux,
while yielding the proper plane wave asymptotics at infinity,
, does not change this conclusion.
This may be seen from the analysis of section  and in particular
(), where  and
, so that the  condition
is violated.  Thus we must look elsewhere for a solution with a realized
horizon.

Note that this IIB background may be T-dualized and lifted to provide a
solution to eleven dimensional supergravity in terms of a non-extremal
deformed M2-brane, which generalizes the extremal solution of
.  The result of the lifting is

 

which indicates that  has the form of a M2-brane harmonic function.
It may be shown that this eleven-dimensional solution also has a naked
singularity at .


An  deformation 

Having explicitly demonstrated that the  symmetric solution leads
to a naked singularity, we now consider the possibility of introducing
a regular horizon by deforming () in an 
symmetric manner.  This situation is very similar to that of the large
black hole in .  We therefore proceed with a metric
ansatz

 

where ,  and , .
Based on the large black hole idea, we take the functions ,
 and  to be functions of  only, while
we allow the harmonic function  to depend on all
eight transverse coordinates.  The 5-form must be chosen to respect both
self-duality and the Bianchi identity .  For the above
metric ansatz, the appropriate choice is

 

In fact, the combination of self-duality and Bianchi is quite restrictive,
and indicates that in general we would be unable to allow 
dependence in  or , except in the  invariant case when
.

The non-vanishing components of the Ricci tensor may be obtained from
() with  and .  We again note that 
only appears in , where it enters in terms of an appropriate curved
space transverse Laplacian, and that the remaining Einstein equations
are simply ,  and .  The latter source-free
equations may be solved as in the previous subsection.  Defining

 

we find

 

where the constants  and  are required to satisfy the
condition

 

This is the equation for an ellipse, and admits solutions for real
 and .

Finally, turning to the  equation, we find

 

Unlike in the  invariant case, (), here the source
term is no longer simply constant.  In addition, while  is a function
of both  and , these two transverse
coordinates enter asymmetrically in the above.  However, this equation may
be solved by assuming that  separates as a sum of functions 
of  and  respectively.  Although other solutions are possible,
we simply choose 
 so as to reproduce the asymptotics at infinity.  
Then Eq. () becomes

r^-3 _r(r^3g_rH )=-12^2
f^-2(+3) g^2(2f^-2(+3) -1),

which may be integrated twice to obtain .  The
large distance asymptotics has the form

 

while the behavior near  is either logarithmic for
 or given by a power law, 
, otherwise.

In this manner, we have obtained a  invariant
deformation of the maximally symmetric plane wave of the form

 

This solution is similar to the  invariant example of
(), in that the harmonic function solving ()
almost entirely decouples from the Einstein equations.  This is a
feature of retaining  as a null Killing
direction, and ensures that the blackening functions  and 
essentially have the form as they would for a vacuum solution, even in
the presence of the 5-form flux.

We now investigate whether this solution admits a horizon at .
Since both  and  near , the leading
expansion of the warp factors is

e^2A (r-r_0)^2 ,e^2B (r-r_0)^1-2(+2) .

This yields  and .  For
, so that  is logarithmic near ,
the criteria for a horizon, (), is then

 

The second inequality is incompatible with the ellipse condition,
(), since

^2+2+3^2-(+)^2+2^2-382^2+3 16 >0.

On the other hand, if  diverges as a power law, the existence
of a horizon requires , which is
also incompatible with the ellipse condition, since it amounts to

.  Thus all pairs  on the ellipse
() parametrize solutions that have naked singularities at
.

No horizons for metrics admitting a null Killing vector 

Based on the observations made in the previous section, one may develop
the suspicion that the class of static metrics preserving a null Killing
vector do not allow for a regular horizon.  Here we demonstrate that
this is indeed the case by proving a no-go theorem.  More precisely, we
shall prove that:

 
In the presence of matter contributing only to , and with
 asymptotically a timelike Killing vector,
the following metric 

 

cannot admit a regular  invariant horizon.  

Before proceeding to the proof, let us discuss the conditions of the theorem.
The fact that we consider only null matter puts us in the simplest class of
metrics that asymptote to the BFHP solution with no other fields turned on.
Taking  as an asymptotic time coordinate (corresponding to
 being a timelike Killing vector)
is a natural consequence of
the requirement that the metric asymptotes to the BFHP solution (
). We will comment on the consequences of relaxing
these conditions at the end of this section. 

The proof of the no-go theorem relies on the separation property of
the metric in the presence of a null Killing vector, (). This
separation implies that the vacuum Einstein equations for
() are equivalent to those of a "conventional"
 metric supplemented by an equation on  (resulting
from the  equation).  Thus we begin by considering
a metric, not in light-cone variables, but rather written as

 

The radially-symmetric vacuum Einstein equations are (no sums except
where explicit)

 

where  and  denote directions on .  As before, the
first three equations admit a solution of the form

 

where

 

We stress that this is the most general solution consistent with the
natural 
boundary conditions at infinity.

Making use of the identity

 

we find that the  equation yields the algebraic constraint

 

Note that all parameters  enter symmetrically in the
constraint.  This indicates that singling out the time coordinate in
() has no effect at the level of the solution.  On the
other hand, since we are interested in identifying a potential horizon,
we find it useful to maintain this  split.

Any set of parameters satisfying () provides a solution
to the vacuum Einstein equations.  However, we must further examine
whether the solution admits a regular horizon.  To do so, we consider
timelike radial geodesics in the background ().  Since
the metric is time-independent, we immediately identify a conserved
energy , where dots refer to derivatives with respect to
the proper time, .  Radial geodesics are then parametrized by
solutions of

 

Based on the behavior of  and  given in (), we may
expand  and  near .  For , the first
term dominates, and we find

 

or

 

For  to be a horizon, we demand that the exponent in
() is such that the geodesic cannot reach  in finite
coordinate time .  This gives rise to the condition

 

for the existence of a horizon.

To determine whether solutions to the constraint () are
compatible with the horizon condition, we rewrite () as

 

However, since the first term is bounded below by unity from
(), and since the remaining terms are sums of squares,
we see that the only satisfactory solution has  and all
's set to zero.  In this case, the metric ()
is especially simple, and has the form

 

This is simply an -dimensional Schwarzschild black hole (written
in isotropic coordinates) tensored with additional flat dimensions.

Thus we have shown that metrics of the form () only admit
 invariant horizons of the Schwarzschild form,
().  This is perhaps not very surprising, as it
corresponds to some limited form of a uniqueness theorem for black
holes

(Of course, consideration of black hole uniqueness is
considerably different in dimensions greater than four.  Here we are not
claiming to make a general statement, but rather a statement only in the
context of vacuum solutions of the form ().) .

Before returning to the light-cone metric, (), we note
that black -branes of the general form
 

fall into this category of blackening, and indeed have regular horizons.

Finally, we are in a position to make contact with the generalized
pp-wave metric of ().  As demonstrated in
section , because of the null Killing vector
, the vacuum Einstein equations for
() are identical to that of () with an
additional longitudinal coordinate (say ) satisfying the condition
, supplemented with a transverse Laplace equation on


 

(where the Einstein equation is ).
This has no effect on the blackening functions  and  of
().

Assuming  to be asymptotically timelike, we now
examine the conditions, (), which determine the existence of
an event horizon for the generalized pp-wave metric ().
Since these conditions depend on the form of , we consider several
cases in turn.  First, we assume that  is logarithmic or finite
near the horizon. Then the horizon conditions are simply

+> -1,1,

where , in accord with previous
calculations.  Note that the second inequality is the same condition as
(), which determined the horizon for the metric
(), except that for the metric () we have
.  Recalling that the  Einstein equation imposes a
constraint () which is compatible with the conditions
defining an event horizon only if  for all 's, we see that
we end up with a contradiction.  Next, we consider the case where 
grows near the horizon (); this corresponds to the second case of
().  However, now the second horizon condition is of the
form  (since ), which is even stronger
than (), and hence is never satisfied.  Finally, we note
that if  blows up negative near  (either logarithmically or
as a power) we end up with a repulsive singularity.

As a result, we have demonstrated that all solutions of the form
() with null matter are necessarily naked singularities
(except for the trivial Minkowski vacuum).  The essential feature here
is that, to maintain a null Killing vector, the 'light-cone' directions
 and  must be 'blackened' simultaneously.  This would be similar
to seeking a black string solution of the form

 

which does not admit regular solutions, in contrast to the appropriate
blackening ansatz of the form ().  As a result, to
obtain a reasonable horizon for the vacuum solution, we must relax the
null Killing vector condition (at least near the horizon).

We now comment on how the theorem may be modified if any of the
conditions is relaxed.  Firstly, the introduction of additional non-null
matter would modify the Einstein equations that determine ,  and
 in a way that depends on the concrete type of matter involved.
Thus we are unable to make any general statements without explicitly
specifying the non-null matter content.  As indicated in the next section,
turning on additional matter is not always enough for the evasion of the
no-go theorem.

Secondly, the identification of an asymptotic time coordinate is another
crucial condition.  So long as  in the asymptotic region,
 is asymptotically a timelike Killing vector, and
the above analysis applies.   However, for  null or
spacelike, one must instead resort to the horizon criteria ().
For  the condition is precisely what we had previously,
(), and the no-go theorem can be repeated along the same
lines. On the other hand, for  the horizon condition becomes
.  In particular, it is a weaker condition than
the one used in proving the no-go theorem.  In this sense, provided 
 is not timelike, turning on  improves
the chances of having a regular event horizon.  As indicated by the
examples considered in section , solutions are easily found
that have a regular horizon.

Finally, it is interesting to note that generically the equation for 
contains a generalized Laplacian that allows for a homogeneous part in
the solution of . Namely, there is usually the possibility of adding
a term such that . The solution to this part
contains, in principle,  and  therefore creates room for having an
event horizon whenever the asymptotic time has a linear component along
. 





Turning on additional sources 

Since deformations of the plane wave background with any splitting and
global symmetry  fall into the
category of ansatze dealt with by the precedent no-go theorem, one might
hope that turning on additional fluxes (i.e.  matter) would help
in evading the previous negative outcome.  Perhaps the most natural
starting point is a string-type deformation of the plane wave, i.e.  an object extended in the  directions.  However, based on
the general structure of the Einstein equations, it is also likely that any
D-brane solution would admit a non-extremal deformation.  Thus, after
considering the string-like case, we turn to ansatze which generalize
the extremal D-brane solutions in the maximal supersymmetric plane wave
background of the type IIB supergravity.


Sourcing a string 

The string ansatz which we analyze has a partial smearing in two
transverse directions, with the metric ansatz corresponding to a  split

ds^2=e^2A(r) [-4dx^+dx^-+H dx^+2 ]+e^2B(r) [dr^2+
r^2 d_5  ^2]+e^2C(r) (dy_1^2 +dy_2^2),

and with the NS-NS 2-form and dilaton field given by

H_+-r =F'(r),12 e^- H^2.

The stress tensor components determined by these fields are

T_+- &=&316 e^-2A-2B e^- F'(r)^2,

T_ab &=&132 _ab e^-4A-2B+2C e^- F'(r)^2,

T_ij &=&132 e^-4A e^- F'(r)^2(_ij -4x_ix_j)
+12 _i _j.

So instead of solving for vacuum Einstein equations for all components
with the notable exception of the  component, we now have sources for
each Einstein equation.  However, in taking appropriate linear combinations
of the  and the  components, the sources cancel and we
can solve for

A+C+2B=12G =12 g,A+3C=f,

where  are

g(r)=1-(r_0 r )^8,f(r)=1-(r_0/r)^4 1+(r_0/r)^4 ,

and  is a constant of integration.

To proceed, we note that the NS-NS and dilaton field equations yield

F'&=&-8e^+4A L^4 r^5 g ,

+ g' g +5r)&=&8e^+4A L^8 r^10 g^2 ,

where  is an integration constant related to the NS-NS 3-form
(string) charge.  Finally, the remaining Einstein equations read

&&A"+A'(g' g+5r)=6e^+4A L^8 r^10 g^2 ,

&&A"+C"+2B"-1r(A'+C'+2B')+A'^2+C'^2-2B'^2-2A'B'-2B'C'

&&=-14 +4A L^8 r^10 g^2 .
Combining the first equation of () with the second equation
of () allows us to solve for  in terms of .  We
obtain

 4-A3=f,

where  is an (as yet) undetermined constant.  Now, using
() and (), as well as the identity

 

the second equation of () can be rewritten as an equation
for  only:

[(e^-8A/3 )'] ^2
-^2 (e^-8A/3 )^2 (f' f )^2
=16L^8 r^10  g^2 ,

where

 

and

 

This equation admits a solution

 

where  is an integration constant (chosen so that  as
) and we assume that  is positive.

Putting the above results together, we find the string solution to have
the form

 

Here , defined in (), is identified with the
fundamental string, since  in the limit
.  Note, however, that  is modified from the standard
F1 harmonic function for finite , and develops a singularity:

 

As a result, the behavior of the metric near  is given by

 

In order to investigate the horizon properties of this solution, we need
one extra piece of information, namely the behavior of .
 From the (++) Einstein equation we obtain

 H  + e^-2C   H =
-^2 e^-2A-6B-2C ,

where  is defined in () and
.
Again, writing 
 to guarantee proper asymptotic behavior, the above equation becomes

r^-5 _r(r^5 g _r H )=
14^2(g^32  f^- -g).


In general, solutions to () will develop a logarithmic
singularity at  (so long as , which is always
satisfied for  positive).  Thus, from (), the
criteria for the existence of a regular horizon is

 

where  is given in ().  It is easy to see
that, while the first inequality is always satisfied, the second one is
never satisfied for real  and .  Thus we must conclude
that this solution is ill behaved whenever .  In fact, 
is a naked singularity, as the curvature invariant 
 blows up at .













Deforming the extremal D-branes 


In section , we have examined extremal D3 branes in a plane
wave background.  Here we consider non-extremal deformations of both the D3
 and D3  branes. Even though some of these solutions were
naked singularities one might hope that a nonzero Hawking temperature
horizon cloaks the original singularity as it was the case for the
nonzero temperature generalization of the 
Klebanov-Tseytlin solution. Of course, the separation 
property of the Ricci tensor () into background and plane wave
pieces allows non-extremal deformations of arbitrary D branes as well.
However we are content with presenting the following examples.

The D3  branes 

For the D3  brane, the supergravity background in question is
given in ().  A natural generalization of this solution
is given by

 

This allows for both additional blackening functions in the metric and a
possible charge modification in the 5-form.  The energy momentum tensor
for this configuration, , decomposes as a sum
of two independent components,  where

 

is a standard D3-brane source, while

 

corresponds to the plane wave deformation.  The vanishing of a possible
cross-term between  and  is not a priori 
guaranteed, but is crucial for the existence of the solution.

Since the Ricci tensor of () similarly splits into two
components, the equations of motion separate into: ) the standard
3-brane equations  (for functions , ,
 and ), and ) a Poisson equation for 

 

where  is defined in () and
.  Note that this is
identical to (), which defined  for the F1 string
solution. This is expected, of course, since 
characterizes the plane wave part of the metric, and obeys an equation
sensitive only to the splitting of the transverse directions, in
this case .

 From the standard
3-brane equations, we can easily obtain certain linear combinations
of the warp factors in terms of the blackening functions  and
:
&&A+2B+C=12G =12g,A-C=f,

&&g(r)=1-(r_0r )^8,f(r)=1-(r_0/r)^4 1+(r_0/r)^4 .
Furthermore, the only non-trivial Bianchi identity
(r^5 e^-2A+4B-2C  (e^2D )')'=0,
can be integrated once to yield the D3-brane potential in terms of the
other warp factors.
Finally, just as in the string solution, the remaining Einstein equation
can be written, after a little algebra, as

[(e^-4A )']^2
-^2(e^-4A )^2
(f' f)^2 = 16L^8 r^10 g^2 ,

where

A=A-2f,

and

 

This equation admits a solution of the form

 

where  is an integration constant, chosen so that  as
.  The D3  metric is thus given by

 

As expected, our solution reduces to the extremal case of ()
if we set  (i.e.  ).  Note that, in this
extremal limit,  is simply the D3 harmonic function, while for
finite , we have instead  as .


The horizon analysis then proceeds as in the string case.  By writing
, we obtain

 

which develops at most a logarithmic singularity at .  As a result,
the conditions for a regular horizon are

 

Again, the second inequality is never solved, and this solution
corresponds to a naked singularity. 









The D3  branes 

The D3  branes of () span the directions
, such that their
worldvolume lies partly in only one of the 4+4 dimensional transverse
spaces. They are supported by an additional 5-form flux 
where  is the radius of the 4 dimensional transverse space which does
not include the  directions, and are partially smeared since all
metric components with the exception of  depend only on . The
D3  branes preserve 1/4 of the linearly realized
supersymmetries.  An ansatz which captures these features and
generalizes () is

ds^2&=&e^2A(r) [-4dx^+dx^-+H (r,x,y,w,z) dx^+2 ]

&&+e^2B(r) [dr^2+ r^2 d_3  ^2]
+e^2C(r) (dx^2 +dy^2)+ e^2D(r) (dw^2+ dz^2),

F_5 ^(0) &=&2(1+*)dx^+ dx^- dx dy de^2E(r) ,

F_5 ^(1) &=&dx^+(dxdy dwdz+
e^4B-2C-2D  r^3 drd_3).

As in the D3  case, the Einstein equations separate cleanly
into a set of standard D3-brane equations and an additional Laplace
equation for .

By taking appropriate linear combinations of Einstein equations such that
the source terms cancel, we learn that
A+B+C+D=12G =12g(r),A+D=f(r),A-C=f(r),
where, as we have become accustomed to, the functions  and  have
the same universal expression sensitive
only to the dimensionality and particular splitting of the transverse space
g(r)=1-(r_0 r )^4,f(r)=1-(r_0/r)^2 1+(r_0/r)^2 .
The only non-trivial Bianchi identity yields
(r^3 e^-2A+2B-2C+2D (e^2E )' )'=0.
Integrating this equation once, one can substitute it into the remaining
Einstein equation:

[(e^-4A )']^2-
^2(e^-4A )^2(f' f)^2
=4L^4 r^6g^2 ,

where

 

and

 

The solution is again of the form

 

with  chosen so that  as .  As a result, the
non-extremal D3  metric has the form

 

and reduces to the extremal case () with ,
when .  
The plane wave function  can be solved from the (++) Einstein
equation

 H +e^-2C  _x,y  H 
+e^-2D  _w,z  H =- ^2 e^-2A-4C-4D .

The resulting behavior at  is generically logarithmic, unless
, whereupon  would instead be
dominated by a power law singularity, 
.

Extracting the behavior of the warp factors near , we find the
horizon conditions

 

(provided  is at most logarithmic at ).  These conditions,
in conjunction with (), do not admit real solutions for
 and .  Note, furthermore, that the case where 
 develops a power law behavior imposes even stronger inequalities,
and the solution is again singular.



The D1-D5 system 

Finally, we note that the D1-D5 system examined in section
 also admits a non-extremal generalization.  The
techniques for obtaining such a solution are similar to that for the
cases considered above.  As a result, we will be brief, and will only
highlight the salient features of the solution.

The equations of motion
governing the D1-D5 system were previously given in (),
and admitted the extremal solution ().  This solution
may be generalized by introducing additional blackening functions in the
metric

 

where

 

with .
The constants ,  and  are then chosen to satisfy
, so that  defined after
() takes on the canonical form .

As is well known, the D1 and D5 charges may become renormalized in the
non-extremal case.  Thus, we can no longer assume the RR 3-form to
be given in terms of the same  and  functions that appear in
the metric.  We find the proper generalization of  given
in () to be

 

where  is a constant to be determined.  This ansatz along with
the  equation of motion then determines the dilaton to be

 

The remaining equations to be solved are the Einstein and dilaton
equations of motion.

Solving the remaining equations yields the explicit form of  and
:

 

as well as the constraints ,  and

 

The constants  and  are chosen so that  as
.  In this case, the "harmonic functions" have asymptotic
behavior

 

indicating explicitly the effect of charge renormalization.  On the
other hand, near , the functions behave as

 


Collecting the above results, we find the non-extremal generalization of
the D1-D5 solution solution to be

 

where  and  are given by (), and  satisfies

 

which limits to () when .  Again, proper
asymptotics may be obtained by setting 
 where

 


Turning to the issue of horizons, we find that

 

in the language of section .  Thus the conditions for the
existence of a horizon are

 

The second inequality is incompatible with the ellipsoidal constraint
().  Hence the solution is a naked singularity.  Note
that in () we have implicitly assumed that  develops
at most a logarithmic singularity.  Since no horizon is possible in this
case, neither can it be possible for the case where  has a power law
behavior.  Thus, once more, in attempting to non-extremalize well
behaved solutions, we instead end up with a naked singularity at .  

While these string, D3 and D1-D5 examples have not been exhaustive, they
nevertheless suggest that the essence of the no-go theorem proven in the
previous section continues to apply, even in the presence of additional
matter sources.  The common feature in all these cases is of course the
null Killing vector, whose preservation requires a simultaneous blackening
of two longitudinal directions.  This results in an 'overblackened'
solution, which is necessarily a naked singularity.  Thus it is likely
that one must give up the null Killing vector in order to avoid the
appearance of such singularities.  This will be examined in the
following section.




Relaxing the null Killing vector condition 

Until now, we have focused on metrics admitting a null Killing vector
as the simplest generalization allowing a horizon and capturing some of
the features of the BFHP solution. However, as we have seen, both the
no-go theorem of
section  (in the absence of sources) and the examples of
section  (with additional sources turned on) suggest that the
null Killing vector condition may still be too restrictive, at least for
obtaining a non-extremal solution with regular horizon.  This difficulty
arises in a way since the null Killing vector, being ,
is not obviously related to the null direction in  that would exist
at the horizon of e.g.  a Schwarzschild black hole.  As a result,
this incompatibility of symmetries apparently prevents the existence of
a regular horizon. To proceed, it is clear that we must relax the null
Killing vector condition.  However, to maintain some relation to the BFHP
solution, we must ensure that proper boundary conditions are satisfied so
that the geometry may at least asymptotically be regarded as the BFHP
solution. 

Let us further consider the general structure of the solution we are
seeking. The general solution would naturally contain two scales: ,
giving the asymptotic strength of the RR 5-form, and , essentially
the Schwarzschild radius or non-extremality scale.  Finding an explicit
solution for arbitrary values of  and  has proven to be a
difficult task.  However, we may consider various limiting cases where
we have a rough intuition of what the solution should look like. For
example, in the limiting case , the two main scales are
widely separated.  This limit is essentially that of a small black hole
in the plane wave background

(The situation is similar to the small black hole in
AdS. Although the existence of this small black hole is conceptually
clear, finding an explicit solution has not been possible so far
. The main obstruction is the same symmetry
considerations we face here.) .


With this separation of scales, if we focus on the region ,
the details of the black hole ought to be irrelevant, and the metric
should end up being asymptotic to the plane wave ().  On the
other hand, in the region where , the black hole geometry
dominates, and the 5-form flux supporting the background may be considered
as a perturbation to the Schwarzschild black hole.  This is precisely
the limit we consider here. We thus will examine the consistency of
this solution by exploring the possibility of perturbatively turning on
a 5-form in a Schwarzschild-like metric.  Namely, we begin by considering
a black string in IIB theory which is the natural starting point (due
to the symmetries) for the plane wave.

We find it convenient to work in isotropic coordinates.  The black
string in ten dimensions may be written as

) 

where

 

Here,  is an eight-dimensional transverse coordinate.  By
defining  and , the black string metric may be
written in the equivalent form

 

In the limit  we see that  and therefore .
Hence , which is a Killing vector, becomes
asymptotically null.  This allows us to make connection with the
plane wave at infinity.

We now seek to turn on a RR 5-form in the background
().  We first note that no solution is possible that
maintains the accidental  symmetry .  This is easily seen by
writing the most general 5-form ansatz compatible with both this
symmetry and self-duality as

 

where  and  are arbitrary functions of .  The Bianchi
identity  then demands that , ,  and
 are all constant.  For  (), this allows the solution
().  However, for , this is only compatible with the
complete vanishing of .  We have thus demonstrated that the
non-extremal solution cannot maintain the accidental  invariance
of the metric.  This should not come as a surprise, because once we
abandon the null Killing vector , we essentially
return to the Freund-Rubin case, where the 5-form is responsible for the
negative and positive curvatures of AdS.

Of course, the  symmetry of () was never a true
symmetry in the first place.  So there is no difficulty in giving it up.
However, we expect to still retain the  symmetry.  To
do so, we write the transverse metric as

 

The most general 5-form allowed by symmetry and self-duality is now
considerably more complicated.  Following, we
determine

 

where ,  are in principle functions of both  and
.  After suitable manipulation, the Bianchi identities read

 

Note that this splits into two pairs of equations, one for  and
another identical set for .

In the extremal case (), the Bianchi identities (which are the
5-form equations of motion) have a trivial solution ,
.  This yields precisely the 5-form of ().  More
generally, we wish to retain this asymptotic behavior,  as
, but otherwise solve () for  of the form
().  Concentrating on , the first two lines of
() may be differentiated further to obtain the second order
equations

 

These are simply the second order equations of motion for the
5-form.  In general, solutions do exist compatible with the asymptotic
condition  as .  However, for simplicity, we now
assume that  are independent of .  In this case, we only
need to solve

 

Then  may be obtained from the first equation of (),
namely .

Since () is a linear second order equation, it admits two
solutions.  It is easy to see that as  the solutions have
behavior  and .  The former yields the proper
asymptotics, while the latter falls off faster than the blackening
function and is subdominant.  On the other hand, the horizon behavior of
 is governed by the limit  and may be obtained by expanding
() for .  Near the horizon, we find either
 or , so that one solution remains
finite, while the second blows up.  Keeping only the solution that
remains finite at the horizon, this gives a unique -independent
solution for the 's, up to overall normalization.  The numerical
solution to () which satisfies such boundary conditions is
shown in Fig. .  As a result, this demonstrates that the 5-form
with the desired asymptotics for connecting to the plane wave of
() may be consistently turned on in the black string 
background.

.  Note that  vanishes at the horizon. 





Although we do not compute the back-reaction from turning on the 5-form,
it is nevertheless instructive to examine the stress-energy source.  For
the 5-form of (), we find

 

for the longitudinal directions, and

 

for the transverse ones.  Here, for convenience, we have defined
.  The asymptotic behavior is
guaranteed as  as , while all quantities remain
finite at the horizon.  This suggests that the back-reaction is under
control.  Furthermore, we see explicitly that the stress energy source
in the transverse directions will break the  symmetry of the
metric (), once back-reaction is taken into account.
While we have not obtained a complete non-linear solution, this
analysis in the regime  provides strong evidence that an
appropriate non-extremal gravitational background does exist . 

It is worth mentioning that there are other approaches for understanding
the phase diagram of asymptotically BFHP solutions. A natural attempt,
complementary to the one presented in this section, 
would be to consider the motion of a particle in the plane wave background
and the subsequent effects on the geometry of increasing the mass of the
particle

(We thank A. Hashimoto and E. Gimon for discussions of
this possibility.) .

This approach has been recently discussed in. 

The complete understanding of phase transitions (like the Hawking-Page
phase transition) and its gauge theory interpretation along the lines of
 requires knowledge of the solution for arbitrary values of
 and . It seems likely at this point that such a phase diagram
might be more intricate than the corresponding one for asymptotically
AdS spaces, in which case finding its complete structure would require
a mixture of approaches. We believe, however, that our arguments for the
existence of a solution with a well-defined Schwarzschild-type horizon
adds a crucial element to the understanding of the ultimate phase diagram.
