 closed strings have been recently 
divided in hep-th/0211147 to two T-dual families
denoted by  and
.
In  signature both families have one scalar in the spectrum.
The scalar in the -string is known to be a deformation 
of the target space Kahler potential and the dynamics is that
of self-dual gravity.
In this paper we compute the effective action of the scalar
in the -string. The scalar is a deformation of a potential
that determines the metric, torsion and dilaton.
The scalar is free and the 
dynamics is that of a self-dual curvature with torsion.

Introduction 

Closed  strings possess local 
supersymmetry on the string worldsheet.
Critical  strings have a four-dimensional target space.
The supersymmetric structure implies that the target space
has a complex structure. Therefore it must be of signature 
or .
In  signature there are no propagating degrees of freedom
in the  string spectrum.
In  signature there is only one massless scalar  in the
spectrum and
the infinite tower of massive excitations of the string is absent.
The effective action of this scalar has been computed inwhich suggested its interpretation as a deformation of the
target space  Kahler potential. 
It was  argued in that the  strings may
describe a quantum theory of self-dual Einstein gravity in four
dimensions.


In the

closed strings have been divided into two families denoted by
 and .
Consider  strings in a flat background.
In order to construct the  string we need to gauge the  
superconformal algebra (SCA) on the worldsheet. 
More precisely we have two copies of the 
algebra to consider: the left and right sectors. 
The free field
representation of the (left)  SCA
takes the form
 
Here  denote the indices of the target space in a real
basis.
The metric is given by
.
 is a Kahler form related to the complex structure

by , and 
the index  refers to the left sector.(For more details see
next section and.) 
Similarly, 
we have the SCA generators in the right sector with a
complex structure .
The (conventional)  string denoted by -string
in is defined by having
the same complex structure in the left and right sectors
.
On the other hand,  string denoted by
-string in has different complex structures in the left and
right sectors (For an earlier discussion see.) .
In fact the - and -strings define two families
of  strings related by T-duality
.

In  signature both families have one scalar in the spectrum.
The scalar in the -string is, as noted above, a deformation 
of the target space Kahler potential and the dynamics is that
of self-dual gravity.
The aim of this paper is to  compute the exact effective action of the scalar
in the -string. The scalar is a deformation of a potential
that determines the target space metric, torsion and dilaton
.
The dynamics is that of a self-dual curvature with torsion
. 

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we consider the 
worldsheet description  of  strings. 
We present the -model Lagrangian description of 
the -string using
a chiral and a twisted chiral superfields and construct the vertex operators.
In section 3, we compute
the genus zero
three-point and four-point scattering amplitudes of the  strings scalar.
In section 4 we show, based on sections 2 and 3,  
that the 
-string scalar is free and that the 
dynamics is that of a self-dual curvature with torsion.
This has been anticipated in based on 
-model and conformal anomaly analysis.




Worldsheet description  of  strings 

In this section we will discuss in some detail the worldsheet
description of the - and -strings.
We consider the -model Lagrangian and the vertex operators.


Complex Structure and  SCA 

In the following we will review some aspects
of the complex structures on  that are relevant to
the generators of  SCA.
In the real basis , the metric is given by
.
We define a complex structure
 

In the complex basis
 
the metric reads , .
In this basis, the complex structure  is diagonal:
 
The Kahler form  is given in the real
basis
by
 
For later reference, we define the quadratic form in momenta
 
where in the complex basis
 
and .
For the on-shell momenta  with 
,
 obey the identities 
where 
.

We will also need a second complex (and  Kahler) structure,
which in the real basis take the form
 
In the complex basis, the complex structure is given by
 
The Kahler form reads
 
We define also
 
which obeys an equation similar to (), for four on-shell momenta. 

The -string in  is defined by the choice
(More precisely, there is a parameter space of
  -strings corresponding to the choice of the complex
  structures in the  SCA, see. 
  The results that will be presented later remain valid for any
  choice of the complex structure .) 
 
in  (), while 
for the -string 
 
The two  strings are related 
by a T-duality along a spatial direction.






A -Model Lagrangian Description 

Here we will consider the two-dimensional -model 
Lagrangian description of the  strings.
We begin by reviewing 
the  superfield formulation in Euclidean
two-dimensional space-time with the complex coordinates  and .
The complex 
 supercovariant derivatives for the left and right movers 
and 
are defined by
 
where  are the complex fermionic coordinates in the
superspace.

Denote  by
 
with 
.
It is easy to see that
 




A chiral superfield  is defined by
 
and an  anti-chiral superfield  by
 
In components we have 
 
and
 

Since , one can define in two dimensions 
twisted chiral superfields  by
 
and 
an anti-twisted chiral  superfield by
 
In components we have 
 
and
 



T-duality along  exchanges chiral (anti-chiral)
superfields and twisted (anti-twisted) chiral superfields.
In the complex structure language, the left movers complex structure
does not change but the right movers complex structure does
().





















































The  -model action
for the -string in a flat background is 
 
where  are chiral superfields and  
 is the Kahler potential for flat  space
 
In the last equivalence we used the freedom of adding holomorphic
and antiholomorphic terms to the  Kahler potential
without changing the metric 
.

The  -model action
for the -string in a flat background is 
 
where  is a chiral superfield and
 is a twisted chiral superfield.  
 is the  Legendre transform of 
with respect to  
 (see).
Thus, 
 







and 
 
The target space metric, torsion and dilaton are encoded in the
function

 
In flat space the torsion and dilaton vanish and we have
 
and
 
Note that in order to get the dilaton equation (), the
dilaton term should be added to the -model
action .


Vertex Operators 

The vertex operators for the massless scalar in the
- and -strings are given by
 
and 
 
respectively. The ghost part will be treated separately.
The vertex operator in the -picture 
comes from the lowest component of the superfields
and is the same for the - and -strings
 
with .
Note that we use  as the lowest component of the superfield .

In order to obtain the vertex operators of higher superconformal ghost
numbers we need to use the picture-changing operations, that are
implemented by acting on the vertex operators with
the worldsheet supercharges given in ().






Using the OPE's of the free fields of the form
 

it follows that
 
from which
 
Here . 
Also
 
from which
 
Here we define .
Finally, the vertex operator of -picture is
 
from which
 
The right sector vertex operator of the same picture takes the same form
with .

As discussed in, the scalar  of the -string is
a deformation of the Kahler structure ()
as . 
What is the interpretation of the scalar   of the
-string?
A generating function for the scattering amplitudes is
 
where
 
and  is the scalar vertex operator (). 
Thus,  is a  deformation of  in ()
.

In the next section, we will compute the scattering amplitudes of
-string and derive the effective action for .







Scattering Amplitudes 

In this section, we compute the three and four point amplitudes
of  strings on a sphere.



Let us begin with the three point amplitude.
Recall that the total superconformal ghost number of the amplitude
on the sphere
is two.
The amplitude takes the form
 
where  () is the left (right) sector contribution
 
Here  is the  spin  
conformal ghost, and 
come from the bosonization of the two sets of superconformal ghosts
.
To evaluate the ghost part in , we use the formulas
 
By setting, say, , we obtain
 
where
 
and .
For -string,  so that
 
where 
 
as in () and ().
This reproduces the result of.

For -string,
 and
 
where 
 
as in ().

The 
two amplitudes  and 
are related by T-duality
along one of two spatial directions (Under T-duality along a 
time-like direction the amplitudes are equal up to a sign.) .
Consider, for instance,  a T-duality along the  direction, which is
implemented by . Here  is the momentum of
a string in the right sector.
It is easy to see that 
 


The amplitude () is reproduced by an effective action
for the scalar satisfying
the Plebanski equation.



We turn to the amplitude () and ask what
is the effective action for the scalar that reproduces it.
Here we find a somewhat surprising result. 

Consider three on-shell momenta  obeying
.
It is useful to work in the complex basis of section 2, where
the on-shell momenta take the form  with
 and
 are real.
Momentum conservation implies the relation
 
We can recast the amplitude as
 
and hence . This means that the effective action
of the scalar 
of the -string has no three-point interaction.



Let us turn now to the computation of the four-point amplitude.
Consider
 
where  comes from the left sector
 
and a similar expression for the right sector.
To evaluate the amplitude, we need the following formulas that involve
the complex structures
 
where ,
and the integral formula
 
Setting, say, ,
it is straightforward to show that 
 
with 
 
Here .










Using the () 
we find that 
 

Consider now the higher-point amplitudes.
As discussed in, 
these amplitudes, if nonzero, will have infinite
number of poles corresponding to unphysical massive string states, and
therefore should vanish.
Alternatively, 
it has been  argued 
in that for  strings in
a flat background, all the scattering amplitudes vanish except
the sphere three-point amplitude.
This stronger claim implies that the -string scalar is
free to all orders in string perturbation theory.







Effective Action and Geometry 

In this section we discuss the effective action and geometry of the 
 strings. 
As shown in, the effective action of the -string
scalar is given by 
 
This effective action reproduces
the correct three-point and four-point amplitudes of the
string computation.
It has not been verified yet that all the
higher-order amplitudes arising from () vanish.

Recall that  is a deformation of the flat space  Kahler potential.
The field equation for  is the Ricci flatness condition.
Thus, the background is  Kahler and  Ricci-flat, which in four
dimensions is equivalent to the curvature being self-dual.

Consider next 
the -string scalar.
We have seen that all the -point amplitudes
vanish. This implies that -string scalar
is free and the effective action is 
 

We have seen that  is a deformation of the potential
 in (), so that the -model action
is
 
where .
The geometry of the theories described by ()
has been studied in.
Define
 
then by examining the scalar component of the action one finds that
 is the metric of the target space and
 is a two-form field.

One defines a connection with torsion by
 
where .
Conformal invariance requires 
the self-duality condition of the Riemann tensor
with torsion ()  
and
 


The derivation of the result that   is a free scalar
using the worldsheet computations that we performed 
is in agreement
with that predicted this based on the conformal invariance
of the -model.
We note that while
in the -model the result is expected to hold
to all orders in
, here we expect that it 
holds to all orders 
in the string loop expansion.
