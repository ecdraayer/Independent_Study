Abstract 
The  obstruction for
a perturbative  reconstruction of the five-dimensional bulk metric 
starting from the four-dimensional metric at the boundary,
that is, the Dirichlet 
problem, is computed in dimensions  and some comments are made 
on its general structure and, in particular, on its relationship 
with the conformal anomaly, which we compute in dimension .




 
  
  









Introduction 

One of the more interesting problems in the celebrated AdS/CFT correspondence
conjectured by Maldacena () in the language introduced by
 Witten (; cf. also  the reviews,,)
 is the decoding of the hologram  . In the minimal
gravitational
setting this amounts to recover the metric in the bulk space from the
metric at the boundary (which is what mathematicians call a Dirichlet 
problem ).
To be specific, in the framework of the geometric approach to holography  
in its Poincare
 form (that is, when the d-dimensional manifold  is
represented as Penrose's conformal infinity of another manifold 
with one extra holographic dimension),
there is a privileged system of coordinates such that the boundary 
 is located at the value  of the holographic coordinate, namely
ds^2 = g^(B)  _ dx^ d^  = -l^2 d^2 4^2  + 1   h_ij (x,)dx^i dx^j
hs 
(The normalization corresponds to a cosmological constant 
 when 
).
It has been already mentioned that the boundary condition is of the Dirichlet type, i.e.
h_ij (x,= 0) = g_ij (x)
where  is an appropiate metric on .
 In the
 basic mathematical work by Fefferman and Graham (FG) () ,
it is proved that 
there is a formal power
series solution to Einstein's equations with a cosmological constant as above.
This power series gives, in principle, a complete solution to the 
Dirichlet problem, at least in the vicinity of the boundary.
When  there is, however, an obstruction, which in 
four dimensions is the Bach tensor
 and in higher dimensions 
is a new tensor, whose specific form is unknown, which will be called in 
the sequel the FG tensor,  , with conformal weight 
. When this tensor does not vanish, 
there are logarithmic terms which appear in the expansion starting at the
order  
metric 
h_ij  = g_ij  +h^(1) _ij  + + h^(d/2) _ij ^d/2   + 
h ^(d/2) _ij  ^d/2    +Even the term  is not 
completely determined; as shown in, Einstein's
equations only give its trace as well as its covariant
derivative. On the other hand, the coefficient of the logarithmic
term is given in terms of the local anomaly   by (cf.).
haro 
h _ij ^d/2 =-4 dg   g^ij  dx_d
a_d 

i.e., it is the energy momentum tensor of the integrated anomaly.

The object of the present paper is to analyze this problem in detail, using
in particular some codimension two techniques, also due to FG originally. We shall find general 
expressions for the obstructions, recursive relationships between them, and
explicit formulas for the eight dimensional conformal anomaly.

Einstein's equations for  and  


 Einstein's equations (
We use the conventions  and .) 
corresponding to a cosmological constant  
read
R_  = d l^2  g^(B)  _ 
Which reduce in the FG coordinates to:
( 2 h" - 2h'h^-1 h' + tr[h^-1 h']h')_ij  + l^2 R[h]_ij  - (d-2)h'_ij  - tr[h^-1 h']h_ij  =0

(h^-1 )^kl (^[h] _i h'_kl  - ^[h] _l h'_ik   ) =0 

tr[h^-1 h"] - 1 2 tr[h^-1 h'h^-1 h'] =0 
We shall consistently denote by   the (Penrose) boundary 
metric and from now on latin indices will be raised and lowered using this
 metric(We shall denote by 
.) . Equations () and () (the ones
needed for our purposes) can now be expanded in a formal power series of
which we give the first two orders.

 The Dirichlet obstruction in d=4 and d=6 





Equations () and () give  and 
&&h^(1) _ij  = l^2 d-2  (R_ij  - R 2(d-1) g_ij )
 l^2 A_ij 

&&h^(1)  = l^2 R 2(d-1)  = l^2 A

&&h^(2)  = 1 4  h^(1)kl h^(1) _kl  = l^4 4(d-2)^2  
( R^kl R_kl  + 4-3d 4(d-1)^2  R^2 )= l^4 4  A^kl A_kl 
If we now remember the definition of the  Bach tensor (using the conventions in)
B_ij  2^k _[k A_i]j  + A^kl  W_kijl  
(where  is the Weyl tensor), and use it in equation (), we get













(d-4)(4h^(2) _ij  - h^(1) _im  h^(1) _j  ^m ) + l^4 B_ij  =0
conveying the fact that, in , if  the expansion is 
inconsistent. Note that, had we introduced the logarithmic term, equation
() now reads
(d-4)(4h^(2) _ij  - h^(1) _im  h^(1) _j  ^m ) + l^4 B_ij  -8h ^(2) _ij =0
with the additional constraint , and the
power expansion is now consistent up to second order, as FG claim. 

On the other hand, if the Bach tensor vanishes, the only further information 
of  given up to this order is the value of its covariant derivative, 
which can be obtained from equation  ().
It is interesting to point out  that there is a very simple 
relationship
 between the Bach tensor and the four-dimensional anomaly.
The vanishing of the Bach tensor is the equation of motion 
corresponding
to the lagrangian:
weyl 
&&LI_41 64 g W_ W^ 

&&= 1 64 g (R^ R_  - 
2 R^ R_  + 1 3  R^2)
But precisely the anomaly (modulo local counterterms) for conformal invariant matter () is given by a 
combination of the Euler characteristic density,  
plus this conformal invariant lagrangian, . In four dimensions the Euler
characteristic density, is given explicitly by
E_4=1 64 ^abcd R_ab R_cd ^ 
1 64  (R^ R_  - 
4 R^ R_  + R^2)
and is a topological invariant, that is, independent of the metric.
The vanishing of the Bach tensor is then the condition for the integrated 
anomaly to be topological, that is, independent of the metric,
 which according
to the previous equation () is the condition for 
h _ij ^d/2 =0
in which case there is no obstruction for a perturbative solution to the
 Dirichlet problem.
The fact that
Z^(d) _ij h _ij ^d/2 
gives (using ()) the FG tensor as the variational derivative of the conformal 
anomaly with respect to the background metric. 
Although both quantities are unknown in the general case, this is a 
 useful constraint.
As an example, we shall begin with the six dimensional case. As in , 
the obstruction comes out taking the limit  in the 
left hand side of the first equation in (), that is:











obstruction 
H_ij &=& 1 4 (1 2 B_kl A^kl +A^k_l A _m A ^m _k)g_ij  -B^m _(i A_j)m  + 1 8 AB_ij  - 1 4 AA_im A_j ^m  

&&+1 8 _k (-1 2  DB_i j  ^k  _j + 2A_l(i C_j) 
  ^kl  - 3A^k _l DA_i j  ^l + A^kl _l A_ij  )  

&&+1 4  A^kl _i _j A_kl  - 1 4 _l DA_i j  ^l + 1 2 _l A_ik  C^l k  _j 

where  is the Cotton tensor.
Then, according to our previous reasoning,
this obstruction should coincide with the
metric variation of the anomaly.
To apply a first check to this idea, let us recall the expression for the six-dimensional
 holographic anomaly that has been proposed in ():
A  1 2 RR^ij R_ij  - 3 50 R^3 - R^ij R^kl R_ikjl  + 1 5 R^ij  _i _j R -1 2 R^ij  R_ij  + 1 20 R R
which can also be written as:
A  A^ij  ( B_ij  + 2A_ik A_j ^k - 3AA_ij  + A^2 g_ij )
We are interested in the metric variation, that is,
H _ij   g^ij  g  A  
yielding:
H _ij = -1 2 B^kl A_kl g_ij +1 2 AB_ij +3A_k(i B_j) ^k -A_(i ^s A^kl W_j)kls  +2(A^kl A-A^ks A^l_s)W_kijl   

+A^kl  A_kl A_ij  +5AA_ik A_j ^k - 6 A_kl A^k_i A^l_j -(A_kl A^kl A -
A^k_sA^ls A_kl )g_ij +1 4 _k DB_i j  ^k 

+^2(AA_ij -A_i^sA_js ) - _k _l (A^kl A_ij -A^k_(i  A^l_j) ) -1 2 _i _j(A^kl A_kl  +A^2) 

-^k( A_(i ^lC_j)lk  + A_(i ^lC_j)kl  + A^kl C_l(ij) ) +_(i  A^kl C_j)kl  +2_(i (A^kl _k A_j)l )
As a matter of fact, the obstruction given by (), can be manipulated 




in order to prove, after some calculation, that both tensors  and
 are identical.   





 A general codimension-two approach 
In order to work out higher dimensions, it proves useful to put at work the codimension two approach
of ( , reviewed in ).
In this approach, the conformal invariants of the manifold  are obtained from
diffeomorphism invariants of the so-called ambient space ,  with two extra dimensions,
one spacelike and the other timelike (cf. the analysis of
diffeomorphisms that reduce to Weyl transformations on the boundary (PBH) in).
If the ambient space is to have lorentzian signature, then the boundary is neccessarily euclidean.
Then, of the two extra (holographic ) coordinates, one is timelike, and the other, spacelike.
They will be denoted by , respectively.
In the references just cited it is proven that one can choose coordinates in such a way
that the ambient metric reads 
ds^2 =g^(A)  _ dx^ dx^  = t^2 l^2 h_ij (x,)dx^i dx^j +dt^2 +t dt dA power expansion in the variable  can now be performed:
h_ij (x,)=g_ij (x)+_a=1 ^ ^a h^(a)  _ij (x)
( is the boundary metric tensor, and it is assumed that the dimension of this space is even). 






The ambient space has to be Ricci-flat  (this is a necessary 
ingredient of the FG construction, which also guarantees that it is an
admissible string background). This means that
^(A)  R _ij =( 2h" -2h'h^-1 h' +tr[h^-1 h']h')_ij  +l^2 R[h]_ij  -(d-2)h'_ij  -tr[h^-1 h']h_ij  =0 
which is identical to the equation (), as has been proved in detail 
in.
It is remarkable that the Ricci flatness condition in  is indeed
equivalent to Einstein's equations with an appropiate cosmological constant in the associated bulk space, . 

Those equations are written for arbitrary  dimension, but it is clear just by
looking at the equivalent form (), etc., that for  any even dimension   the equations are inconsistent unless the tensor that is not multipled by  vanishes, so that it is natural to call that tensor the obstruction .
  Let us insist that even when the obstruction vanishes
 there is an indetermination in the expansion from 
 on.
We turn our attention now to tensors defined in the ambient space. For
instance, the non vanishing components of the Riemann tensor are

 
If we take the  limit we obtain
 l 
R_i j =-t^2  2l^2  (2h^(2)  _ij -1 2 h^(1)  _ik h^(1)  _j  ^k )

R _ijkl =-t^2 l^2 W_ijkl    

R _ijk =t^2 2  C_ijk  

where  and  are the Weyl and Cotton tensors.

If , we can define  as 
R_i j =-t^2 l^2 2 Z^(4)  _ij  d-4 
and using the equation () for  we establish that 
Z^(4)  _ij &=&1 2l^4 (h^(1)  _kl h^(1)  ^kl g_ij 
   -4h^(1)  _ik h^(1)  _j  ^k 
   +2_k _(i h^(1)  _j)  ^k 
   - ^2 h^(1)  _ij .

&& .  - _i _j h^(1)    
   -(d-4)h^(1)  _ik h^(1)  _j  ^k ) = 
   -1 2 B_ij 
where  is the Bach tensor (in any dimension). Then  is
precisely what we have called obstruction in . 











 The four-dimensional  obstruction has then been obtained afresh 
in a natural geometric way 
 from the ambient Riemann tensor. A natural question is whether this
could be generalized to higher dimensions. 
Let us consider a component of the ambient tensor 
__1  __n  R _ 
 with 
indices fixed: , and take the  limit.
This leads to:
l 
(_ )^n R_i j =-t^2  2  l^2n+2  Z^(4+2n)  _ij  d-(4+2n)  


(_ )^n R _ijkl =
    -t^2  l^2n-2    W ^(4+2n)  _ijkl    


 (_ )^n R _ijk =
     t^2 2  l^2n  C ^(4+2n)  _ijk  


where  and  are generalizations of the Weyl () and
Cotton () tensors.

Performing the same calculation as before for ,  we obtain the
obstructions for higher dimensions (the results are presented in the appendix
).
These tensors yield the Dirichlet obstruction in the corresponding dimension.

From the general expression () 
we obtain the relationship 
recursive 
. (_ )^n+1 R _ij   _=0 
=. _ (_ )^n R _ij   _-. 2_(i ^k  (_ )^n  R _j) k  _(where  is a
Christoffel symbol of the ambient metric) which relates  to ,
 suggesting a  recurrent computation. 
Unfortunately this is not
straightforward because we need to know the general tensor  
not only in the 
 limit, but also for general . Nevertheless, using the fact that
 is traceless, it can be shown inductively from () that  is traceless as well. Moreover, as
_  ^n) R _ =
_  ^n) R _ =0
we see that  the property of  being tracefree is
equivalent to the trace equations for 
given by the equation (). 



The  Bianchi identities 


Let us now study the Bianchi identity in the ambient space 
_[ R _] =0
If we contract, for instance,  and , and remember that the ambient space is
Ricci-flat, it reduces to
_ R ^  _ =_lR _ -_ R _ =0
In the particular case , , , one gets close to the boundary
 (using ())  the identity
B_ij =^k C_kij +A^kl W_kijl 
which is the Bach tensor (i.e. ) in terms of A, C, and W.
We can go further and assume that this is a general feature, that is, the obstruction
could be expressed in terms of the generalization of the Weyl and Cotton tensors. 
Starting from the identity
_ _ R ^  _ij =0
we can perform a calculation along similar lines. The result however 
is more complicated than expected:
l 
Z^(6)  _ij =1 2 [ ^k C ^(6)  _kij  +
  A^kl W ^(6)  _kijl -1 2 A^kl _k C _lij -1 2 A^kl A_k  ^s W_lijs -1 d-4 A_i  ^s B_js . 

. +1 d-4 A B_ij +1 2 C_ilk C^lk  _j +1 2 C_ikl C_j  ^lk -1 2 1 d-4 B^kl W_kijl ]






The  Holographic Anomaly 

As a by-product of this computation, the holographic anomaly in  can be evaluated. This anomaly, 
when integrated, would give rise to  upon metric variation, and has not been previously computed 
to our knowledge. It should correspond to the anomaly of a conformal invariant quantum field theory 
 and, as such, 
expressible in terms of the Euler characteristic  and a basis of conformal invariants, . We are not
aware, however, of any existing explicit construction of such a basis, so that we express our result
in terms of Riemann tensors, their derivatives, and contracions thereof. This yields:

a^(8) &=&1 32                
   1 54 R^i j R_i j R^k l R_k l

   -1 144 ^2 R^i j ^2 R_i j  
It is worth noting that, by construction, this expression depends only on
the coefficients  which in turn are given in terms of  (due to
the recurrence relation stemming from the equations of motion). Then, as has been
already remarked in (), the holographic 
anomaly vanishes in a Ricci-flat background, and this is a
general property of the conformal anomaly at any dimension obtained by the holographic setup.






    















    








    










    














Conclusions 

The higher dimensional ()  Dirichlet obstruction  have been computed 
in several 
 ways,
which we believe are equivalent. 
The use of the so called ambient space , with a codimension two
associated space-time
has proved very fruitful both in computing the obstructions themselves as well as in 
uncovering unexpected relationships between the obstructions in different dimensions.
We have also analyzed the relationship of the generic obstruction to the generic conformal anomaly (for conformally invariant matter), along the lines of,
although here clearly we have only scratched the surface of a deep problem, which deserves further study.
The full expression of the eight dimensional holographic anomaly  has been
derived in terms of geometrical quantities .
It would be most interesting to check () 
the expressions of the holographic anomaly in dimensions six and eight.
This would imply, in particular, to verify that the total coefficient of all independent Riemann contractions 
vanishes, due to the basic property of the holographic anomaly that it is zero for Einstein spaces.

Bach-flat spaces 

An interesting question is the characterization of those spaces for which 
there is no obstruction. In  dimensions, this is equivalent to find Bach-flat spaces.
It is known (cf.) that all conformally
Einstein spaces are in this class, but there are other solutions besides
those (cf.), and a complete characterization is not known to us.
The non-asymptotically flat solutions found by Schmidt are a generalization of
well-known Kasner solutions, with metric
ds^2 = dt^2  - _i=1 ^3a^2_i  dx_i^2
with Hubble parameters , 
and anisotropy parameters 
If we denote
  and , 
 them the vanishing of Bach's tensor is equivalent to:                
3d^2(pr)/dt^2 =  8pr^3 + 4c, c = const.,  p^2 4/3
  ,  

9(dp/dt)^2 r^4 =   [2r d^2 r/dt^2 - (dr/dt)^2 - 4r^4] (4r^2 - 3p^2r^2) 
. 
 Each solution of this
 system of equations with   represents a non asymptotically flat
metric enjoying vanishing Bach tensor.

The Dirichlet obstructions in higher dimensions Following the procedure explained in section , we present in this
appendix the obstructions in higher dimension. We employ the Ricci expansion
coefficients  defined in the previous Appendix. 

For  the six-dimensional () obstruction is given by the tensor
l^6Z^(6)  _ij &=&(2h^(1)  _kl h^(2)  ^kl 
   -h^(1)  ^kl h^(1)  _l  ^m h^(1)  _mk  )g_ij

   +(d-6)(-4h^(2)  _k(i h^(1)  _j)  ^k 
   +h^(1)  ^kl h^(1)  _il h^(1)  _jk )
For  we get 
l^8Z^(8)  _ij &=&(6h^(1)  _kl h^(3)  ^kl 
   +4h^(2)  _kl h^(2)  ^kl 
   -10h^(2)  ^kl h^(1)  _l  ^m h^(1)  _mk )g_ij
