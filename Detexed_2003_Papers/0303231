    Abstract 


We realize the CFT with target a lens space  as a simple current construction. This 
allows us to compute the boundary states and the annuli coefficients, and in particular 
to study the B-type branes, in purely algebraic terms. 
Several issues, like the appearance of fractional branes and symmetry breaking boundary 
conditions, can be addressed more directly
in this approach than in a more geometric treatment. 




Introduction 

Boundary conditions in rational conformal field theories have been the focus of intense study
over the past few years.  For a very large class of theories, those with partition function of 
simple current type , the boundary conditions are known explicitly.
The best-known examples of these are WZW models on non-simply connected groups, 
where there is a target space interpretation of both the bulk model and of its boundary 
conditions.

Recently, there has been interest in theories whose target spaces are  quotients 
of Lie groups by discrete subgroups.
The simplest non-trivial example of such theories are those with the target being a 
lens space . Geometrically,
this space is obtained by quotienting the group manifold  by the left action of the 
subgroup  of one of its maximal tori, so 
that the elements  and  of 
are identified, for  integer and  the generator of a maximal torus.   
This -action has no fixed points, so the lens spaces are smooth 
manifolds; they inherit a metric and volume form from the
translation invariant metric and volume form of the covering space .
The quotienting is therefore easily implemented in the sigma-model description of any 
WZW model.  However, in order that integrality of the Wess-Zumino term 
is preserved, and since  is acting freely, the level  of the
 WZW model must be a multiple of the order of , 
i.e. . We denote the  resulting lens space CFT by .  
Performing a T-duality transformation along the maximal torus that has  
as a subgroup on the CFT  gives the theory . Lens spaces have for example been used as backgrounds for string propagation,
and in particular they appeared in the bosonization of the near horizon limit 
of a four-dimensional black hole. 


Boundary conditions in lens spaces 
were studied in from a geometric perspective, different from ours.   
It turns out that the CFT can be regarded as
an asymmetric orbifold with phenomena such as fractional branes, as was known 
 for the special case  
(in which the orbifold is not asymmetric) which is described by the CFT .  
Furthermore, via T-duality one obtains a different kind of branes, called B-branes. 

In this note we show that the CFT  can be described as a simple current 
construction from the CFT  at level , 
with non-trivial discrete torsion. Here  denotes the parafermions  
and  is a rational free boson.
The formalism is in particular adapted to describing the fractional branes, 
thus allowing us to recover and generalize some results of regarding 
boundary states for A- and B branes and annulus amplitudes, and to resolve 
some issues which in the CFT description involves fixed points of 
the simple current action, that are hard to understand with purely geometric methods. 
Our approach yields all boundary conditions that preserve the  chiral 
algebra on the same footing, i.e. in the case of  both the -symmetric
boundary conditions that were studied in and the -breaking ones 
that in the large  limit correspond to certain twisted conjugacy classes.

One can think of two natural extensions of the problems approached in this paper;
both directions represent an interesting challenge.
The first is to construct more general
boundary states in  using more general  boundary states;
this requires a better understanding of  boundary states, which is a problem
of independent interest. 
The second direction is to study theories obtained by
modding out non-abelian subgroups of , including their fixed point structures.  
The inverse operation to forming such a non-abelian orbifold is an extension that
generalizes simple current extensions; methods for performing such constructions
explicitly have been introduced only recently. In the case at hand,
one should in particular perform such constructions starting from
the theory  instead of
, with  denoting the  orbifold of the free boson.
This would in particular 
allow one to
describe the - and -type boundary conditions on the same footing.




Lens spaces as CFTs of simple current type 

Simple current constructions 

To study branes in lens spaces, we start by describing the closed string 
spectrum of the CFTs , 
that is, their torus partition functions.
The simple current modular invariants that give rise to consistent
conformal field theories have been classified (, see also)
and indeed
constitute the vast majority of known rational CFTs. 
Starting from a chiral RCFT with chiral algebra  and irreducible 
-representations labelled by , with characters ,
a modular invariant is of simple current type if all its terms are of the form  
 with  a simple current and  the fusion product. These theories 
are characterized (up to exceptional simple current invariants, see for instance) by the choice of a simple current group  
and by a certain matrix . 
Here  is a finite abelian group (with respect to the 
fusion product); it can be written as
 with 
.
Picking a set of generators  of , one defines the off-diagonal part of a symmetric 
 matrix  by the relative monodromy charges:
 mod . 
The diagonal part of  is required to satisfy  mod . 
The symmetric part of the  matrix  is then fixed by ,
while its antisymmetric part, called discrete torsion, is constrained by .  
(Note that this 
is not necessarily the same concept as the discrete torsion that arises in 
geometric orbifolds.)

We denote the theory constructed from  with simple current 
group  and matrix  by .
Denoting an element of  by , 
the modular invariant torus partition function
of the theory  is the combination
Z = __J^s  G   (_i=1  ^q
    ^1 (Q_J_i  ()+X_ij  s_i))
    _  _J^s  ^    of -characters. Here  if  and  else.
The left and right kernels of the matrix  determine the extension of the left and right
chiral algebras, respectively; thus when they are different,
the modular invariant () is left-right asymmetric.  

SU(2) 

The parafermion theory  can be constructed as a  coset 
model at level , as described e.g. in. 
The primary fields of  are labelled by pairs of integers
 with , ,
subject to the selection rule , i.e.  and  must have the 
same parity.
Furthermore, the labels  and  describe one and the
same field. This is known as field identification and will be denoted by
;
the selection rule as well as the field identification arise naturally in the  coset
construction. The conformal dimension of a primary field labelled  is 
 for  and 
 for .


Our conventions for the rational free boson CFT  are that the primary fields
are labelled by , in terms of which the conformal 
dimensions are  for  and 
 for .
In the tensor product theory 
 we have a simple current group  that is
generated by the field  which acts as .
Using the fact that the discrete torsion of a cyclic group is 
necessarily trivial, and that
_mZ_2k 2m+j  _(j,m) ^PF_k _(m) ^U(1)_k 
=^SU(2)_k _j , one can check that, when applied to the 
theory with this choice of simple current group, 
the prescription () gives us the charge conjugation  partition function, 
hence .

Lens spaces  

The torus partition functions
for the lens space CFTs have been obtained by requiring level 
matching of the twisted vertex operators on the orbifold , as well as the right  symmetry to be preserved, as
Z( L _k,k_1  ) = _j=0  ^k
 ( _n-n' = 0 2k_2n+n' = 0 2k_1  
 _jn ^PF_k _n' ^U(1)_k )   ^SU(2)_k  _j  , where  and .
In view of chardec , this is a combination of parafermion and  characters,
with the left and right combinations of labels all connected by the action of suitable
simple currents. Any such partition function is of simple current type (see); thus
the lens space CFT can be obtained as a simple current construction 
from the  theory. Furthermore, since partition  is 
left-right asymmetric, we need at least a  matrix , and hence a non-cyclic 
simple current group with at least two factors, . 
And since we have -characters on the right, we need in particular all those 
currents that appear in the construction of the  theory, hence we 
let one of these factors be . 
One can also check that () with , 
i.e.  gives the  
WZW theory at level , which is a  simple current construction.
It is therefore natural to try a simple current group 
 with . 
We take again the generator 
for the  factor,
and 
for the  factor, respectively.  

Imposing the general restrictions on the  matrix , we are left with
a  degree of freedom in the discrete torsion.  Its value can be
determined by requiring that the right-moving characters combine to  characters, 
which means that  must be contained in the right
kernel of . This yields 
X = [   ] .
Inserting the simple current group  with choice matrix1 
for  into equation
(), we get indeed the modular invariant (), with . Allowed choices of discrete torsion  different from the one in
() yield other simple current constructions, which are again
consistent CFTs. One may wonder whether those theories
possess a sensible target space interpretation as well, which
would lead to a geometric interpretation of discrete torsion.

Since the  characters obey  as 
functions of the modular parameter , the partition function of the lens space 
CFT is invariant under , that is 
.  
In CFT terms this involutive action on the left-movers is just a  charge conjugation; 
geometrically, it acts in the appropriate way on the radial parameter of the lens space 
metric and on the string coupling so as to interpret it as a T-duality.
It has already been observed in that the spectrum described by 
partition  contains winding states.
Since the size of the orbifold group that is modded out to get the lens space from
the  manifold is , 
it is tempting to interpret the combination , which
is defined mod , as winding number and the combination , defined 
mod , as momentum. Then the transformation  amounts to interchanging
winding number and momentum, supporting its interpretation as a T-duality.
Note that - as in the case of tori, and unlike in the case of  - the presence 
of winding states prevents us from having an interpretation
of the space of lowest weight states as (a truncation of) the space of functions
on the manifold .

The action by the fusion product of the simple current group  on the 
primary fields of the  theory
may have fixed points. This happens iff 
K:=(k,0,0)(0,k,0)= (0,2,2)^k/2  (0,0,2k_2)^k_1 /2 G _k,k_1 ,

which requires 
, and hence , to be even.  Then 
, where the last step is the field 
identification of . The field  appears with multiplicity two in the partition function
iff both  and  are even.






The boundary states and annulus amplitudes 

The boundary states for CFTs of simple current type have been built in 
. More precisely, in only the case of trivial discrete torsion 
was studied, because it allows for discussing also amplitudes on non-orientable
world sheets. However, the relevant results from are also applicable 
for non-trivial discrete torsion.


Boundary blocks 

We first describe the boundary blocks, or Ishibashi states. 
They are three-point conformal blocks with insertions 
of a primary field , its charge conjugate  and some simple current , 
of which  is a fixed point. We denote  the simple current group and 
 is the stabilizer of . The boundary blocks thus
correspond to primaries that are combined  
with their charge conjugate in the partition function of the extended theory. 
Applying the results of
, it follows that in terms of the  theory 
they are labelled by pairs  with  that satisfy the requirement
Q_J ()+X(J,F),     JG .
Note that here the choice of discrete torsion enters explicitly. 

In our case, all the stabilizers are trivial, that is , 
except when  is even in which case we have 
, generated by
 as given in (). 
We first concentrate on the trivial element  of the stabilizers. We have 
 and the requirement () is 
. This means  mod 
 and  mod . Thus we have Ishibashi labels of the type
(,)   with    and    with  and .
For a pair  with  the requirement 
() is  mod  and  mod . 
The corresponding Ishibashi labels are
(,K)   with    and    K=(0,k,0)(k,0,0),
with .
When  is even we have  Ishibashi labels of this kind. 
The total number of Ishibashi labels is then

I=  
	.
We label the boundary blocks by 
 with 
 for the boundary blocks in () and () respectively. 
Following, we use the label  to indicate that they preserve the full 
 symmetry, as opposed to the ones discussed below, labelled .
We normalize the A-type boundary blocks as
A; j',r', F'  q^L_0 1  +1 L_0 - c/12 
 A; j,r, F =
     _jj' _rr'  _FF'  _j,rk_1 ^PF_k (q^2) _rk_1 ^U(1)_k  (q^2).
    


Boundary states 

The boundary states are labelled by -orbits on the set of 
all chiral labels of the unextended  theory, possibly with
multiplicities. More concretely, they are labelled by pairs  
with  a representative of a -orbit and  
a -character. Here , the 
central stabilizer, is a subgroup in the stabilizer of square index. 
Since in the case at hand, the stabilizer has at most two elements, 
it follows that  for all . For cyclic groups, 
the values of the character are -th roots of unity, 
hence they are signs for our considerations. 
Orbits whose fields do not appear in the torus partition function correspond to boundary 
conditions that break at least part of the (maximally extended)
bulk symmetry; 
they cannot be obtained
by the procedure of averaging Cardy boundary conditions over the orbifold group,
which is e.g. used in.

In all cases except , 
the  labels for the orbits can be represented by
with    0j k/2,
where  is the integer part of . The dummy index 
 appearing here is chosen so that , and . 
We will sometimes condense the notation and supress the dummy 
index , and instead label boundary states by , with the 
character displayed only when it is nontrivial. All  fields lie in 
such an orbit; the only subtlety is that some of the orbits () can actually be 
identical. This happens iff the simple current 
 is in , 
which due to field identification acts as  on the label . 
For this current to appear we need  and . In that case, 
the orbits are labelled by  with , 
and , and there is a 
second kind of orbits labelled by  now with . One can check 
that the number of boundary states equals the number of Ishibashi 
states, as predicted from the general theory (see e.g. ).
      
For any simple current construction, the boundary coefficients that appear 
in the expression 
 of the boundary 
states in terms of Ishibashi blocks are given byB_(,F),[,] =G  S_ C_   
_F S^F _,  S_,   (F)^*,
where the indices  are  indices and 
 is a phase, in the present case an eighth root of unity. It can be choosen to be  for  and , and  in all other cases.  
is the modular transformation matrix for 1-point blocks with insertion  
on the torus, in particular . A current  gives rise to 
nontrivial matrix elements  only if both  and  are 
fixed by . 


The  -  matrix reads
S_(jmn),(j'm'n') ^PF U(1) 
=2S_j,j' ^SU(2) S_n,n' ^U(1) (S_m,m' ^U(1) )^*,
with
S_n,n' ^U(1) =1 2k  ^-nn' k  ,
       
S_j,j' ^SU(2) =2 k+2  (
(j'+1)(j+1) k+2 ).
In case  is odd, the stabilizers are all trivial and . 
All boundary states  that are related to trivial characters 
can be expressed as
 

In case  is even, there are nontrivial stabilizers and we must take 
into account the character  of . The boundary coefficients ()
depend on whether the stabilizing current  is trivial or not. For , 
the boundary coefficients are just as above,
so for , 
we can express the boundary state in terms of boundary blocks again as 
in equation (). So in case  we have also a summation 
over the Ishibashi states appearing in (),
A,k/2,s,&=&kk_1  2 (
_j=0,2,...,k r=0,1,...,2k_2-1  
S_(j,rk_1,rk_1),(k/2,n,n+s)  S_,(j,rk_1,rk_1)   
A;j,r,

&&+_r=0,1,...,2k_2-1 
_K(K)S^K _(k/2,k/2+rk_1,k/2+rk_1),(k/2,n,n+s)  
S_,(k/2,k/2+rk_1,k/2+rk_1)   
A,k/2,r,K ),
where we omitted the superscript  on the S-matrices because this
can be recognized from the form of the (multi-)labels that appear of the indices. The  matrix appearing in frac  
be factorized in its  and  parts just like the ordinary  matrix,
S^K _(k/2,n',m'),(k/2,n,m) =1 k  S^K,SU(2) _k/2,k/2 ^ k (n'n-m'm) 
=1 k  D^ k (n'n-m'm) 
with . 
These branes are called "fractional" branes, reflecting the additional factor of 
 in () (which then also arises in the annulus amplitude 
()), as opposed to the ones which involve only a 
summation over the boundary blocks in ().


B-type branes 

 Recall that from inspection of the lens space partition function () and the 
relation , one sees that the T-dual (along the 
Cartan subalgebra  in ) of the  theory is the
 theory.  The T-duals of the A-type branes constructed
above in  give a new type of branes in , 
called B-type branes.
These can be studied by
regarding the boundary blocks of  as tensor products 
of the boundary blocks of the parafermion and free boson theories.
Indeed, since T-duality amounts to changing the sign of the 
 label  in the left-moving field labelled , 
leaving the  labels unchanged, the B-type boundary blocks 
can be written as
B;j,rk_2,rk_2, ^L _k,k_1  

=A;j,rk_2^PF_k B;rk_2^U(1)_k .
where the label  on the right is to remind us that we have to
switch sign on the left-moving momentum,
. These will be seen to give nonvanishing contributions only for  mod  in section .
The B-type branes in the  theory are T-dual to A-type branes in 
. This gives for the nonfractional branes
 
with the range of  as before but  interchanged with . 
Likewise, for the fractional branes which arise iff , we get from performing T-duality on 
() expressed with  interchanged with ,
&&  B;k/2,s,^L _k,k_1  =kk_2  2 (
_j=0,2,...,k r=0,1,...,2k_1-1  
S_(j,rk_2,rk_2),(k/2,n,n+s)  S_,(j,rk_2,rk_2)   
A;j,rk_2^PF_k B;rk_2^U(1)_k  


&&+ _r=0,1,...,2k_1-1 
_K(K)S^K _(k/2,k/2+rk_2,k/2+rk_2),(k/2,n,n+s)  
S_,(k/2,k/2+rk_2,k/2+rk_2)   
A; + rk_2^PF_k B; + rk_2^U(1)_k 
).
SU(2) 

Now let ,  in which case we recover the  theory. 
We see in () and in () that we 
get more boundary blocks and boundary states than discussed in, who found 
the boundary states with , which gives the Cardy formula 
for  symmetry preserving boundary states. Note that imposing 
amounts to a restriction to a subspace in the space of boundary blocks. 
In contrast, when allowing for all boundary blocks obtained above, we get 
all  preserving boundary states; except for , they
do not preserve the full  symmetry.

Now the B-branes in  are T-dual to the A-branes of 
. For the case , the results of 
for B-branes are recovered by setting . The 
most interesting -branes are the fractional ones, which are not discussed 
in detail in. They correspond to the fixed point arising when , 
  
For , i.e. , our results agree with those of 
.




Remark 
We emphasize the fact that the simple current construction yields directly the correct boundary
states, in particular the appropriate set of boundary blocks and reflection coefficients.
In other approaches, like the one of, the reflection coefficients are 
determined by imposing the NIMrep properties of the annulus coefficients. 
This is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for the CFT to make sense;
indeed, many NIMreps are known which do not appear in any consistent CFT
(see e.g. ).
The simple current construction can be shown to yields NIMreps that are physical,
i.e. do belong to a consistent CFT; thus the boundary conditions studied
here (and hence in particular those also discussed in) are indeed physical.


As already mentioned in the introduction, starting from  instead 
of , with  the  orbifold of the free boson,
would allow one to describe the -type boundary conditions on the same footing
as the A-type conditions. Unfortunately, while both the extension from 
 to  and the construction of 
from  are simple current construction, this is no longer true for the
construction of  directly from , because
in terms of the latter theory, the simple currents in  correspond to
fields of quantum dimension 2. Describing A- and B-type conditions in this manner
will therefore require to apply the results of on such more general constructions.




Annulus coefficients 
In the closed string channel the annulus amplitude with boundary conditions  is
A_a ^ b (t)=a^-2 t (L_0 1  +1 L_0 - c/12) b.
In the open string channel, we can expand the amplitude in terms of characters as
.
For a simple current construction, the annulus coefficients  appearing in this expansion are given byA_[a,_a] ^ [b,_b] 
=_(,J) B_(,J)[a,_a] B^*_(,J^c)[b,_b] S^ _ .
This formula depends on the choice of discrete torsion through the restrictions 
on the summation over Ishibashi labels.
In case  is odd, the result is
A_[j_a,s_a] ^(j',n',m') [j_b,s_b] =^2k_2 (s_a- s_b+ n'- m') N_j_aj_b ^j' ,
where  are the  fusion rules.

Now we consider the case  is even. If none of the orbits  is a fixed point, we get
A_[j_a,s_a] ^(j',n',m') [j_b,s_b] &=&^2k_2 (s_a- s_b+ n'- m')
(N_j_aj_b ^j' +N_j_aj_b ^k/2-j' ).
In case precisely one of the boundary labels is a fixed point, the computation is similar, since
the appearing  matrix elements vanish, and

(which does not depend on ). In case both orbits  are fixed points we have to 
include both types of Ishibashi labels in the summation. We get
A_[ ,s_a,_a] ^(j',n',m')[ ,s_b,_b] 
=1 2 ^2k_2  (s_a- s_b+ n'- m')(N_ ,
  ^j' 
+  ^s_a- s_b+n'-m' _a_b
((j'+  ))).
Note that this is always a non-negative integer, since the fusion rule  
is nonvanishing exactly when  is, 
and  due to the Kronecker delta in the prefactor. 

To sum up, the annulus coefficients are













with , , 
 and . 
This generalizes the results of who considered 
boundary states with , and where the details on the last amplitude where 
not carried out explicitly. 
All amplitudes 
depend only on the difference , which is consistent with the results 
 below that indicate that the branes with  correspond to averaging over 
the  orbits of twisted conjugacy classes in the covering space.




On the geometry of the branes  
In this section, we discuss the geometry of the branes following.
A brane on  is a linear combination of Ishibashi states, or boundary blocks . These are linear functionals  and we can restrict this action to the horizontal submodules . In the large  limit, all  are allowed and we can  identify the boundary blocks 
with functions  on the group manifold through the Peter-Weyl isomorphism 
B_j' (g)=_j,m_L,m_R  j+1 V   B_j' (v_m_L ^jv_m_R ^j)
v_m_L ^j  R^j(g) v_m_R ^j,
with  a basis of the  module  with highest weight , and  the volume of the group manifold . Recall that the lens space  is the set of equivalence classes of  group elements with the equivalence relation .
A function on  is independent of the choice of representative of such a class, and therefore a function on the lens space, iff  only for  mod . For convenience we then still write a group element, instead of an equivalence class, as argument for such a function. In geometric terms, the isomorphism will give us the profile of the branes as probed by the tachyons on the target space. Similar expressions result
when the graviton, dilaton and Kalb-Ramond fields are used as probes; qualitatively,
they all give the same profile.  

The Ishibashi states for the lens space CFT are expressed as  in terms of  and  Ishibashi states. We decompose the functions on , and the corresponding states, into functions (states) on  and ,  , such that , and 
B_j',rk_1 ^PF (w^j_(m_L+m_R)/2 )=_j,j' ^4k  _2rk_1,m_L+m_R +_j,k-j' ^4k  _2rk_1-2k,m_L+m_R ,
where field identification of the boundary blocks is taken into account. (In the special case , we have  states in the  representation whereas the range of Ishibashi only allows  states. Accordingly one linear combination of  and  is annihilated by all Ishibashi states.)
The shape of the regular A-branes is
B_j,s (g)=k_1 
_j'=0,1,...,k r=-k_2,-k_2+1,...k_2-12(j'+rk_1)   

S_j,j' 
D^j' _rk_1,rk_1 (g_s)

   S_j,j' := S_j,j' ^SU(2)  j'+1 S_0,j' ^SU(2) V 
  ,     
g_s:=^-s k H g  ,   and      
D^j _m,n (g):=v_m ^j  R^j(g) v_n ^j .
The latter matrix element vanishes unless . We interpret  as parametrizing a rotation of the brane. Since  except for the exceptional case, we see that the exponent in  has the range , where the rightmost expression is the one we are orbifolding. 

For the fractional branes, we also need the fractional Ishibashi states, where the analogue to the second term in AI  gives a nonzero contribution. The shape of the fractional brane is
B_s, (g)=kk_1  2 
_j'=0,2,...,k r=-k_2,-k_2+1,...,k_2-1  
S_j,j' 
D^j' _rk_1,rk_1 (g_s)
+ k_1 V   ^-3k8  
 ^2 _k_2,0 _r=k/2 
D^k/2 _r,r (g_s),
with  and  as in gS .
The two fractional branes have the same shape unless , due to . 

For the A- branes on , i. e. the lens space with , the shape reduces to


. For , these branes are the standard Cardy branes described in(With one term missing in the  character due to problems with matching the space of functions on the lens space to the set of Ishibashi labels.) . At finite level, the support of the profile, which one would like to interpret as
the world volume of the brane, is in fact the whole target space. But it is peaked around
a conjugacy class (if ) respectively a tilted conjugacy classes (if ) of ,
so that at finite level one can think of it as a smeared brane at the (tilted) conjugacy class
. 

For the B-branes in lens spaces, we have to use the B-type  Ishibashi states, acting as
. 
The shape of the nonfractional B-branes is given by
B^B_j,s (g)=k_2 
_j'=0,1,...,k r=0,k_1  2(j'+rk_2)  
S_k/2,j' 
D^j' _rk_2,rk_2 (g_s)=B^B_j,0 (g_s),
  with , or  in the case . In particular, for  it is
  B^B_j,s (g)=k 
 _j'=0,2,...,2[k/2] 
 S_j,j' 
 D^j' _0,0 (g_s)
 +k 
 S_j,k 
 D^k _k,k (g_s)
  The fractional B-brane that arises when  has the shape
B ^B _s, (g)
=k_2  2
_j'=0,2,...,k r=0,k_1  
S_k/2,j' 
D^j' _rk_2,rk_2 (g_s)
+^2_k_1,0 
  ^-3 8  
D^k/2 _0,0 (g_s)k_2 V (k+2 2 )^14  .
By power-counting in , we see the  dependent terms in frac 
 and Bfrac  do not contribute to the shape of the fractional branes in the 
 limit of large level.

Flux stabilization of the branes 

The flux quantization mechanism for A-branes in  can 
be used to establish similar results for A-branes in lens spaces. A nonfractional A-brane in the lens space 
 is a projection to  
of a union 
of (twined) conjugacy classes in . In the large level limit, the shape of the fractional branes can also be seen as such projections and we can do a similar discussion as the one below. 
The  flux stabilization mechanism applies independently to each of
the pre-images of the lens space brane.
The stabilizing fields in general depend on the pre-image
just by a multiplicative factor.

The variational problem in the lens space can now be rephrased as a variational problem
in .  The Born-Infeld action for the brane in the lens space is proportional to
the sum of the Born-Infeld terms describing the branes in the covering space.
Each of the image  branes is a stable solution to the Born-Infeld
variational problem. 
So, in particular, the value of the action is stable under fluctuations that 
survive the projection to the lens space.
Hence  constitutes a solution of the Born-Infeld equations of 
motion for the lens space. In the particular example of , these results are illustrated 
in.
