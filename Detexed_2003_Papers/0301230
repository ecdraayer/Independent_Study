We construct  low energy effective Lagrangians for 3d 
supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory with any gauge group.
They represent supersymmetric  models at
hyper-Kahlerian manifolds of dimension  ( is the rang
of the group).
In the asymptotic region, perturbatively exact explicit
expression for the metric are written.
We establish the relationship of this metric
with  the TAUB-NUT metric describing
the perturbatively exact effective
Lagrangians for unitary groups and  monopole moduli spaces:
the former is obtained out of the latter by a proper
hyper-Kahlerian reduction.
We describe in details the reduction procedure for 
gauge groups, where it can also be given a natural interpretation
in -brane language.
We conjecture that the exact nonperturbative
metrics can be obtained by a similar hyper-Kahlerian
reduction from the corresponding multidimensional Atiyah-Hitchin metrics.



Introduction 

In a very well-known  paper,
Seiberg and Witten have found the exact effective
low-energy Lagrangian for 4d  supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theories for the  gauge group. This result was
later generalised to other gauge groups .
A related interesting question is what is the form of the effective
Lagrangian in lower-dimensional "descendants" of 4d 
SYM theory, the models obtained from it by dimensional reduction.

Going down to 3d, we obtain   (in the
3-dimensional sense)
SYM theory. Its effective Lagrangian was constructed  in the
 case in. It represents a
hyper-Kahlerian supersymmetric  model on the
Atiyah-Hitchin  manifold. This metric also
describes the dynamics of two interacting BPS
monopoles, the moduli space of classical vacua in SYM theory
exactly coinciding with the monopole moduli space.
Indeed, the low-energy dynamics in the former involves
3 scalars originating from the components of
Abelian vector potentials in the original
6d  theory in the reduced dimensions and a scalar
dual to the 3d photon. And this corresponds to a relative distance
of two monopoles and their relative phase.

In the asymptotics when the distance  between the
monopoles becomes large, this metric goes
over to the TAUB-NUT metric (with negative mass term),
  2ds^2  =  ( 1 - g^2 2r  
) dr ^2 + 
(d+ g^2 2  )^2 
( 1 - g^2 2r  
)   ,
 where  is the relative phase of the monopoles and
  ( r )  =    d    is the Abelian connection describing a Dirac monopole. The factor 2 on the left side is a convention introduced to make contact with Eq.() below.

 The Atiyah-Hitchin metric  can also be written explicitly it terms of elliptic
functions. It differs from () by a series of exponentially
 suppressed at large distances terms. This series corresponds to a sum over
instantons in the 3d SYM theory.

The asymptotical TAUB-NUT metric () is singular at .
 But the full Atiyah-Hitchin metric is not: there is no physical reason for the
kinetic energy to become singular when the distance between monopoles
becomes small or vanishes. Actually, the AH metric can be reconstructed  from
the requirement that it describes a smooth hyper-Kahlerian manifold and concides
with Eq.() in the asymptotics.

These results were generalized in Ref. to 
groups. Again, the effective Lagrangian represents a
hyper-Kahlerian  model on the generalized
Atiyah-Hitchin manifold of dimension . This also
describes the dynamics of  BPS monopoles. In the asymptotics, one obtains a generalized TAUB-NUT metric
   
where   is the following  matrix:
     A_mm  &=& 1 - g^2 4  _lm  1r _m - r _l               (no summation over    m), 

A_ml   &=& g^2 4r _m - r _l ,
                          (m l) ,
  and
 

 The explicit expressions for the generalized AH metric were not
found yet, but a conjecture 
 of existence and uniqueness can be
 formulated:
there is only one smooth
hyper-Kahlerian manifold of dimension 
 with the asymptotics ().

One can also consider the 2d and 1d dimensionally reduced versions
of  the original theory and study the corresponding effective
Lagrangians there. In the 2d case, this was done for  in
Ref. and for an arbitrary gauge group in Ref..
The effective Lagrangian also represents in this case a
supersymmetric  model on a manifold of  dimensions, where  is the
rank of the group.
The coordinates of  target space correspond to four
 components of Abelian (belonging to the Cartan subalgebra) 6d vector potentials
associated with the reduced dimensions. In 2 dimensions, there are no dynamical
degrees of freedom associated with gauge fields.
The model involves four complex supercharges.
However, it is not a hyper-Kahlerian  model, but rather a
twisted    model of the class described in Ref..
In the simplest  case, the bosonic part of the Euclidean Lagrangian takes
the form
(This expression differs from Eq.(3.23) of Ref. by the presence of
the factor , which appears after Wick rotation.) 
      L ^bos    =
 [ 1 - g^2_2 2(+ )  ]
  [  _^2 +  _^2 ]   

 + ig^2_2 _  2(+ ) 
 [      (_)(_)
+   (_)(_)
 ]   ,
     where  is the 2d gauge coupling constant,
 is expressed into reduced Abelian gauge potentials of the original 4d theory, and
 is the Abelian complex scalar
field there (if lifting up to  ,
 is also expressed into 5-th and 6-th components
 of the gauge potentials).
 The first term in Eq.() describes a certain complex
metric (which is not  Kahlerian).
The second twisted term can be associated with torsion.



The result () can be obtained by evaluating one-loop diagrams.
Higher loops vanish due to supersymmetry. And not only that.  In two
dimensions,  supersymmetry together with rotational 
 invariance of the moduli space
rigidly fix the functional form of the metric, 
which makes the result
() exact . Another way to see this is to notice that
our 2d gauge theory (in contrast to its 3d and 4d "parents") does not
involve instantons of the usual type and the effective Lagrangian does not 
acquire
any nonperturbative contributions. 
(One can note, however,  that 
 2d non-Abelian gauge theories containing only adjoint fields
involve the so called  instantons.  
It would be interesting to pinpoint the precise reason by which
they do not contribute in this case.)  

A similar problem can be posed and solved for the quantum mechanical model
obtained after reduction of the original theory down to  dimensions.
This was done in Ref.. The effective
Lagrangian involves  bosonic variables.
It represents a generalization of the
nonstandard    model living on 5-dimensional
target space, which was constructed in Ref..


The only problem that has not been  solved yet is  constructing  the effective Lagrangians
for 3d theories with nonunitary gauge groups.
This is done in the present article. The basic observation which
allows one to obtain the results in a simple and universal way is that effective Lagrangians
in different dimensions are all related to each other.  The relationship between 4d and 3d
effective Lagrangians was
discussed back in. In Refs., a similar  relationship between
1d and 2d effective Lagrangians was exploited to determine the form of the latter.  In this
 paper we start from the 2d effective Lagrangian and reconstruct the 3d one.

In the next section we illustrate our method by rederiving the results for  by our
method. The generalization to all other groups is
rather straightforward. In Sect. 3 we explore in details the groups ,  for odd
and even , and  and establish the
relationship of the corresponding hyper-Kahler manifolds with monopole moduli spaces.
The former are obtained  from the latter by the procedure of
hyper-Kahlerian reduction . Basically, it consists in our case
in imposing certain constraints on monopole dynamic variables which are compatible
with equations of motion.



In Sect. 4, we give a natural  D-brane
interpretation of the results obtained along the lines of with insertion of the proper
orientifolds.

Construction of  


 The basic idea is to consider the original  SYM theory not on  and not  on , but
rather on , in the spirit of. Playing with the
length   of the circle, one can interpolate between 2d and 3d pictures.

The Lagrangian () was obtained after integrating out the charged fields in 2d theory. Thinking in 2d terms, we have now an infinite number of charged fields representing the coefficients in the Fourier series
      f(x,y; z)  = _k = - ^f_k(x,y) e^2i kz/L   .
   The relevant variables in the effective Lagrangian are still
 zero Fourier modes of the neutral fields ,  and their superpartners.
The expression () is replaced by the infinite sum
  L    =
 [ 1 - g_2^2 2   _n = - ^1(_n _n + )  ]
  [  _^2 +  _^2
]   

 + i _n = - ^ g_2^2_  2(_n
_n + ) 
 [  _n    (_)(_)  + _n  (_)(_)
 ]   ,
where  (and also
).
(The fields  should not be confused with the spatial coordinates
.) 

In the limit , only one term in the sum survives and we are reproducing the
 previous result. But for large  all terms are essential.
In the limit
 , we can actually replace the sum by an integral.  We obtain
  L   = (12 - g^2 4r   )
[ (_r  )^2 + (_)^2 ] 

+ ig^2 2   (r ) _  __r  ,
 where  is the 3-dimensional gauge coupling constant, 
, and   is
defined in Eq.().
 The variables  live on  whereas the variable  lives on the dual circle,
. When  is very large, the size of the dual circle is very small
which would normally imply that the excitations related to nonzero Fourier modes of 
would become heavy and decouple. This happens, for example, when the 2d effective Lagrangian
is reconstructed with this method from
the 1d one: the latter involves  dynamic bosonic degrees of freedom, while
the former - only . But in our case it would not be correct just to cross out the terms
involving . The presence of the twisted term  prevents us to
do it.

To understand it, consider a trivial toy model,
   L  = 12 (x ^2 + y ^2) + B x y      H = 12 [ p_x^2  + (p_y - Bx)^2 ] ,
 where , while  is restricted to lie on a small circle,
. The Lagrangian () describes a particle living on a   cylinder and moving in a  constant magnetic field . Now, if the magnetic field  were absent, the higher Fourier modes of the variable  would be heavy and the low-energy spectrum would be continuous
corresponding to free motion along  direction.
When , for each  Fourier mode of the variable , we obtain
 the same  oscillatorial spectrum. Only the position of the center of the orbit and not the energy depends on .

Thus, we cannot  suppress the variable  in the Lagrangian (). Likewise,  we cannot  suppress the variable  in Eq.(). What we can do, however, is to trade it to another variable using the duality  trick. Let us  write instead of () another Lagrangian
   L   = (12 - g^2 4r   )
[ (_r  )^2 +  B_^2 ] 

+ i _  B_[ _+
g^2 2 
 (r )  _r  ] .
  Now, integrating  over  gives us 
 which implies that . Substituting it in Eq.(), we reproduce the result
().
On the other hand, we can integrate over  in Eq. (). Doing this,  we obtain the  model Lagrangian on the
manifold () !
(A general statement of Ref. is that, if the manifold corresponding to a twisted  model involves an isometry (the metric and torsion do not depend on some variables), the duality transfromations with respect to these variables brings us
onto a hyper-Kahlerian manifold. See Appendix for some further clarifications.) 


This derivation can be readily generalized for other groups. The effective 2d Lagrangian for an arbitrary group depends on the variables ,  , .
Putting the theory on  and doing the sum over all Fourier harmonics
of charged fields (which for large  can be replaced by the integral
  over , we obtain the bosonic Euclidean
effective Lagrangian in the following form
   L   = _j(1c_V  - g^2 4r ^(j)   )
[ (_r ^(j)  )^2 + (_^(j)  )^2 ] 

+ ig^2 2 
_j  (r ^(j) ) _  _^(j)  _r ^(j)  ,
  where , , and the sum runs over all positive roots  of the corresponding Lie algebra. Performing the duality transformation and trading , we obtain
      L  = 12 (_r ^a )  (_r ^b ) Q_ab  + 12  J_^a Q^-1 _ab  J_^b  ,
    where
     Q^ab  &=& ^ab  - g^2 2  _j  _j^a _j^b r ^(j)   , 

 J_^a &=&  _^a +
 g^2 2  _j  (r ^(j) )
 _r ^(j)  _j^a  .
  
The relation 
 (with the normalisation
 for the long roots) was
used.




 and monopole dynamics. 


Specialization of Eq.() to particular groups is
naturally interpreted
 in terms of metrics on BPS monopoles moduli spaces.


i)  . This case was first considered in. There are 
positive roots, 
.
Substituting
 it in Eq. (), we reproduce the result
().
(   Note that for  simply laced , there is no difference
between roots and coroots.
There is such difference  - and this will be important below -
in  and  cases. ) 

The monopole dynamics is described by the  following classical
equations of motion(Here  is interpreted as the monopole magnetic charge. In the quantum problem,  are quantized to (integer)/ and are interpreted as the electric charges of the corresponding dyons.) 
   r  _l - g^2 4  _ml ^N r  _lm   r _ml   + g^2 8  _l m = 1 ^N 2[r  _ml  r _ml 
] r  _ml  - r _ml  (r  _ml ^2)  r_ml ^3  

- g 4  _m l    (q_ml ) r  _ml  r _ml  r_ml ^3  + 18  _m l   q_ml ^2 r _ml  r_ml ^3   = 0 , 

q_l  = gA^-1 _lm  [  _m + g^2 4 
_n m   ( r _nm  ) r  _nm  ]  = const  ,
 where .

ii)  . There are  long positive
roots 
and 
short positive roots   
 ( ;  are mutually orthogonal and linearly independent). The
metric reads
 
The full metric is restored from Eqs.(, ).

An important observation is that the
corresponding effective Lagrangian (the QM version thereof)
is obtained from  the effective Lagrangian describing the dynamics
 of  BPS monopoles
numbered by the integers 
by imposing the constraints
r _-r  + r _r   = = r _-1  + r _1   = 2r _0  = 0  , 

_-r  + _r   = = _-1  + _1   = 2_0  = 0 .
  We are  allowed to impose these constraints because they are compatible with the equations of motion () and also with the equations of
motion of the corresponding 2d field theory.

The corresponding  metric is hyper-Kahlerian. It follows from: 
(i)   
supersymmetry of the original theory, which implies 
 supersymmetry of the effective Lagrangian (),
(ii)  the absence of the twisted term there, and  (iii) 
the theorem due to Alvarez-Gaume and Freedman.
One can also demostrate the hyper-Kahlerian nature of the metric more 
directly by reproducing the result ()
in the framework of the  hyper-Kahlerian reduction procedure described 
in. 
The reduction of the Gibbons-Manton metric () is performed with 
respect   to the symmetry
 
where  is the phase variable of the th monopole.
The corresponding moment maps are
 
and  the hyper-Kahler reduction is made at zero value of the moment maps.

iii)  . The system of roots is the same as for  only the long and short roots are interchanged: there are now  long roots
 and  short roots .
 The metric reads
 
This metric is obtained from the Gibbons-Manton type  metric for  BPS monopoles
numbered by the integers  by
imposing the constraints
  r _-r  + r _r   = = r _-1  + r _1   = 0  , 

_-r  + _r   = = _-1  + _1    = 0
  and rescaling  and .
The constraints () are compatible with the equations of motion. The result () is also obtained by
 hyper-Kahler reduction with
respect to the symmetry
 
The corresponding moment maps are
 
and the hyper-Kahler reduction is made at zero value of the moment maps.

Note that we obtained the effective Lagrangian for  out of that for  and not out of
, as one could naively expect in view of the embedding
. Likewise, the moduli space for  is
obtained out of    and not  . This is  due to
the fact that
magnetic charges are coupled to coroots rather than roots.




iv)  . This Lie algebra is simply laced. The positive roots are

()

The metric reads
 
To relate this metric to the Gibbons-Manton
 one, we need first to introduce a massive deformation of the latter,
 
where there are  monopoles numbered by the integers
.
This metric is hyper-Kahler.
Assuming that only  are not zero, sending these parameters to infinity, and
performing the hyper-Kahler reduction with respect to the symmetry
 
with moment maps
 
and at zero value of the moment maps,  Eq.() is reduced to  Eq.() after a proper rescaling.

v)   There are three long ( ) and three short ()
positive roots (the constraint 
  being imposed). The metric reads
   ds^2  = _m=1 ^3 dr _m^2 - g^2 2 
 ( _m>l=1 ^3 (dr _m  - dr _l)^2 r _m  - r _l   + 3 _m=1 ^3 dr _m^2 r _m   ) +  .
  It can be obtained out of the metric for 
    ds^2  = _m=1 ^3 dr _m^2 -
 g^2  4 
 ( __m>l=1 ^3 (dr _m  dr _l)^2 r _m  r _l    + 2 _m=1 ^3 dr _m^2 r _m   ) +     by rescaling and  imposing the [compatible with  equations of motion] constraints
  r _1 + r _2 + r _3  = 0 ,       
_1 + _2 + _3  = 0 .
    Again, we obtained  for   out of    for  , though     is embedded not into
, but into the dual algebra .

The metric Eq.() is obtained from the  metric by the  hyper-Kahler reduction with respect to symmetry
_1 _1 +,  _2 _2 +,  _3 _3 +with moment map
  r _1 + r _2 + r _3 
  at zero value of the moment map.

The effective Lagrangian for   can be related to the moduli space of
26 monopoles. (26 is the lowest dimension of a unitary group where
 can be embedded. This follows from the fact that the representation 26  of  has the lowest dimension.)  can be embedded into
 and hence the corresponding effective Lagrangian is
 related to the moduli space of
27 monopoles. Now, the shortest representation in  has the
dimension 56 and we need at least 56 monopoles in this
case. Finally,  and we need 248 monopoles. The moduli
space of 248 monopoles can also be used as a universal starting point
to describe the dynamics
of  and , if
following the chain of embeddings 
.

The  explicit formulae we have written refer to the asymptotic region
 where nonperturbative effects are suppressed. The corresponding metrics
involve singularities at small .
Like for the  case, a very reasonable conjecture is that  these
singularities can be sewn up and, for any simple Lie group, there is one
and only one smooth hyper-Kahler metric with the asymtotics
ds^2  = dr ^a Q_ab  dr ^b +  It is  natural to conjecture that this metric is obtained
from the multimonopole Atiyah-Hitchin
metrics by the hyper-Kalerian reduction with respect to the same symmetries
as above, Eqs. (),(),(),().


Orientifolds. 


We now discuss the brane pictures behind the results obtained above.

Let us first remind that (the Coulomb branch of)
the  3d SUSY Yang-Mills with gauge group
 (The common  is standard in the brane pictures and is
essentially irrelevant.) 
is convenient to realize
as  parallel  branes stretched between two parallel  branes.
One of the directions on  brane
is of microscopic size (the distance between   branes) so from the  branes perspective there is
 gauge theory. Low energy degrees of freedom are positions of the  branes on the  branes
which gives  scalars (the branes assumed to be solid in this counting) and  photons living
on the branes, which gives other  scalars. Forgetting about the common  leaves  scalar degrees
of freedom.
The charged particles corresponding to the roots of  appears as  string states
corresponding to the strings stretched between two of the   branes, in particular, simple roots
correspond to the strings stretched between two adjacent branes of the   branes, elementary  strings.
Attributing
to the th brane the element  of the orthonormalized Euclidean basis  one sees
that the elementary F strings inherit vectors of the type of . It is easy to see that intersections
of these vectors are described by  Dynkin diagrams. One can also check that there is the appropriate amount
of supersymmetry in the brane system described.

As explained in, with use of the results of 
, the  monopole moduli space appears
if one changes the perspective from  branes to 
 branes.  Two parallel  branes give
 gauge theory, positions of the   branes 
on the  branes give positions of  monopoles
and the  scalars dual to photons living on the  branes 
give  phases to the monopoles.
Forgetting about the center-of-mass coordinate and about the 
common phase gives  dimensional
relative moduli space of  monopoles.


Consider now the case of  and of .

In the  case the brane picture consists of   branes and   orientifold
in the middle. Let us number the branes by integers .
The locations of  branes are symmetric with respect to orientifold, .
Again, one attributes to the th brane ()
the element  of the orthonormalized Euclidean basis  and
one defines . The elementary  strings are of two types - those crossing the orientifold and those
not crossing the orientifold. The ones not crossing the orientifold appear only in symmetric pairs under the reflection
with respect to the orientifold, while the ones crossing orientifold are required to be self-dual under the reflection.
Thus, the elementary strings inherit vectors , whose intersections are described by
 Dynkin diagrams.

In the  case the brane picture consists of   branes and  orientifold.
Everything is quite similar to the case of  but the rules for elementary  strings are  different.
They are  of two types - those ending on the orientifold and those not ending on the orientifold.
Crossing of the orientifold is not now allowed. All the strings appear only in symmetric pairs under the reflection
with respect to the orientifold. The elementary strings this time inherit vectors ,
whose intersections are described by  Dynkin diagrams.

Magnetically charged states appear as  strings stretched between the  branes. The orientifolds introduce different rules
for  strings and  strings. Actually, the rules for  strings in the presence of  orientifold
are the same as for  strings in the presence of  and vice versa. This fits nicely with the metrics Eqs.(), ()
in the cases of  and .

In the  case the brane picture consists of   branes and 
 orientifold.
The elementary  (and ) strings can now cross the orientifold but cannot be self-dual
under the reflection with respect to the orientifold. They thus inherit the vectors  
whose intersections are described by  Dynkin diagrams.
This is the limit  which removes from metric Eq.() the terms which would be present
if the self-dual strings were  present.

In the case of   the orientifold picture is not known. Considerations of the previous section (cf. Eqs.(), ()) suggest to conjecture
that a novel kind of  orientifold relating positions of three branes (not of two ones like in  case) is  necessary.


Aknowledgements.

and correspondence. K.S. acknowledges kind hospitality at the SUBATECH (Nantes), where this work was done.

Appendix: Twisted, Hyper-Kahler, and Duality. 

To make the paper more self-contained, we present here some relevant formulae referring to manifestly supersymmetric description of the twisted  models and the duality transformation relating them to hyper-Kahlerian models.

 The Lagrangian of a twisted supersymmetric  model
generically reads
 
 where  is a  chiral superfield,
 
and  is a   twisted chiral superfield,
 

The Lagrangian () is manifestly   supersymmetric. The requirement of
 supersymmetry imposes the constraints
 
 

The target space metric is
ds^2  = 
^2 K _tw     ^a  ^b 
d ^a d ^b  +
^2 K _tw  
 ^a  ^b 
 d ^a d  ^b  .
We emphasize that in spite of  supersymmetry, the target space is not hyper-Kahler and not even Kahler. The
Lagrangian involves also a torsion term, which
 can be expressed via  as well.

The twisted potential for the effective Lagrangian of 2d SYM theory is
 
where
 is the  Spence function,
 
 Putting the SYM theory on  and "unwinding" , we obtain
another twisted  model, where
 depends only on the sums 
 and does not depend on the differences.
It  satisfies the generalized harmonicity condition ().( The constraint () is  satisfied automatically.)

In this case, Eq.() can be rewritten as
    
where  are real superfields and  are conventional chiral
superfields. Integrating over , we  obtain
, and that implies that  can be
represented as , where  are twisted
superfields. We are thus reproducing Eq.().
On the  other hand, integrating out the superfields , we obtain




where 
 and
 is related to   by a
Legendre transformation
   
where  as a function of  is defined from the equation
    
Now,  satisfies linear  generalized harmonicity
conditions (). This dictates certain
nonlinear  conditions on the hyper-Kahler potential
. For 4-dimensional manifolds, a harmonic
function  determines the function
 satisfying the so called Monge-Ampere 
equation

   = const 
 The nonlinear equation () is must more diffucult
to solve than the Laplace equation. If you will, solving
first the Laplace
equation for  and applying the Legendre
transformation afterwards represents a regular method of finding  solutions to the Monge-Ampere equation
and, correspondingly, a wide class of hyper-Kahlerian
manifolds (the functions
 not depending on  are thus found).
Note that in all nontrivial cases, the solution of the
differential
equation () is  expressed into certain
trancendental
 functions, for which Ryzhik and Gradstein failed to reserve
 a symbol.


The hyper-Kahler metric is  computed via
the standard formulas
 
In contrast to , it is often expressed into
conventional functions
[see e.g. Eqs.(), ()].
