We study the
Nonlinear (Polynomial, -fold,...) Supersymmetry algebra in one-dimensional
QM. Its structure is
determined by the type of conjugation operation (Hermitian conjugation or
transposition) and
described with the help of the Super-Hamiltonian
projection on the zero-mode subspace of a supercharge. We show that the
SUSY algebra with transposition symmetry is always polynomial in the
Super-Hamiltonian if
supercharges represent differential operators of finite order.
The appearance of the extended SUSY with several (complex or real)
supercharges
is analyzed in details and it is established that no more than two independent
supercharges
may generate a Nonlinear superalgebra
which  can be appropriately specified as 
SUSY. In this case we find a non-trivial hidden symmetry operator
and rephrase it
as a non-linear function of the  Super-Hamiltonian on the physical state space.
The full    Non-linear SUSY algebra includes "central charges"
both polynomial and non-polynomial (due to a symmetry operator)
in the Super-Hamiltonian.

Introduction 
*2ex 
Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics nico,witten 
has been well proven as providing
efficient non-perturbative methods to explore
new isospectral quantum systems abi -sukum  (see reviews
genden -lima  and references therein) and to design nuclear
potentials with required properties baye,acd  as well as
to find  the SUSY induced hidden dynamical
symmetries ain -new  and, more specifically,
 to search for new exactly or quasi-exactly tur,shi  solvable problems in
QM lahiri -junker , ain,new , bender -ddt .

When being written in the fermion number representation the
one-dimensional  SUSY QM  assembles a pair of
isospectral Hamiltonians
 and  into the matrix Schrodinger operator,
a Super-Hamiltonian,
H = ( ) =( ) -^2 I  + V (x) , suham 
where .
The isospectral connection between
components of the Super-Hamiltonian is provided by  intertwining
relations with the help of Crum-Darboux
(see matveev  and references therein) differential  operators  ,
h^+ q^+ = q^+ h^- , q^- h^+ = h^- q^- , intertw 
which, in the framework of SUSY QM,  are components of the supercharges,
Q=( ),Q=( ),Q^2 = Q^2 = 0. such 
The isospectral shift intertw  entails the
conservation of supercharges or the supersymmetry of the Super-Hamiltonian,
[H,Q] = [H,Q] =0, cons 
which represents the basis of the SUSY algebra.
However its algebraic closure
is given, in general, by  a non-linear SUSY relation,
Q,Q = P  (H), poly 
where  is a function of the Super-Hamiltonian.
In this extended form the Polynomial (or
Higher-derivative)
 SUSY algebra was systematically
introduced(In a different context certain
higher derivative SUSY charges can be also associated with higher-order
Darboux-Crum transformations matveev .)  in ais,acdi :
its supercharges were realized by certain
-th order differential operators,
q^ _N =_k=0 ^N w^ _k (x)^k, w^ _N = const
(1)^N.
superch 
The coefficient functions  are,
in general,  complex and sufficiently smooth. If they are real
then from the
hermiticity of the Hamiltonians and from Eqs. intertw  it follows that,
 with the notations:
 for
the Hermitian conjugation and  for transposition.
But in the complex case the four types of SUSY algebra can be introduced,
based on four intertwining operators and, respectively, four supercharges,
&&q^- = (q^+)^,Q = Q^,&&q^-_c = (q^+)^t,Q_c = Q^t,&&q^+_c = (q^-)^t = (q^+)^*,Q_c = Q^*, htsym 
where  obviously stands for the complex conjugation of
coefficient functions.
These algebras are generated by the pairs:
&&A _1 = (Q, Q),A _ 2 =(Q_c, Q),&&A _3 =(Q, Q_c),A _4 = (Q_c, Q_c).4susy 
These sets are
eventually united in the complex, nonlinear 
supersymmetry (see Sec. 5).

Recently the Polynomial (or Higher-derivative)
SUSY algebra has attracted much interest bags -fermun 
 being a natural algebraic realization of the ladder abi,sukum 
or dressing chain shab,adler  algorithms.
It was rediscovered
under the name of Nonlinear SUSY klip2,ply,klip  and of -fold SUSY
akosw,asty,ast,ast2,anst,tan .
Perhaps the label of Nonlinear SUSY (which we adopt further on)
serves better to reflect its essence
as one
could easily produce non-polynomial examples by means of limiting procedure
applied to a Polynomial SUSY algebra when supercharges would become
pseudo-differential operators or by considering SUSY algebras
with complex-valued supercharges (Sec. 3 and 5).

Meantime it was claimed in ast2,tan  that
there exists a -fold SUSY which generalizes the Polynomial SUSY
in a non-trivial way. To be precise the theorem formulated and proven in
ast2  states the following.


Aoyama-Sato-Tanaka (AST) theorem 

Let  
be two sets of  linearly independent functions,  zero-modes of the
supercharge
components superch ,
 
Then the following propositions hold(The first proposition is a
necessary condition for the Hamiltonian system to be quasi-exactly solvable
 tur,shi  and it was investigated recently
zhdan,fush,doeb  within the notion of "conditional symmetry". ) 

1) The Hamiltonians  have  finite matrix representations
when acting on the set of functions ,
 

2) With the help of the 
matrices , the SUSY algebra closure(The
"Mother Hamiltonian" in the terminology of
ast,ast2 )  takes the general form(It is just an algebra of  type with
.) ,
 
where
Q =( ) , M ^ _N (E)EI - S ^ ,
matrM 
and  are differential operators of  lower orders

generating at least one more SUSY algebra (intertwining relations) for
the same  Super-Hamiltonian , Eq. suham ,

with supercharges,
 

3) In the case of non-vanishing   the SUSY algebra ASTrep 
coexists at least with one Polynomial SUSY of lower order 
.

4) If for given
 the -fold supercharges are uniquely  determined then
   must be zero and the superalgebra closure
leads to the Polynomial SUSY of order ,
  
 

Certainly the AST theorem is helpful to make links to quasi-exact solvability
of particular quantum Hamiltonians sasaki . However it
does not explain the origin of generators
of "small" supersymmetries .
It does not elucidate also the relationship
between them and between the matrices
 and .
As well it does not give a hint on what is the
maximal order of a coexisting Polynomial SUSY and how many supercharges may
commute with a given Super-Hamiltonian. From ASTrep 
it is evident that the operators   and
 are related to
conserved symmetries of the Hamiltonians . However neither genuine
hermitian symmetry generators nor the very meaning of such symmetries have
not been obtained in the framework of the AST theorem.


The main aim of the present work is to clarify the above mentioned,
missing points and
furthermore to prove the following.
 
For a given pair of isospectral systems
intertwined by differential operators of order 
there is always a choice of certain
intertwining operators with real coefficients
(not necessarily unique) which lead to
supercharges of a Polynomial SUSY of the same order .
Thereby the -fold SUSY of ast,ast2 
 for a given
quantum system always  coexists with a Polynomial SUSY of the same order
(and possibly few other polynomial SUSY of different orders).
The complex extension of Nonlinear  SUSY
may bring a SUSY algebra different from a polynomial one just containing
non-trivial symmetry operators. These differential operators of odd order  can
be replaced by non-polynomial functions of a Super-Hamiltonian being defined in the
Hilbert space spanned on eigenfunctions of the Super-Hamiltonian. Thus for the same
Super-Hamiltonian one can simultaneously introduce the nonlinear SUSY in both a
polynomial and a non-polynomial form. In particular it
covers the propositions of the AST theorem.
Among the (infinite) variety of supercharges of type  (or of type 
) commuting with a given
Super-Hamiltonian one can systematically find the optimal set of (no more than)
two basic SUSY
generators  
which are differential operators of even and odd order with
real coefficients. Respectively
all other supercharges of type  (or of type 
) represent linear combinations of  basic
supercharge(s) with coefficient(s) polynomial in the Super-Hamiltonian.
For two essentially independent supercharges a dynamical  symmetry 
for the Super-Hamiltonian arises and the related symmetry 
operator is
unique up to a multiplier polynomial in the Super-Hamiltonian.
There is
a more efficient formulation of the AST theorem
which manifestly  uses the emerging
 dynamical symmetry for a Super-Hamiltonian with two supercharges
and uniquely specifies the relationship between ,
 and  and between the matrices
 and .
For isospectral systems with two independent
supercharges the notion of irreducibility for Polynomial SUSY
formulated in acdi  does not characterize firmly potentials and
the same system may be well described by a more reducible and less reducible
SUSY algebra.

All theorems and constructions are exemplified by means of an exactly solvable
system of second order.

Superalgebras with transposition symmetry 
*2ex  The superalgebras with real coefficient functions in the
differential representation of supercharges as well as the 
complex superalgebras have the transposition symmetry, .
The following theorem is valid for these superalgebras (compare with the
AST theorem).


Theorem on SUSY algebras with T-symmetry 

Let us again introduce two sets of  linearly independent functions


  which represent complete sets of zero-modes
of the supercharge components superch ,
 
Then:

1) the Hamiltonians  have finite matrix representations
when acting on the set of functions ,
 

2) the SUSY algebra closure with 
takes the polynomial form,
 
irrespectively on whether the supercharge of order  is unique or there exist
several supercharges for a given Super-Hamiltonian . 

We stress that the matrix  is the same as in the AST theorem,

whereas the matrix  is different(From
the definitions zerom  and tmode  it follows that the spectra of
two matrices  and 
are mutually complex conjugated.)  from  
due to Eq. tmode .

The proof  of the first statement of the theorem is analogous to that one
of the AST theorem. Namely, one has to act by the operator intertwining
relations intertw  on the zero-mode functions ,
 
and conclude therefrom that  is also a
zero-mode solution, i.e. can be expressed as a linear
combination quasiham1   of a complete set of
.

The proof  of the second part of this theorem is based
on the properties assembled into the
lemma.


Lemma 

Let  be two sets of eigenvalues of matrices
 as being introduced in the above formulated theorem.
Then there exist two sets of first-order differential
operators   such that:

1) they have the canonical form,
r^_l = + ^ _l(x),
l = 1,...,N, factop 
where the functions   may
be complex and/or singular at some points;

2) the factorizations hold,
q^+_N = r^+_1 r^+_N,q^-_N = r^-_1 r^-_N; fact 
3) the chain relations take place,
(r^_l)^tr^_l  + ^_l& =&  r^_l+1 (r^_l+1 )^t +
^_l+1  h^_l,l = 1,,N-1 (r^_N )^t r^_N  + ^_N & =& h^h^_N,r^_1 (r^_1)^t  + ^_1& =&  h^h^_0,
chain 
4) the intermediate Hamiltonian operators have the Schrodinger
form,
 h^_l = - ^2 + v^_l (x); v^_l (x) =
(^_l(x))^2 (^_l(x))' + ^_l=
(^_l+1 (x))^2 (^_l+1 (x))' + ^_l+1 ,
but, in general, with complex and/or singular potentials;

5) the intertwining relations are valid,
h^_l-1  r^_l =  r^_lh^_l ,(r^_l)^th^_l-1  =
h^_l  (r^_l)^t. chaint 
 

The proof  of this lemma is based on the quasi-diagonalization
of matrices ,
i.e on their reduction to the Jordan canonical form  
which is block-diagonal and contains
the Jordan cells with eigenvalues on the main diagonal and unities on the upper subdiagonal.
This diagonalization can be realized by nondegenerate linear
transformations  of the zero-mode sets
which induce the similarity transformations of matrices ,
^_l &=& _m=1 ^N ^_lm  ^_m,h^^_l =  _m=1 ^N S ^ _lm 
^_m,S ^ 
&=&  ^S ^(^)^-1 . jord 
Certainly it is  sufficient to
elaborate the factorization of the operator .
The last line in the matrix  contains the Hamiltonian
eigenvalue ,
h^+ ^-_N = ^+_N ^-_N. hameig 
Next we define,
r^-_N ^-_N = 0, ^-_N - (^-_N)' ^-_N . mode1 
From Eq. hameig  it follows that
h^+ h^+_N  = (r^-_N)^tr^-_N + ^+_N.
Furthermore, the intermediate Schrodinger-like Hamiltonian can be introduced,
h^+_N-1  =  r^-_N (r^-_N)^t + ^+_N = - ^2 + (^-_N)^2 +
(^-_N)' +
^+_N,
which is obviously involved in the intertwining relations with ,
h^+_N-1  r^-_N =  r^-_N h^+_N ,(r^-_N)^t h^+_N-1  =
h^+_N (r^-_N)^t.
The combination of Eq. tmode  and Eq. mode1  yields the
factorization,
q^-_N = q^-_N-1  r^-_N.
Indeed if tmode  and mode1  are valid then in superch 
 w^- _0 (x) = _k=1 ^N  w^- _k (x) _k (x),_k (x) (^-_N)^k-1 
^-_N,
wminus 
where we have introduced the notation 
for the derivative of coefficient
functions  to make a clear distinction from the differential
operator .
Therefore
q^- _N =_k=1 ^N w^- _k (x)(^k +
(- ^-_N)^k-1  ^-_N).
Respectively the factorization
is realized in each component,
(^k +
(- ^-_N)^k-1  ^-_N) = [^k-1   -
_m=0 ^k-2 ^k-m-2   _m+1   ](+
^-_N).
Now it is straightforward to show that:

1) the intertwining relation holds,
h^- q^-_N-1  = q^-_N-1 h^+_N-1 ,
2) the functions,
_n^- = r^-_N ^-_n, 1 n N - 1,
form the complete, linearly independent set of solutions of the equation
;

3) the matrix  which is uniquely
determined from relations,
 h^+_N-1  _n^- = ^N-1 _m=1 
(S ^+_N-1 )_nm  _m^-,
in fact, is derived from 
after deleting of the last column and the
last line: thereby the matrix
 still has
the Jordan canonical form and its spectrum consists of
.

The first two statements are direct consequences of the basic relations
intertw  and tmode  respectively, whereas the third one can be
obtained when acting by the operator  on the definition
jord  of the matrix .

Thus we have reduced the factorization problem of order  to the
latter one of order  having
proved the statements of the lemma on this step. Evidently one can proceed
recursively further on and prove completely the lemma by induction.


In turn, the proof  of the above formulated Theorem uses
the factorization and intertwining relations provided by the Lemma,
q^+_N q^-_N &=& (r^-_N)^t (r^-_1)^tr^-_1 r^-_N =
(r^-_N)^t
(r^-_2 )^t (h^+_1  - ^+_1) r^-_2  r^-_N&=&  (r^-_N)^t (r^-_2 )^t r^-_2   r^-_N
(h^+  - ^+_1)
= =  (h^+ - ^+_1)(h^+ - ^+_N)
&=& det  [EI -S ^+ ]_E = h^+ ;q^-_N q^+_N &=& r^-_1 r^-_N (r^-_N)^t (r^-_1)^t =
r^-_1 r^-_N-1  (h^+_N-1  - ^+_N) (r^-_N-1 )^t (r^-_1)^t

&=& =  (h^- - ^+_1)(h^- - ^+_N)
= det  [EI -S ^+ ]_E = h^- .
trsusy 
The same relation can be derived for the factorization of the operator
 into a product of  using the Jordan form for the matrix
. It leads to the equivalent representation
of the polynomial algebra,
q^_Nq^_N = (h^- ^-_1)(h^-
^-_N)= det  [EI -S ^- ]_E = h^ .
trsusy1 
As the relations trsusy  and trsusy1  are operator ones they hold
for any values of
spectral parameter . Therefore the
eigenvalues of matrices  and  and their corresponding
degeneracies
coincide.


In general, the eigenvalues  of matrices  are complex. For real components of supercharges , the complex
eigenvalues obviously appear in complex conjugated pairs providing the real polynomial   but for complex
supercharge components  the resulting polynomial contains
complex coefficients. In next sections we examine the non-uniqueness
of a complex supercharge describing a given hermitian Super-Hamiltonian.

Several supercharges and Extended SUSY 
*2ex   The non-uniqueness of supercharges
was  mentioned for the first time( See the related
Section in the E-archive version of comalg  as it was eliminated from
the final journal paper under the severe pressure of a referee.)  in
comalg .
It was observed that for a hermitian Super-Hamiltonian  the conserved
supercharges  with complex intertwining
components  always generate
two SUSY algebras: one for their "real" parts   and another one
for their "imaginary" parts 
where the corresponding labels are referred
to the real and imaginary parts of
coefficients
in the differential intertwining operators
,
Q = K + i P ;  [H, Q] =  [H, K] = [H, P] =
[H, Q] = [H, K] = [H, P]
= 0. extsusy 
Evidently the conjugated operators can be defined uniquely,
, independently on
what a choice is taken from 4susy  for the operators .
One can always employ the normalization superch  of the senior derivative
in  on a real constant. Then the second supercharge  appears to be
a differential operator of lower order .

The appearance of the second supercharge conventionally implies the
extension of SUSY algebra. To close the algebra one has to include
all anticommutators between supercharges, i.e. 
the full algebra based on two supercharges  and 
with real intertwining operators. Two supercharges generate
two Polynomial SUSY,
K, K^ = P _N (H),P, P^ = P _N_1  (H). 2alg 
This SUSY algebra has to be embedded into a
 SUSY(There is a misinterpretation concerning the
classification of extended SUSY in QM. The conventional 
SUSY deals with non-hermitian nilpotent  supercharges  whereas
the  SUSY should employ two pairs of nilpotent supercharges
 satisfying the extended SUSY algebra
with certain central charges.
We are grateful to A. Smilga for the discussion of this point. However
there are papers (see discussion in lima )
where the SUSY QM algebra is defined as  SUSY
in terms of hermitian supercharges .
We would like to stress that an elementary SUSY charge is nilpotent 
carrying fermion quantum numbers. Moreover a nontrivial dynamics cannot be
obtained with one real SUSY charge (as it was recently
mentioned in lima ).) .
The closure of the extended,  SUSY algebra is given by
P, K^ & & R 
= ( ),K, P^ && R 
= ( ). roper 
Evidently the
components of operators 
are differential
operators of  order commuting with the Hamiltonians , 
hence they form symmetry operators   for the Super-Hamiltonian.
 However, in general, they are not
polynomials of the Hamiltonians  and these symmetries impose certain
constraints on potentials(Such type of symmetries in
one-dimensional QM
 and their possible relation to the Lax method in the soliton theory
was discussed in
matveev,zhdan .) .

All four operators

commute each to other. Moreover the hermitian matrix describing this
  SUSY,
Z  (H) = ( ), det  [Z  (H)] =
 P _N P _N_1  -  R  R  = 0, centr 
is degenerate. Therefore it seems that the two supercharges are not
independent and by their redefinition
(unitary rotation) one might reduce the extended SUSY to an ordinary
 one. However such rotations cannot be global and must
use non-polynomial, pseudo-differential operators as "parameters".
Indeed, the operator components of the "central charge" matrix 
have different order in derivatives. Thus, globally the extended nonlinear
SUSY
deals with two sets of supercharges but when they act on
a given eigenfunction of the
Super-Hamiltonian  one could, in principle, perform the energy-dependent
rotation and
eliminate a pair of supercharges. Nevertheless this reduction can be
possible only after the constraints on potentials have been resolved.

Let us find the formal relation between
the symmetry operators  and the Super-Hamiltonian.
These operators can be decomposed into a hermitian and an antihermitian
parts,
B 12(R  +R ) (  ),i E  12 (R  - R )i (  ). herm 
The
operator  is a differential operator of even order and therefore
it may be a polynomial of the Super-Hamiltonian . But if the
operator  does not vanish identically
it is a differential operator of odd  order and
 cannot be realized by a polynomial of .

The first operator
plays essential role in the one-parameter
non-uniqueness of the SUSY algebra.
Indeed, one can always redefine  the higher-order supercharge as
follows,
 K^()  =  K + P,  K^() , K^()  =
P ^() _N (H), redef 
keeping the same order  of Polynomial SUSY for arbitrary real
parameter . From redef  one gets,
2 B  (H) =
P ^() _N (H) -P _N (H) - ^2
 P _N_1  (H),
thereby the hermitian operator  is a
polynomial of the Super-Hamiltonian of the order .
Let's use it to unravel the Super-Hamiltonian content of the operator ,
E ^2 (H) = P _N (H)
P _N_1  (H) - B ^2 (H), secsym 
which follows directly from centr  and herm . As
the (nontrivial) operator 
is a differential operator of odd order  it may have only a
realization non-polynomial in  being a square root of secsym  in
an operator sense. This operator is certainly non-trivial if the sum of orders
 of the operators  and  is odd and therefore
. For an even sum  we cannot in general
make any definite conclusion concerning the non-triviality
of  . However  it will be shown in Sec. 7 that if the symmetry
operator is non-zero then
for any choice of the operators  and  an optimal set of
independent supercharges (possibly of lower orders)
can be obtained which is
characterized by an odd sum of their orders.

The existence of a
nontrivial symmetry operator  commuting with the
Super-Hamiltonian results in common eigenstates which however are not necessarily
physical wave functions. In general they may be combinations of two solutions
of the Shrodinger equation with a given energy, the physical and
unphysical ones. But if  the
symmetry operator   is
hermitian in respect to the scalar product of the
Hilbert space spanned on the eigenfunctions of the Super-Hamiltonian  then
both operators have a common set of physical wave functions. This fact imposes quite rigid
conditions on  potentials.

In particular,
for
intertwining operators with sufficiently smooth coefficient functions having
constant asymptotics at large coordinates the
symmetry operator   has the similar properties and is evidently
hermitian. In this case one has  non-singular
potentials with constant asymptotics at large  and therefore
a continuum energy spectrum  of 
with wave functions satisfying the scattering conditions.
Thus the incoming and outgoing states,  and ,
at large  are conventionally represented by  combinations of plane waves
which are solutions of the Schrodinger equation for a free particle,
&&(x)_x -  (ik_in x) + R(k_in )(-ik_in x),&&(x)_x +  (1 + T(k_out ))(ik_out x),
where the reflection, , and transmission, , coefficients
are introduced. Since the symmetry  is described by a differential operator
of odd order  which at large  tends to an antisymmetric
operator with constant
coefficients the eigenstates of this operator at large coordinates
approach to individual plane waves
 with opposite eigenvalues 
and cannot be their combinations. Hence the eigenstate of the
Super-Hamiltonian with a given value of the operator  may characterize
only the transmission and cannot have any reflection, .
We conclude that the corresponding potentials 
in suham  inevitably belong to the
class of transparent or reflectionless ones refl .

As the
symmetry operator   is
hermitian its eigenvalues are real but, by construction,
its coefficients are purely imaginary. Since the
wave functions of bound
states of the system  can be always chosen real we conclude that they
must be zero-modes of the operator ,
E  (H) _i = E  (E_i) _i = 0,  P _N (E_i)P _N_1  (E_i) - B ^2 (E_i) = 0,
zeroeq 
which represents the algebraic equation on bound state
energies of a system possessing two supersymmetries. Among solutions
of zeroeq  one reveals
also a zero-energy state at the bottom of
continuum spectrum. On the other hand
one could find also the solutions which are not
associated to any bound state. The very
appearance of such unphysical solutions is
accounted for by the trivial possibility to replicate supercharges by their
multiplication on the polynomials of the Super-Hamiltonian and it is discussed
in Sec. 6.

Example:  
*2ex  Let us examine the algebraic structure of the simplest non-linear SUSY
with two supercharges,
k^&& ^2 2f(x)+ b(x) f'(x) ; p^&& + (x), exgen 
induced by the complex supercharge
of second order in derivatives comalg .
The supersymmetries extsusy 
generated by  and  prescribe that
V_1,2  &=& ^2 =
2f' + f^2 + f" 2f  - (f' 2f )^2 -
d 4f^2  -a,b &=& f^2 - f" 2f  +(f' 2f )^2 +
d 4f^2 ,
where  are real functions and  are real constants.
The related superalgebra closure for  and 
takes the form,
K, K = (H + a)^2 + d,P, P = H,
secor 
the latter one clarifies the role of constants .

The compatibility of two supersymmetries is achieved on solutions
of the following equations
= 2 f + _0,f^2 + f" 2f  -
(f' 2f )^2 - d 4f^2  -a = ^2 =
 (2 f + _0)^2, 2equ 
where  is an arbitrary real constant.
The latter one represents a nonlinear second-order differential equation
which solutions are parameterized by two integration constants. Therefore
as it was advertised the existence of two SUSY constrains substantially
the class of potentials for which they may hold.

Let us use the freedom to redefine the higher-order supercharge redef 
for eliminating the constant  in 2equ . After this
simplification
the equation 2equ  is  integrated into the following, first-order one,
= 2 f;(f')^2 = 4 f^4 + 4 a f^2 + 4 G_0 f - d _4(f),
firstor 
where  is a real constant.

The solutions of this equation are elliptic functions which
 can be easily found in the implicit form,
^f(x) _f_0  df _4(f)   = (x - x_0),
where the lower limit of integration  and  are real constants.

It can be shown that they may be nonsingular in three situations.

a) The polynomial  has four different real roots  and
 is chosen between two roots  and .
The corresponding potentials are periodic. This case will not be
examined here.

b)   has three different real roots and the double root

is either the maximal one or a minimal one,
 _4(f) = 4 (f -  2 )^2
((f +  2 )^2 - (^2 -
)), 0 < < ^2. polyn 
Then there exits a relation
between constants  in terms of
coefficients ,
a = - 3 ^22  < 0,G_0 = (^2 - ),
d = ^2  (3 ^24  - ) .
defa 
Besides the constant  is
taken between the double root and a nearest simple root.

c)   has two different real double roots which corresponds
in polyn , defa  to

. The constant  is
taken between the roots.

The corresponding potentials  are well known refl  and in the
cases b) and c) are
reflectionless, with one bound state at the energy 
 and
with the continuum spectrum starting from .
Respectively the scattering wave function is proportional to 
with .

In particular, in the case b) the potentials coincide in their form
and differ only  by shift in the coordinate,

x^(1,2) _0)) ,x^(1,2)  =x_0 1 4  
-   +   ,
caseb 
and  in the case c) one of the potentials can be chosen constant,
V_1 = ^2,V_2 =  ^2 (1 -
2 ch ^2 ((x - x_0)) ),
casec 
For these potentials one can illustrate
all the relations of extended SUSY algebra.

The initial algebra is given by the
relations secor . The first, polynomial
symmetry operator turns out to be constant, 
when taking into account exgen  and firstor . The second
symmetry operator reads,
E  (H) = i[I ^3 - (a I  + 
32 V (x)) 
- 34 V ' (x)],
oddrep 
in terms of the potential suham . From the identity secsym  or
directly from Eq. oddrep 
one derives with the help of Eqs. firstor  and defa  that,
E ^2 (H) = H [ (H + a)^2 + d]
 -  G_0^2  =  (H - E_b)^2 (H -  ^2),quadr 
where  is the energy of a bound state.
Thus (some of) the zero modes of  characterize either bound states or
zero-energy states in the continuum. However there exist also the 
non-normalizable, unphysical zero-modes corresponding to . 
We remark that in the case c)
only the Hamiltonian  has a bound state. Hence the physical 
zero modes of
  may be either degenerate (case b), broken SUSY) or (one
of them) non-degenerate (case c), unbroken SUSY).

The square root in quadr  can be carried out,
E  (H) =  (H - E_b) H -  ^2 .root 
We notice that the symmetry operator oddrep , root  is irreducible, i.e. 
 the binomial  cannot be "stripped off"
(the exact meaning of this operation see in Sec. 6). Indeed the
elimination of this binomial would lead to an essentially nonlocal
operator. The sign of square root in root 
is fixed from the conventional asymptotics
of scattering wave functions
 and the asymptotics 
by comparison of this relation with Eq. oddrep .

When taking Eq. root  into account one finds the non-polynomial relations
of the extended  SUSY algebra,
 K, P^ = K^, P^=
G_0 - i (H - E_b) H -  ^2 . nonpol 
The hermitian matrix , Eq. centr  is built of the elements
secor  and nonpol  and evidently cannot be diagonalized by a unitary
rotation with elements polynomial in . Thus the algebra must be
considered to be extended in the class of
differential operators of finite order.

It remains to clarify the very non-uniqueness of the
higher-order supercharge, namely, its role in the classification of the
Polynomial SUSY. For arbitrary  in redef  one obtains
&&K^() , K^()  = H^2 + (2a + ^2) H + a^2 + d
+ 2 G_0 = (H + a_)^2  + d_,&& a_= a + 12 ^2,d_= d + 2 G_0 - a ^2 - 14 ^4
- _4 (-  2 ),
where  is defined in Eq. firstor .

One can see that the sign of , in general, depends on the choice of .  For instance, let us consider the case b) when
d_= - 14 (+ )^2
[ (- )^2 - 4 (^2 -)].
dlam 
Evidently if  lies in between the real
roots of the last factor in dlam 
then  is positive and otherwise it is negative. But two real roots
always exist because .
Thereby the sign of 
can be freely negative or positive without
any change in the Hamiltonians. Hence  in the case when
the Polynomial SUSY is an extended one,
with two sets of supercharges, the irreducibility or
reducibility of a Polynomial SUSY algebra does not signify any
invariant characteristic of potentials.

Complex SUSY algebras 
*2ex If the intertwining
operators  have complex coefficients in
superch  then  we deal with two supercharges which we
adopt to be independent (see Sec. 7 for its exact definition).
One can split again the
complex supercharge  into a real,  and an imaginary,  counterparts
as in Eq. extsusy  and normalize them so that the intertwining operator
in  has a higher order in derivatives. Two SUSY algebras
with transposition symmetry,
 and , are polynomial in virtue of the Theorem
of Sec. 2. In terms of real supercharges they have the following structure,
&&Q, Q_c =  P _N (H)
- P _N_1  (H) + i 2B  (H),2susy1 

&&Q_c, Q =  P _N (H)
- P _N_1  (H) -i 2 B  (H), 2susy2 

&&Q_c = Q^t =
K^+ i P^;Q_c = Q^* =
K - i P;Q =
K^- i P^. 2def 
Two more algebras,  and  can be built
with a hermitian closure according to Eq. 4susy . In particular,
the algebra   (used in the
AST theorem, Sec. 1) is completed by the following closure,
Q, Q =  P _N (H)
+ P _N_1  (H) - 2E  (H). 2susy3 
Respectively the algebra  is completed by the relation,
Q_c, Q_c =  P _N (H)
+ P _N_1  (H)  + 2E  (H). 2susy4 
When the symmetry operator  is nontrivial
they are essentially non-polynomial (see secsym ).

We conclude that for complex intertwining operators
the same pair of isospectral Hamiltonians may be induced
both by the polynomial SUSY algebra 2alg  (or
2susy1 , 2susy2 ) and by the non-polynomial one
2susy3 , 2susy4 .

All four superalgebras  generated by

can be assembled into the extended  SUSY
algebra,
Q_i, Q_j = [(I + _1) P _N (H)
+
(I - _1) P _N_1  (H) - _2 2B  (H)
- _3 2 E  (H)]_ij ,
with . It is equivalent, of course,
to the algebra 2alg  and roper .

Let us illustrate such an algebra using the   example of
Sec. 4. Thus the intertwining operator  is composed from
the operators exgen  where the constant  of mass dimension
is introduced from dimensional reasons. Respectively,
Q_i, Q_j &=& [(I + _1) ((H + a)^2 + d )
+(I - _1) c^2 H. &&. - _2 2c G_0 -
_3 2c (H - E_b) H -  ^2 ]_ij ,
i.e. is manifestly non-polynomial in respect to the Super-Hamiltonian .

It remains to clarify the relationship between the hermitian algebra
  determined in the AST theorem by Eq. ASTrep 
and that one given by 2susy3 . For this purpose
we relate the representation ASTrep 
to the algebra with transposition symmetry,
Eq. tposusy . In order to establish the exact correspondence
the upper and lower components in the matrix  have to
be treated differently.
Namely for the upper component  the suitable decomposition,
, yields,
q^+_N q^-_N =(q^-_N)^t q^-_N +  2i p^+_N_1 q^-_N =
det  [EI -S ^+ ]_E = h^+  +  2i p^+_N_1 q^-_N,
ASTrec1 
where from one reproduces the upper component of Eq. ASTrep  after
the identification . We stress that the matrix
 does not coincide with  from
Eq. quasiham1  because in ASTrec1  
. But in appropriate bases of mutually complex conjugated
functions
they may be related by complex conjugation, 
.

Similarly the lower component can be transformed into the form ASTrep 
by means of the decomposition,  and reads,
q^-_N q^+_N =(q^+_N)^t q^+_N -  2i p^-_N_1 q^+_N =
det  [EI - S ^- ]_E = h^-  -  2i p^-_N_1 q^+_N,
ASTrec2 
where from one obtains the lower component of Eq. ASTrep  after
the identification .
The matrix 
is exactly as 
in the Theorem on SUSY algebras with T-symmetry,
Eq. quasiham1 .

The AST decomposition ASTrec1 , ASTrec2  is certainly equivalent
to the representation 2susy3  but supplies both the polynomial part
and the non-polynomial symmetry operator with  imaginary contributions  which
eventually assemble into  . Thereby the hermitian
symmetry operator  non-polynomial in  is hidden in
Eqs. ASTrec1 , ASTrec2 .  This is why we give our favor to the
representation 2susy3  in the analysis of supersymmetries with several
supercharges.

"Strip-off" problem 
*2ex  The pair of two
supersymmetries analyzed in Sec. 3 and 5
may  rigidly determine the class of potentials 
in suham   to a specific, transparent type of them
contracting the freedom in their
choice from a functional one to a parametric one.  On the other hand,
there exists a trivial possibility when the intertwining operators
 and
 are related by a factor depending on
the Hamiltonian,
k^_N =
F (h^) p^_N_1 
=  p^_N_1   F (h^), triv 
where
 is assumed to be a polynomial. Obviously in
this case
the symmetry operator  identically vanishes and the appearance
of the second supercharge does not result in any restrictions on potentials.

More generally the orders of  polynomial superalgebras and some of
the roots of
associated polynomials may not be involved in determination of
the structure of the potentials.
In particular, let the operators  and
  be reducible
to some lower-order ones  and
,
k^_N =
F_k (h^) k^_N 
=  k^_N   F_k (h^), p^_N_1  =   F_p (h^) p^_N_1 
=  p^_N_1  F_p (h^), triv1 
where the numbers in the pairs  and 
are simultaneously
odd or even and
 are  polynomials of order
 and .
Then evidently the superalgebra generated by
  and
 equally well characterizes the Super-Hamiltonian system
with the same potentials.


We have come to the problem of how to discern the nontrivial part of a
supercharge and avoid multiple SUSY algebras generated by means of "dressing"
triv1 . It can be systematically performed with the help of the
following theorem.




"Strip-off" Theorem  

Let's admit the
construction of the Theorem on SUSY algebras with T-symmetry. Then the
requirement

that
the matrix  (or ) generated on the
subspace of zero-modes of the operator  (or )
contains  pairs (and no more) of Jordan
cells with equal
eigenvalues  
and the sizes  of a smallest cell in the -th pair

is necessary and sufficient to ensure for
the intertwining operator  (or ) to be represented in the
factorized form:
k^_N  = k^_N  ^n_l=1  (_l - h^)^_l , factor 
where 
are intertwining operators(In this theorem the
intertwining operators  and the parameters
 may also be complex.) 
of order 
which cannot be  decomposed
further on in the product similar to triv1  with . 

We shall perform the proof  of the theorem for
 only as its proof for  is similar.
It is based on the lemma and two remarks.


Remark 1.  The matrices   cannot contain more
than two Jordan cells with the same eigenvalue  because otherwise the
operator  would have more than two linearly independent
zero-modes (not necessarily normalizable).


Lemma. 

In order that the intertwining operator  could be factorized,
k^+_N = k^+_N-2  (- h^-), factor2 
with   being another intertwining operator of order ,
it is necessary and sufficient for the matrix
 to contain two Jordan cells with the same eigenvalue
. 


Proof .3ex  The requirement of this Lemma is
sufficient because if   contains
two Jordan cells with the same eigenvalue  then the kernel of 
includes two linearly independent solutions of the equation
.  When repeating the way of proof of the Theorem
on SUSY algebras with T-symmetry one can derive that  is factorized
in the form,
k^+_N = k^+_N-2  (- _2(x))(- _1(x)),
where    is a differential operator of order  and the functions
 and  are chosen to provide the equal kernels of
operators  and .
As a differential operator of second order with the unit coefficient at
 is uniquely determined by two linearly independent elements
of its kernel one concludes that
- h^- = (- _2)(- _1),
and therefore factor2  is valid. At last, from the relations,
k^+_N-2  h^-(- h^-) = k^+_N h^- = h^+ k^+_N =  h^+ k^+_N-2 (- h^-),
one obtains that the operator  is intertwining.

The condition factor2  is also necessary as in this case the
kernel of  includes two linearly independent solutions of the
equation  which induce two
different Jordan cells with the same eigenvalue.


Remark 2.  Within the Lemma let us put
the lower lines of two Jordan cells with
the eigenvalue  into the -th and -th line () of
 respectively and introduce the functions,
^+_l(x) = .
where the functions  form the basis of the kernel of
the operator   which supply the matrix  with
the Jordan form.
Evidently the functions  are linearly independent because
in the opposite case a nontrivial linear combination of


 must be a combination of
zero-modes  and . Thus they
form the complete set of solutions of the equation 
which
comes from factor2 . The matrix  which
describes the Hamiltonian action on the zero-mode subspace
 of the intertwining operator ,
can be produced from the matrix  by
deleting both the -th and -th columns and lines. Thereby it has a
Jordan form.



Now from the Lemma and the Remarks 1 and 2 one derives all
statements of the "Strip-off" Theorem.

This theorem naturally supplements the Theorem on SUSY algebras with
T-symmetry as it entails the essential identity of the Jordan forms
  and   (up to transposition of
certain Jordan cells).

Let us  illustrate the  Theorem by the Example: 
the matrix  for the intertwining operator 
with Jordan cells of different size having
the same eigenvalue. It is generated by the operators,
p^= + ,h^=p^p^+ ,k^+_3 = - p^+ p^- p^+ =p^+ (- h^-).
Respectively:
 
Thus,
S ^- =( ).
As a consequence of the "Strip-off" Theorem one finds that
the supercharge components cannot be factorized
in the form triv1 
if the polynomial  in the SUSY algebra closure 2alg 
does not reveal the degenerate zeroes. Indeed the SUSY algebra closure
contains the square of polynomial , for instance,
k^-_N k^+_N = F_k (h^-) k^-_N  k^+_N   F(h^-)
=  F_k^2 (h^-) P _N  (h^-),
dzero 
where  is a polynomial of
lower order, .
Therefore each zero of the polynomial  will produce a double zero
in the SUSY algebra provided by dzero .

Thus the absence of double zeroes
is sufficient to deal with the SUSY charges non-factorizable in the sense
of Eq. triv1 . However it is not necessary because the degenerate zeroes
may well arise in the ladder (dressing chain) construction giving
new pairs of isospectral potentials (see, for instance, acdi  for the
Polynomial SUSY of second order).

Further on we consider only the stripped-off supercharges. In this case
the existence of two intertwining operators results in more equations
on their coefficient functions and thereby on the potentials in .
When they are compatible they rigidly dictate the form of potentials
leaving only the parametric freedom for their choice.

Still the stripped-off supercharges do not necessarily represent an optimal 
set of them and provide an optimal
structure of the symmetry operator .

Let us illustrate it with
the sample intertwining operators 
made of two stripped-off supercharges  with components  and . If
the differential operators  and  have even and odd order
respectively and the operators  are non-zero the operators
 cannot be stripped off till   or  because
the components of symmetry operator 

are surely non-trivial and therefore the operators
 and  are 
not polynomials of the Hamiltonian. One can see it manifestly for the 
supercharges exgen  of the Example in the case b) when .

Meantime the system
composed of two supercharges
with components  and  has
the symmetry realized by the operator
   with components,
e^_t =
i12 (t^p_N_1 ^- p_N_1 ^t^) =
i12 (k_N^p_N_1 ^- p_N_1 ^k_N^)
p_N_1 ^p_N_1 ^= - e^P _N_1  (h^),
where to obtain it
the commutation of the Super-Hamiltonian
with operators ,
Eq. roper  has been used. Thus the symmetry operator  
contains a  polynomial factor
 which zeroes are not in general related to any bound state
energies. The lesson is that the symmetry operator must be stripped-off in
addition to the intertwining operators in order
to avoid unphysical zeroes of the function . In order to perform the minimization of the
symmetry operator one can employ the "Strip-off" Theorem and analyze the
Jordan form of the relevant Hamiltonian projection  on the
zero-mode subspace of the operator . Then the elimination of pairs
of equal eigenvalues from different Jordan cells would essentially reduce the
spectrum of the projected Hamiltonian towards a set of its bound state
energies.

On the other hand the intertwining operators  represent a linear combination of
  and  with coefficients depending on the Hamiltonian,
 t^= 2 b^(h^) p_N_1 ^- P _N_1 (h^)  k_N^.
lincom 
If the polynomials    and  do not have common
roots one may find the intertwining operators   which cannot be
stripped off till a combination of   and  of lower order in
derivatives (see again the case b) in Sec. 4).

However one can easily build the equivalent supercharges
  which can be stripped off
till  . Thus in order to construct the optimal basis of supercharges
one should not only factorize out the polynomials of the Super-Hamiltonian but also
examine their various linear combinations with coefficients polynomial in
the Super-Hamiltonian.

Optimization of supercharges 
*2ex  As it follows from the previous discussion the
existence of several supercharges is controlled by a non-trivial
symmetry operator. If there are several SUSY generators the necessity arises:

a) to introduce the notion of (in)dependence of intertwining operators;b) to find out how many independent supercharges can coexist;c) to define an optimal basis of intertwining operators.

Let us extrapolate the relation lincom  and define the intertwining 
operators
 to be dependent if and only if the
polynomials 
exist such that not all of them are vanishing and
_i=1 ^n _i^(h^)q_i^depen 
If the relation depen  results in  
for all   the corresponding SUSY generators are independent.
Evidently the (in)dependence of  entails  the (in)dependence
of  and vice versa .

The following theorem plays a key role in resolution of how many
independent supercharges can commute with a given Super-Hamiltonian.


Theorem on (in)dependence of supercharges 

Consider two non-trivial intertwining operators  with
transposition symmetry  which in general
may have complex coefficients and let us normalize them in accordance to
superch . Then the stripped-off intertwining operators
 coincide if and only if
the symmetry operator made of   vanishes,
 (or equivalently
). 

The proof  of this theorem is based on the Lemma.



Lemma 

If   (or equivalently
) then the sets of Jordan cells
(and their sizes) in the matrices  and

for the operators  and   are identical. 

To prove its validity  we first remark that evidently the symmetry operator
 
for stripped-off operators   and   also
vanishes in virtue of intertwining relations and because the factor
polynomials for  and  are equal. Therefore the operator
b^+_12  = q^+_1 q^-_2=  q^+_2 q^-_1 =
12 [(q^+_1 +q^+_2)(q^-_1 + q^-_2) -
q^+_1 q^-_1 - q^+_2q^-_2]
is a polynomial of the Hamiltonian  (compare with herm ).
Hence, according to the "Strip-off" Theorem the matrix
 on the basis of zero-modes of the
operator  contains two (and evidently no more) Jordan cells
of the same size for each eigenvalue.

Next, from the Theorems of Sec. 2 and 6 one concludes that the spectrum
of the matrix  joins the spectra of
 and

for the operators  and  . Moreover since
the latter ones are stripped off the related matrices  
include one Jordan cell only for each eigenvalue.

At last, taking into account that 
 one can derive that for each
eigenvalue of   a related  Jordan cell with the same
eigenvalue exists in  and its size is no less
than that one of the Jordan cell in  .

Thus the number and sizes of Jordan cells in matrices
 and  are the same.


As a consequence the orders of differential operators   and
 are the same and they can be combined to form another intertwining
operator of a lower order, .
If   one can strip off and normalize this operator
 then apply the Lemma to the pair
of operators  
which symmetry operator is
again trivial. As a result we prove these operators to
have the same order in the contradiction  with our initial construction
unless the operator  and thereby
. The latter completes the
proof of the Theorem.

As a corollary of the Theorem one finds that for the stripped-off operators
 and   of different order the symmetry
operator .

Two other consequences of the Theorem concern the structure
of symmetry operators and their uniqueness:

a) any symmetric (self-transposed) symmetry operator 
 is a
polynomial of the Hamiltonian, the latter is obtained by substituting a pair of
the operators   and  (unity)  instead of   in the
formulation of the Theorem;

b) any two antisymmetric symmetry operators 
 are dependent, i.e.  being stripped off
coincide, that follows from the Theorem after substituting them  instead
of  .

Now one can answer the question about a maximal number of independent
supercharges and their relative oddness. First let us prove that the
number of supercharges cannot exceed two. Assume that there exist
three independent intertwining operators .
Then their pairwise symmetry operators  
 are antisymmetric and non-trivial but dependent in virtue of the
consequence b),  .
When multiplying these relations on   one can assemble
the following
identity,
&&q^+_1[  _13 (h^-) q^-_2 -  _12 (h^-) q^-_3] -
[q^+_2 _13 (h^-) - q^+_3 _12 (h^-)] q^-_1 = 0
=q^+_1 q^-_23  - q^+_23   q^-_1;&&q^+_2 _13 (h^-) - q^+_3 _12 (h^-) q^+_23 ,
where the operator   is non-trivial due to independence of
 and .
Evidently two intertwining operators  and  
satisfy the requirements of the Theorem
and therefore are dependent in contradiction with the initial assumption.
Thus we have proved that the maximal number of independent supercharges is two.

Next let us consider two normalized independent intertwining 
operators    of orders
 and  such that   and
the sum of their order  is even. Then evidently the operator
q^+_3 =q^+_1 - (- h^+)^N_1 -N_2 2   q^+_2 reduc 
is independent of   and has the order    less than  .
If the sum of orders   is again even one may 
normalize  and apply the above algorithm to derive a lower order independent SUSY generator until the sum of orders
became odd. Thus one can always construct the basis of two
intertwining operators
containing an even and an odd one.

Finally one can search for a set of minimal intertwining operators 
 
just solving
the system for two independent intertwining operators,
q^_i = ^_i (h^) k_N^+ ^_i (h^) p_N_1 ^,
i=1,2 ; decom 
with coefficients   polynomial
in the Hamiltonian.

Indeed,

a) among all intertwining operators 
there exist an unique real operator
of lowest order  normalized according to superch ;

b)  among all intertwining operators  independent of  
there exist a real operator
of lowest order  normalized according to superch ;

c) with the help of the algorithm reduc  one can prove that
one of the operators   and  is of even order
and another one is of odd order;

d) an arbitrary intertwining
operator  is
always decomposed in the form decom  in the unique way
which can be proven by a consequent application of the algorithm reduc 
and taking into account that the one of the
terms   and   is of even order
and another one is of odd order.

Thus the set of   and  form an optimal basis of
intertwining operators. As  all  the same results are 
translated
to the set of   and .
More about symmetry operators 
*2ex  In the previous Section we have proven that the antisymmetric 
symmetry
operator (in each component)
 is unique after being stripped off. But the
optimization of supercharge basis may not guarantee the minimal form of
components of the symmetry operator.
The uniqueness of decomposition decom  allows to formulate a necessary
condition for the symmetry operator  made of the minimal
operators  to be stripped off further on.
Namely if a polynomial  can be
factorized out of the symmetry operator  then the same polynomial
appears as a multiplier in  
. It follows from the relations,
&& i e^k_N^= 12 (k_N^p_N_1 ^-  p_N_1 ^k_N^)k_N^=
b^(h^) k_N^- P _N (h^) p_N_1 ^,&& i e^p_N_1 ^= 12 (k_N^p_N_1 ^-  p_N_1 ^k_N^) p_N_1 ^=
 P _N_1  (h^) k_N^-b^(h^) p_N_1 ^.
One can give a more detailed description of
each component of the symmetry operator
for a particular class of potentials with the help of
the Lemma.


Lemma 

Assume that:

a) the Hamiltonian  commutes with an
antisymmetric real operator  of order  which cannot be
stripped off;b) this Hamiltonian has at least one bound state;c) the wave function  characterizes a bound state with the lowest
energy .

Then there exist a non-singular Hamiltonian , a non-singular
real operator  and a non-singular
antisymmetric real operator  of order   which cannot be
stripped off such that:
&& h_a = r_a^t r_a + E_0;h_b = r_a r^t_a + E_0;r_a h_a = h_b r_a;2ham 

&& R_a = r_a^t R_b r_a;R_b h_b = h_b R_b.2sim 
 

The proof of relations 2ham  is standard for the SUSY QM abi .
The partial factorization of  with a non-singular
differential operator  of order  is provided by the equations
 and .
Evidently it is an intertwining operator,
 due to Eqs. 2ham . As the Hamiltonian 
does not have the level  the latter relation entails
. Hence the factorization takes place
 with a non-singular differential operator
 of order . From the intertwining relations it follows that
the operator  is a symmetry operator. At last its antisymmetry under
transposition can be easily derived from the similar property of  .
The operator  cannot be stripped off if Eqs. 2sim  hold and
the operator    has been stripped off already.

From the Lemma one can obtain a certain relationship
between the number of bound states of the Hamiltonian and the structure of the symmetry operator. Namely,
suppose that
the Hamiltonian  has   bound states with energies 
and
commutes with a antisymmetric real
operator  of order  which cannot be stripped off.  Then
the (normalized) symmetry operator can be factorized,
R_0 = r^t_0r^t_n-1     r_n-1 r_0;r_l + _l, canon 
with non-singular real superpotentials . Respectively the
ladder (dressing chain) relations hold,
&& h_l+1  r_l = r_l h_l;l = 0,n-1;&&h_l r_l-1  r_l-1 ^t + E_l-1  =
r^t_l r_l +E_l;l = 1,n-1;&&h_0 = r^t_0 r_0 + E_0;h_n = r_n-1  r_n-1 ^t + E_n-1 ,
and the hidden symmetry operators arise for each intermediate Hamiltonian,
&&R_l = r^t_lr^t_n-1   r_n-1 r_l;R_n =
;&& R_l h_l = h_l R_l;l = 0,n.
Evidently the Hamiltonian  describes a free particle and therefore
the Hamiltonian system with a hidden symmetry can be related to
the free-particle system.

In the case b) of Sec. 4 each component of the
symmetry operator can be also 
represented in the canonical factorized form canon ,
e^=i[ ^3  - (a +32 V_1,2 )-34 V_1,2 '
] = -i
(- - _1,2 ' _1,2  )(
- _1,2 ' _1,2  ),

with the help
of the bound-state wave functions, .  
In the case c) the potentials casec  exemplify the Lemma as one of them is
constant.

One can guess that the above relationship
between the Hamiltonian  and the symmetry operator  is quite general
because
the algorithm of the Lemma helps to transform the system with  bound states
and with a symmetry operator to  a system with  bound states and
a symmetry operator of order lower in two units. After one removes
all bound states with this algorithm the remaining Hamiltonian is still
reflectionless and thereby the scattering coefficients are
trivial corresponding to a free-particle system.


Concluding remarks 
*2ex We have established that:

a) for supercharges of finite order the Polynomial SUSY can be
always realized when the supercharges are related by transposition;

b) in certain cases (for instance, for complex intertwining operators)
several supercharges may commute with the Super-Hamiltonian which may yield
a non-trivial hidden symmetry of such a system;

c) the maximal number of independent
supercharges of type  (or of type ) 
commuting with a given Super-Hamiltonian is two and
in the case of Extended  superalgebras
there exists an optimal
set of two real supercharges with components of a
 minimal order in derivatives, 
one of which is
an odd-order operator and another one is an even-order operator;

d) for Extended  superalgebras the hidden
symmetry operator  defined in herm 
is unique up to a multiplier polynomial in the Super-Hamiltonian and among
zero-modes of this operator there are all bound
states of the Super-Hamiltonian.

Finally we mention possible extensions of the Theorems and results of this
paper. First of all it seems to be straightforward to apply them to the
Super-Hamiltonians with complex potentials acdicom  as the SUSY algebra with
transposition symmetry is well defined for such Super-Hamiltonians.
The application to
matrix Super-Hamiltonians matrix  is less
trivial but certainly interesting as well as a generalization on
multidimensional QM abi,ain .
