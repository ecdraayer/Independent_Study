Abstract   
Moduli spaces of conformal field theories corresponding 
to current-current deformations are discussed. For WZW models, 
CFT and sigma model considerations are compared. It is shown 
that current-current deformed WZW models have WZW-like sigma model 
descriptions with non-bi-invariant metrics, additional -fields
and a non-trivial dilaton.



Introduction 

Moduli spaces of conformal field theories are important objects
in the study of two dimensional quantum field theories because
they describe critical subspaces in the space of coupling constants.
In string theories, whose small coupling limits are described by conformal field theories,
these moduli spaces arise as parameter spaces of string vacua. The 
understanding of moduli spaces of conformal field theories is thus a very important issue for
string theory. 

Although conformal field theories are quite well understood, there are
only few examples of explicitly known moduli spaces at present, most of which
correspond to free field theories as e.g. toroidal conformal field theories 
or orbifolds thereof. 

The reason for this is that a good conceptual understanding of
deformations of conformal field theories beyond conformal perturbation
theory is still lacking. Perturbation theory is usually technically involved, 
at least when one wants to obtain higher order contributions, and hence
is only applicable to study CFT moduli spaces in small neighbourhoods of 
explicitly known models. In particular it is in general not possible 
to obtain global information about the moduli spaces from perturbation
theory, except in situations, where symmetry as e.g. supersymmetry is
preserved by the corresponding deformations.

In this article, special deformations of conformal field theories, namely those
generated by perturbations with products of holomorphic and antiholomorphic currents are studied.
As was shown in, such deformations preserve the algebras 
of the perturbing fields. Indeed, this gives enough structure to determine 
global properties of the subspaces of moduli spaces corresponding to this kind
of deformations. 

Important examples of non-free conformal field theories 
admitting current-current deformations are WZW models (see
e.g.). The corresponding moduli spaces for WZW models 
associated to compact semi-simple Lie groups, will be discussed in detail.

Since WZW models have descriptions as sigma models on Lie groups,
it is a natural question if there are such descriptions for all
conformal field theories from these moduli spaces. 
In fact, families of sigma models containing WZW models at special
points have been discussed by many 
authors (e.g. in
).
In particular one-parameter families of sigma models 
containing the -WZW models have been studied very explicitly by
Giveon and Kiritsis , who also compared them
to the families of current-current deformed -WZW models which were
described in. 
Ideas about a generalization of these 
considerations to arbitrary WZW models have also been presented in
.

In this article, WZW-like sigma model representations 
of current-current deformed WZW models will be
explicitly constructed.  
These are sigma models with the same target space as the
"undeformed" WZW model in the family, but 
with different (in general not bi-invariant) metrics and additional -fields. 

Thus, we obtain explicit descriptions of the moduli spaces of
current-current deformed WZW models associated to compact semi-simple Lie groups
in terms of conformal field theories as well as in terms of sigma models. 

In section two, exactly marginal current-current deformations of conformal
field theories are discussed.
We start from the facts obtained in,
that perturbations of conformal field theories
with products of holomorphic and antiholomorphic currents are exactly 
marginal iff the holomorphic as well as the antiholomorphic currents 
belong to commutative current algebras, and that in this case
these holomorphic and antiholomorphic current algebras are preserved
under the deformations. 
This can be used to reduce the problem of studying finite current-current deformations
to first order deformation theory, which is carried out in , 
and from which it follows that the 
effect of these deformations on the CFT structures is completely captured by
pseudo orthogonal transformations of their charge lattices with respect 
to the preserved commutative current algebras. 
The corresponding deformation spaces can thus be described by
D O (d,d  )/O (d)O (d ).
This generalizes the deformation results of toroidal conformal field 
theories.
The corresponding moduli spaces are obtained from the deformation spaces
by taking the quotients with respect to "duality groups".

In section three we discuss an important class of examples, namely WZW models
corresponding to compact semi-simple Lie-groups.
The general results from section two are compared to a realization of
deformed WZW models obtained from a representation of WZW models as 
orbifolds of products of generalized parafermionic 
and toroidal models given in. 

In section four we discuss various aspects of exactly marginal
deformations of WZW models from a sigma model perspective. This
approach is best suited for a semiclassical treatment and in that
sense less powerful than the algebraic one. However, it can illustrate
the results and provide a picture for the class of deformed models. 
Exactly marginal deformations of WZW models from the sigma model
perspective have been discussed in the past mainly for rank one
groups and for models
where coordinates can be chosen 
such that the relevant set of chiral and anti-chiral currents follows
manifestly from the equations of motion.

Mimicking the orbifold realization of deformed WZW models described
in section three, we will consider an orbifold of a direct product
consisting of a vectorially gauged WZW model and a 
d -dimensional torus model, where d  is the rank of the group. 
Since a sigma model is not very well designed to accommodate orbifolds, we perform an
axial-vector duality (generalized T-duality) to obtain a dual
description without an additional orbifold action. To this end, we
first implement the orbifold by gauging in addition an axial symmetry
of the WZW model combined with shifts in the torus factor. We force
the corresponding gauge bundle to be flat but choose the zero modes of
the corresponding Lagrange multiplier such that the gauge bundle is
twisted in a non-trivial way. It turns out that integrating out the
gauge bundle instead of the Lagrange multiplier provides a sigma model
without an additional orbifold action. The result is a "WZW-like"
model, i.e. a sigma model with Lie group as target space, and
an action given by a WZW action in which the bi-invariant metric is
replaced by a more general bilinear form which is neither bi-invariant nor necessarily
symmetric.

The same sigma models can be obtained as coset models of a 
product of the original WZW model and d -dimensional torus models
with gauge group , embedded into both factors.

All the sigma model manipulations described so far are 
carried out at a classical level. Quantum
mechanically one should replace the procedure of solving equations of
motion by performing Gaussian integrals. These in general provide
functional determinants, which in turn generate a non-trivial
dilaton. In a pragmatic approach this can be computed by imposing
conformal invariance, i.e. requiring vanishing beta functions. 
We will use a more elegant way consisting of a comparison of the
Hamiltonian of the model and a generalized Laplacian, which depends 
on the dilaton. 

Finally, we illustrate some of the results in the 
example of the deformed -WZW model.

We should mention that many of the employed techniques
can be found in the literature. The corresponding references will be
given in the text.


Current-Current Deformations of CFTs 


Although not proven in general, it is widely believed that all deformations
of conformal field theories are generated by perturbations of the
theories with marginal fields, i.e. fields  with conformal
weights . 

The perturbed correlation functions on a conformal 
surface  of a combination of 
operators ,  are defined to be
deformation 
X(p_1,,p_k)_^:=X(p_1,,p_k)
(_i_i_O _i d_) 
_,  
where the integrals have to be regularized due to the appearance of
singularities. If the perturbed correlation functions
define a quantum field theory, which is a fixed point of the
renormalization group flow, it is again a conformal field theory. This
however is not the case in general. Indeed, 
preservation of conformal invariance by perturbations gives non linear
restrictions on the fields, which generate it (see
e.g.).  
This means that the set of
exactly marginal fields, i.e. those which generate deformations of conformal 
field theories are not vector spaces in general. In particular the
deformation spaces 
of conformal field theories need not necessarily be manifolds but may have 
singularities. (For more details on conformal deformation theory see
e.g.).  

In the following, deformations of conformal field theories generated
by a special class of marginal  
fields, namely products of holomorphic and antiholomorphic currents
will be discussed.  
These are simple enough to give a global description of 
the deformation spaces corresponding to them 
and to express the data of deformed CFTs explicitly in terms of the data of 
the undeformed ones.

We consider conformal field theories, whose holomorphic 
and antiholomorphic -algebras contain current algebras , 
 corresponding to Lie algebras  and  and
, i.e.
for every  there exist holomorphic fields  of 
conformal weight  in the theory, such that
currentalg 
j(z)j(w)=k K_ (j,j)(z-w)^2 +[j,j](w)(z-w) +reg 

T(z)j(w)=j(w)(z-w)^2 +j(w)(z-w) +reg ,where  is a bi-invariant scalar product on  and
 its Lie bracket.  
The holomorphic energy momentum tensor  can be written as
T(z)=T_0(z)+12(k+g ) 
_,  ^g_ :j^(z)j^(z):,
^:=K^-1 _,
with  the dual Coxeter number of ,
 a basis of  and .
The same holds for the antiholomorphic current algebra with  replaced
by .

In particular, there is a subspace of the CFT Hilbert space isomorphic to 
 of marginal fields. However, not all of these fields
are exactly marginal. As was shown in, such
fields are exactly marginal if and only if, under the isomorphism
above, they correspond to elements of , 
for any abelian subalgebras ,
. Moreover deformations 
generated by these exactly marginal fields preserve the current
algebras ,  corresponding to , .

Hence, every pair of abelian , 
 gives rise to a
family of  
conformal field theories with current algebras , .
All these families meet in the original model. 
Since conformal field theories are invariant under automorphisms of their
holomorphic and antiholomorphic -algebras, pairs which are identified
under such automorphisms give rise to equivalent deformations.

We assume in the following that the conformal field theory is unitary,
and its Hilbert space  
decomposes into tensor products of
irreducible highest weight representations ,  of 
, , which are characterized
by their charges , , and whose lowest
conformal 
weights are given by , 
, as can 
be read off from currentalg (From now on 
, 
.) : 
decomp 
_(Q,Q ) _QQ  _Q _Q  .   
The set of charges  forms a lattice
equipped with bilinear pairing  
. 

As is shown in , deformations corresponding to
pairs  only affect the representation 
theory of the -algebras , , but not the
OPE-coefficients of -highest  
weight vectors. More precisely, if one chooses suitable connections on
the bundles of Hilbert spaces over the 
deformation spaces, the effect of the
deformations on the 
CFT structures 
is completely captured by transformations of the charge
lattices  in the identity component  of the
pseudo orthogonal group , and all structures
independent of the charges 
are parallel with respect to the chosen connection.

That these -transformations indeed give rise to 
new modular invariant partition functions and also preserve
locality is easy to see even without any perturbation theory. 
Locality is maintained because of the preservation of 
 by transformations . 
To show the preservation of modular invariance 
we consider the torus partition function depending on modular parameters
 and  (, )
of the -transformed model along a smooth path
 with ,  

Z^O(t) (q,q )&:=&tr _(q^L_0^O(t)  -c    12  q ^L _0^O(t) -c12   
)

&=&tr _(q^L_0-c12  q ^L _0-c12  
e^i() (O(t)^*-1).,.((j_0,
   _0),(j_0, _0)) . 


&&. e^-() (O(t)^*-1) 
  ((j_0, _0),(j_0, _0))  
)

&=&
tr _(q^L_0-c12  q ^L _0-c12  
e^-() (O(t)^*-1) 
  ((j_0, _0),(j_0, _0))  
)and use the modular transformation properties of the unspecialized characters:
_t Z^O(t) (q,q )_t=0 &=&
() T_  tr _(j_0^ _0^   q^L_0-c    12  q ^L _0-c12    
)

&=&
-() 4^2 T_  _z_ 
_z _   _z=z =0  
tr _(q^L_0-c12  q ^L _0-c12  
e^2i (z,j_0) e^-2  i (z , _0) ) 


&=&
-() 4^2 T_  _z_ 
_z _   _z=z =0  
tr _(
q ^L_0-c12  q  ^L _0-c    12  e^2i (z ,j_0)  
e^-2i (z   , _0) )


&=&
(-1 ) 
T_    tr _(j_0^ _0^  
q ^L_0-c12  q  ^L _0-c12   
)

&=&
_t Z^O(t) (q ,q  )_t=0 ,where , 
.  
This shows that invariance under the 
modular transformation  
is preserved under -transformations of the charge
lattices.  
A similar calculation proves the statement for .

Since charges  only characterize the
-modules up to automorphisms 
of the underlying Lie algebras, transformations of  by 
 
leave the conformal field theory invariant.
Thus, the deformation spaces corresponding to pairs  are given by
defspace 
D _(a,a ) O (d,d )_0/((O (d)O (d ))
O (d,d )_0)
O (d,d )/O (d)O (d )
.
To get the respective moduli spaces from these deformation spaces, 
one has to identify points describing
equivalent conformal field theories. 
In fact, the conformal field theories are specified by the charge lattices
marked with the Hilbert spaces  
of -highest weight states 
(with all the structure they carry, as e.g. structure of modules 
of the Virasoro algebra etc.) and the coefficients of 
the operator product expansion of these highest weight states. 
Denoting these additional structures by , and the automorphisms of
  
together with  by , the components of the moduli
spaces corresponding to  deformations can be written as
defmod 
M _(, ) 
Aut (,S)O (d,d )/  O (d)O (d ) 
.
If the action of  has fixed points, 
 has singularities and 
the Hilbert space bundle over it has non-trivial monodromies around
  them. More precisely elements in   
act on the Hilbert space bundles over the deformation spaces, and
  monodromies around fixed points  
are given by the respective actions of the stabilizers.

This gives a very explicit description of the components of moduli
spaces of conformal 
field theories corresponding to current-current deformations. In
particular conformal field  
theories as above come in  families of
explicitly known CFTs, and the 
conformal field theory data at any point in these families can be
easily reconstructed  
from the CFT data at one point. 

A well known example of this kind is the moduli space of toroidal
conformal field theories.  
These models have holomorphic and antiholomorphic -algebras,
each of which contains a  current-algebra.
They are completely characterized by their charge lattices 
( are trivial for all charges), 
which for integer spin of the fields, locality and modular 
invariance of the torus partition function have 
to be even, integral, selfdual lattices of signature  in 
. 
Hence,  is trivial and 
, such that 
the moduli spaces  corresponding to the current-current 
deformations are isomorphic to the Narain moduli spaces 
tormod 
M ^Narain _dO (d,d,)  O (d,d)/O (d)O (d), 
of even, integral selfdual lattices of 
signature  in . This is the entire moduli space
of toroidal conformal field theories.

A more general class of conformal field theories with 
current algebras are WZW models. These are discussed 
in the next section.




Deformations of WZW Models 

WZW models are conformal field theories associated to Lie groups 
with bi-invariant  
metrics  (see e.g.).
For simplicity we will only consider compact semi-simple  with
bi-invariant metrics 
corresponding to the Killing forms on the respective Lie algebras here.

So, let ,  a semi-simple Lie-group,  its
Lie-algebra of rank 
 with Killing form ,  
roots , weights , root lattice , 
long root lattice ,
and weight lattice . 
Furthermore denote by  the set of integrable weights
of the affine Lie-algebra  at level .

The WZW models associated to  have the affine Lie algebras
 as holomorphic and  
antiholomorphic -algebras. Its Hilbert spaces decompose into tensor
products of integrable  
highest weight representations ,
 
of . For simplicity only diagonal WZW models are considered 
in the following, i.e. those WZW models whose Hilbert spaces are given by
__k _ 
 _ . 
Generically, the only marginal fields in WZW models are products of
holomorphic and antiholomorphic currents from the current algebras.  
From the general considerations in section  it is clear
that every pair of Cartan subalgebras , 
gives rise to deformations of the WZW models. 
However, all such pairs lead to equivalent deformations, because all
maximal abelian subalgebras of a semi-simple Lie algebra are pairwise
conjugated(This is not true for non-semi-simple 
Lie algebras, where one gets more interesting moduli spaces.) . 
Thus the deformation space of current-current-deformed
WZW models is given by
D _WZW O (d,d)/O (d)O (d).
For a given Cartan subalgebra  the integrable
-highest weight representations 
decompose into -highest weight modules , 
as follows 
_  __k _, ^ext _ 
__k _, _Q _l() _(+k) , 
where  is a finite abelian group,
 is a highest weight module 
of a generalized parafermionic -algebra associated to the coset
construction ,   
and  are highest weight modules with respect to an
extended  -algebra 
(In terms of characters
    
corresponding to the -highest weight representations, 
this is just the string function decomposition 






with  the string functions and  the
Dedekind--function.) . 

From this, the charge lattice can be read off to be 
chargelattice 
_0=(, )P ()P () Q ().
The "duality group" is given by the automorphisms
of  compatible with the additional structures , alluded to in the last section.
In the case of diagonal WZW models discussed here, all these structure are determined by 
representation theory, and the duality group is given by the 
semi-direct product 
Aut (_0,S_k)A ()W ()
of the automorphism group  of the root lattice  with the  
Weyl group , where  acts diagonally on ,
and  acts on the second factor only (see for a discussion
of dualities of WZW models). 
Since 
, the "duality" groups can be written as 
gduality 
Aut (_0,S_k)(W ()W ())F (), 
with the Weyl groups acting separately on the two factors of  and 
acting diagonally.
Note that these groups are finite, as opposed to the "duality groups" of
-dimensional toroidal models for . For the special case , the group
gduality  coincide with the toroidal "duality" group .

Given the duality group, the moduli space of current-current deformed
WZW models can now be written as
tormod 
M _WZW (W ()  W ())F ()O (d,d)/
  O (d)O (d). 
In fact,  has an even integral selfdual sublattice
_k:=(, )P ()P () kQ _l()_0
of signature , which can 
be regarded as charge lattice of -dimensional
toroidal conformal field theory. 

Let us denote by 
 
the subgroup of the duality group fixing . This group is also a subgroup of .

Every even integral selfdual sublattice of  of signature
, which  
is obtained from  by applying a transformation of 
 
gives rise to a representation of the WZW model as orbifold model
orbrep 
 _k( _k/ t__k  )/_k. 
of a product of a
coset model  and a toroidal conformal field theory 
 with charge lattices .
Such representations were presented inand were actually used in
  in the study of dualities of WZW and coset models.

The torus partition function of coset and toroidal models (with the
notation from footnote )  
are given by
pfpart  
Z^ _k/  (q,q )=_  _k 
__k     
(q)^2d  c^  _(q) c ^  _(q ),

tpart 
Z^t __k  (q,q )=
__k _ (q)  _ (q )
  (q)^2d     
=_(, )   q^^22k 
  q ^ ^22k (q)^2d  . 
 acts on the Hilbert spaces of the models by
Gammaaction 
_k:
__ ,  _ ,   
&=&e^i(,+ )    id __ ,   _ ,   ,

__ ^ext  _  ^ext  
&=&e^-i(,+ )  id __ ^ext 
   _  ^ext  ,giving rise to the -twisted torus partition functions
for  
twcospart 
Z^ _k/  _, (q,q )&=&
_  _k __k  
e^i(, 2- ) (q)^2d  c^  _(q) 
c ^  _- (q ),

twtpart 
Z^t _  _, (q,q )&=&
__k  e^-i(, 2_(q) _q )(q)^2d  .
From this, one can easily read off, that the orbifold partition function of
orbrep 
Z^orb (q,q )=1_k _,_k 
Z^ _k/  _, (q,q )Z^    t _  _,  (q,q )
agrees with the torus partition function of the diagonal -WZW model
Z^ _k (q,q )=_  _k 
_  (q)_  (q ). 
The fact that the orbifold group  acts trivially on the
-algebras of coset and toroidal models 
makes this representation of the WZW models useful for the study of
current-current deformations. 
Namely, for given  the holomorphic and antiholomorphic
-algebras  
 and  
can be identified with the ,  -algebras of
,  
and deformations corresponding to  are then just
deformations of the toroidal factor  in orbrep . 

Thus, for a point  the corresponding conformal
field theory can be represented as(A realization of the torus
partition function of the deformed -WZW models  
as a partition function of -orbifolds of tensor product of
parafermionic models and 
free bosonic theories  
has already been given in.) 
deforb 
 _k(O)( _k/   t_O_k  )/_k. 
This provides concrete isomorphisms between 
current-current deformation spaces of WZW- and toroidal models.
Note however that in general the "duality" groups of the WZW models  
and the toroidal models  do not agree. On the one hand, there might
be dualities in the WZW models which do not preserve  and thus correspond 
to a change of the orbifold representation, and on the other hand dualities in the 
toroidal model need not lift to automorphisms of  together with . As noted above,
for , the duality group of the WZW model and the corresponding toroidal models coincide.

In fact, the conformal field theories in  have WZW-like 
sigma model descriptions, which will be discussed in section .





Sigma Model Considerations 

Orbifold, Current-Current Deformation and
  Coset  

To show that the deformed WZW models discussed above in fact have
WZW-like sigma model descriptions, i.e. they are described by WZW-type
actions,  
however with metrics different from the bi-invariant metrics and
additional -fields, 
we write down a sigma model action, which on the one hand defines
orbifold models as in deforb  and on the other hand describes
WZW-like models.


Let us start by describing the ingredients used to construct this sigma model.
As above, we denote by  a compact semi-simple Lie group of
rank  with Lie algebra 
, Cartan subgroup , corresponding Cartan
subalgebra   
and . Furthermore,
 is a -dimensional surface, bounding the three manifold
. Then, an  
asymmetrically gauged WZW model  on  is described by the
following action 
agWZW 
S^asym _G ,k (g,A ,B ,):= S_G ,k ^  WZW (g)+S_G ,k ^vg (g,A )+S_G ,k ^  ag (g,B )  
+S_G ,k ^c (g,A ,B )+S_G ,k ^  L (,B ), 
where
WZW 
S_G ,k ^WZW (g)=-k4 (_d^2z g^-1 
g, g^-1  g13 _B g^*)
is the WZW action with , 
 the Killing 
form on , and  the three form on 
associated to . The integral
over  in 
WZW  is called 
Wess-Zumino term . WZW  defines a quantum field theory 
if  and ,
which we assume to hold. 
This WZW model is 
vectorially coupled (see e.g.) to an 
-gauge connection 
 by 
vectorpart 
S^vg _G ,k (g,A )=k 2  _d^2 z
 < A, 
    g^-1  _z   g> - < _z g g^-1 ,
    A > - < (1- Ad _g) A,
    A >  ,
and axially coupled (see e.g.)
to an 
-gauge connection 
 by 
axialpart 
S^ag _G ,k (g,B )= k 2  _d^2 z 
< B, 
    g^-1 _z   g> + < _z g g^-1  ,
    B > -    < ( 1 +Ad _g) B,
    B >  .
Adding both terms vectorpart  and axialpart  to the WZW
action WZW , one obtains the general asymmetrically gauged model,
provided we introduce a coupling between the two gauge fields 
 and  

coupling 
S^c _G ,k (g,A ,B )=k 2  _d^2 z
<( 1+ 
    Ad _g) B,
    A >  -< ( 1+Ad _g) A,
    B >  .
This contains more terms than the interaction given
in, where however a constraint relating the two gauge
fields was imposed. We avoid such a constraint by introducing a
Lagrange multiplier

lmultiplier 
S^L _G ,k ( , B ) = ik  
_d^2z    
-< _z ,B > +< B,
    _z  > ,
with , where
 is the 
image of  under the isomorphism between  and 
provided by . 

This model will be coupled to an axially gauged -WZW model, i.e.
an axially gauged -dimensional toroidal model
ypart 
S_H ,k,E (y ,B ) =-k 4  _d^2 z
< ( 
    y^-1 _z y -2B), E( y^-1 _z  y
    -2B ) > ,
where , and metric and -field are
parametrized by an invertible -matrix with positive
definite symmetric part 
.

Below, it will be argued that the action
ausgangsmodell 
S_G ,k (g,A ,B ,,y):=S_G ,k ^asym (g,  A ,B ,)+S_H ,k,E (y,B ) 
describes the current-current deformed -WZW models discussed in 
section . In fact the vectorially gauged -WZW
model part 
 of the action
ausgangsmodell   
describes the parafermionic factor
in the orbifold representation 
deforb  of the deformed models, while the -part
ypart  describes 
the toroidal one. The axial gauging which couples these two parts in
ausgangsmodell   
amounts to the orbifold-construction in deforb .

To see this, we will make use of the local symmetries of the model
ausgangsmodell  under vector transformations

 

with ,
and axial transformations

 

with 
. 

Let us first integrate out the Lagrange multiplier field .
Performing a partial integration in lmultiplier  yields

S^L _G ,k (,B )
&=&ik  _(-d, B +, F (B ))

&=& 2ik _i n_i,__i B +ik _, F (B ).
where  is the curvature of ,  represent
the non-trivial one-cycles of  and  are the "winding
numbers" of  
around the dual cycles. Thus, the Lagrange multiplier forces  to be
flat with logarithms of monodromies around (A
  similar construction was used in.)   
monodromy 
b_i:=__i B (2kQ _l())^*12k P ().
Now, axial gauge transformations can shift the  by elements in
. 
Therefore, the gauge equivalence classes of flat connections 
 satisfying monodromy  
are completely characterized by 

, 
and the integration over the gauge field  reduces to summing
over these .  
Note that  
is nothing else than the orbifold group in the orbifold representation
of the deformed WZW models deforb . 

Having integrated out  and  we end up with a
product of an -gauged -WZW model, corresponding to the
parafermionic coset model ,  
and a -dimensional toroidal model parametrized by , which are
coupled by -twists. 
These twists indeed correspond to the -action
Gammaaction  on the Hilbert spaces  
of the conformal field theories 
, and the 
sigma models ausgangsmodell  describe the deformed WZW models
deforb . The identification of parametrizations of deformation spaces is 
as usual in toroidal CFTs:  acts on  by fractional
linear transformations, and we get  for  parametrizing
the orbifold models deforb  and  parametrizing the sigma models
ausgangsmodell . 

Next, we construct the "T-dual" models by integrating out 
first. Since  enters the action algebraically, this can be
done by solving the equations of motion and plugging back the
solution into the action.
The calculation simplifies if we gauge fix . Solving
the equations of motion for  yields

bsol 
B &=& ( PAd _g + 1 + 2E^T)^-1  
  P _z g 
  g^-1  -( 1+ Ad _g) A - 2^-1 _z
  ,

B  & = & ( PAd _g^-1   + 1 + 2E)^-1  
  P  g^-1 _z   g +(1
  +Ad _g^-1  ) A  + 2^-1 
  _z  ,
where  denotes the orthogonal projection on the
Cartan subalgebra  
and . This we plug back into the action
(). In the end, we will also integrate over . 
Therefore, we gauge fix  already at this stage. Then we obtain

afterb 
S_G ,k (g,A ) &=& S^WZW _G ,k (g) + S^  vg _G ,k ( g

      1+Ad _g) A ,

  &=& 
P 
      g^-1 _z   g +( 1 +  
Ad _g^-1  ) 
  A .
Next, we integrate out  by solving the classical
equations of motion

A & = & ( PAd _g -1 -( 1 +PAd _g) (
    PAd _g + 1 +2 E^T)^-1  (1
    +PAd _g))^-1  

& &  P _zg g^-1  -
    ( 1 +PAd _g) ( 
    PAd _g + 1 + 2E^T)^-1  P  _z g

A & =& ( PAd _g^-1   -1 -( 1
    +PAd _g^-1  ) ( 
    PAd _g^-1   + 1 + 2E)^-1  (1
    +PAd _g^-1  ))^-1  

& & - P g^-1  _z  g  +
    ( 1 +PAd _g^-1  ) ( 
    PAd _g^-1   + 1 + 2E)^-1  P g^-1 
    _z   g 
     .
Plugging this back into the action and performing some algebra yields

wzwform 
S_G ,k (g) &=& S^WZW _G ,k  +k 2  d^2
z < ( 
    PAd _g -R^-1 )^-1 
    P  _z g g^-1  , P  g^-1  _z

&=&-k4 _      E _gg^-1 _zg,g^-1 _z  g
+ k 12  _B g^*,with the abbreviations
R &:=& E^T-P E^T+P  ,

E _g &:=& (1-P )-(P
  Ad _g-R^-1 )^-1 (P Ad _g+R^-1 )
 
&=& (1-P )+(RPAd _g-P )^-1 
(RPAd _g+P ).
Thus, we obtain the action of a WZW-like model with a deformed metric and
additional B-field encoded in the choice of  and of the
matrix . As expected from the comparison with the CFT considerations
we recover the action of the original -WZW model for .

Note that in general deformed metric and -field are not
bi-invariant with respect to .  
But they are bi-invariant with respect to ,
which follows from the identities  
, 
 for all  
, .

Moreover, as also expected from the CFT results, 
for generic  the model ausgangsmodell  only has a 
 chiral symmetry algebra which is generated by
g = g - g R,  g = g -R^T  g,
with .
The corresponding chiral currents read 
hcurrents 
J & = & k R^-1 ( 1 -RR^T) (
PAd _g - R^-1 )^-1  P  _z g g^-1  , 

J  & = & - k  (R^T )^-1 ( 1- R^T R ) (
PAd _g^-1   - (R^T )^-1 )^-1  P 
g^-1 _z   g .Let us mention that the two degenerations of the model ausgangsmodell 
, , 
correspond to the axially and the vectorially gauged WZW model
respectively(This 
can be easily seen by comparing the sigma model
actions. Alternatively, it can be deduced by the following
observation. For  the additional  factor decouples and
integrating over  yields the "T-dualized" orbifold of the
vectorially gauged model, i.e. the axially gauged model. On the other
hand in the limit  the gauge field  is frozen
to zero and we are left with the vectorially gauged model. In both
cases there is an additional decoupled  factor whose torus is
of vanishing size or decompactified, respectively. In our previous
discussion this additional factor appears, because in the decoupling
limits the gauge fixing conditions need to be altered, i.e in those
limits one should gauge fix coordinates on  such that the metric on
the coset does not degenerate.) .
Thus, at the classical level, we achieved to construct a class of models
connecting the axially gauged WZW model via the ungauged to the
vectorially gauged one.

Moreover, the response
of our sigma model () to a variation of the deformation
parameters 

 

is bilinear in the conserved currents hcurrents , suggesting that
our family is indeed generated by current-current perturbations.


So far, we have seen that the action of the deformed model looks like
a WZW model action with deformed bilinear form, which is generically not bi-invariant
anymore. This however is not the full story. When integrating out the
gauge fields, one picks up Jacobians which usually give rise to a
non-trivial dilaton. Hence, we
expect that in addition to the deformed metric and  field, there
will be a non-trivial dilaton. By construction our model should be
conformally invariant in the semiclassical limit. This means that the
background should satisfy beta function conditions (see e.g. the
review and references therein). Checking these
equations one 
will also observe that a non trivial dilaton (coupling with the power
of  to the sigma model action) is needed. That would be one way
to obtain the non-trivial dilaton. In the following subsection, we
will use a different method to derive the expression for the dilaton.

But before coming to that, let us comment on the relation of these 
deformed models to the families 
cosetaction 
S^(G H )/H  _E  (g,  B ,y):=S_G ,k ^WZW (g)+S_G ,k ^ag (g,  B )+S_H ,k,E  (y,B ) 
of gauged WZW models of type  
with varying embedding of the gauge group in the symmetry group of the
- and -WZW models, parametrized by . 
For the special case of symmetric  these models were described in. 

Integrating out the gauge fields  in these models,
one obtains(The result can be read off from bsol  
by setting ,  and
.) 
coset 
S^(G H )/H  _E  (g)=S_G ,k ^WZW (g)+
 k 2  d^2z <
  ( PAd _g +1 +2E ^T)^-1  P  _z
  g g^-1  , P  g^-1 _z   g>.
This in fact coincides with the action wzwform , which was
obtained by integrating out  in 
the sigma model ausgangsmodell  we started with, if one relates
the parameters 
relation-cos-orb 
E  = - E( E -1)^-1 .
Hence, for  such that  in relation-cos-orb  is well-defined
and positive definite, the sigma model ausgangsmodell  we started with
has a coset realization given by cosetaction . This is the case e.g.
for  whose eigenvalues lie in .
Note however that e.g. for ,  in relation-cos-orb  is
not well-defined 
and thus, the original -WZW model does not have a proper
coset realization as in cosetaction . 
It only corresponds to a degeneration thereof.
Nevertheless, for convenience, we will use the coset model realization
in the following subsection 
to calculate the Hamiltonian of the model
ausgangsmodell . Although the realization we use 
is only defined on part of the actual moduli space, we suppose that
the results we obtain are  
actually valid on the whole moduli space. This is supported by the
observation that they 
reproduce the correct results for the WZW model at .


Hamiltonian and Dilaton Shift 


Next, we would like to derive the Hamiltonian of the coset models
cosetaction . 
In order to perform the Legendre transform, we
return to Minkowskian worldsheet signature, i.e. 
, , 

 and . Let us first
discuss the ungauged -WZW model WZW . The conjugate momenta are given by

^T = ( S g^-1  _    g )^T = -k 4  g^-1 _g + , 

where  denotes the contribution from the Wess-Zumino
term. Since it contains exactly one  derivative,
its final effect drops out in the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is
obtained by performing the Legendre transform

 

where  stands for the Lagrangian belonging to WZW . 
Introducing the currents

J_+ = -k _+ g g^-1   , J_- = k g^-1 _- g 

we arrive at the classical Sugawara expression

sugawara 
H = -1 4k  d( < J_+,J_+> + <
    J_-, J_-> ) .

For later use, we also give these currents expressed as phase space
functions

 

In order to construct the Hamiltonian of the deformed 
-WZW models we follow 
the prescription given in, where our starting point
  will be the 
coset model cosetaction  before integrating out the gauge fields,
  but after gauge 
fixing , i.e. 

 

The additional terms as compared to the ungauged model modify the
conjugate momenta according to

^T ^T + k 2  B_+ + k 2 
Ad _g B_- .

The corresponding Hamiltonian reads

 

where  denotes the Hamiltonian sugawara  of the ungauged model.

Next, we modify the currents , such that
the modified currents

 

obey a gauge invariant Poisson algebra (see for more details).
In terms of the new currents the Hamiltonian of the deformed model is given by

 

The additional constraints due to the vanishing of the conjugate
momenta of  
can be used to eliminate the gauge fields by solving
their algebraic equations of motion

 

Since for  invertible(The degeneration  for example
describes the
  coset model  which 
  is discussed in.)  these equations allow
  a unique 
  solution for . Before giving this it is useful to employ
  () and () to simplify the expression
  () slightly. For the last term we write





and obtain

H  = -1 4k d( < J _+,    J _+> + < J _-, J _-> +2k< B_+,
    J _-  > -2k< B_-, J _+>) .

Finally, we plug in the solutions

 

The result for the Hamiltonian of the deformed model is

 

For symmetric  this expression agrees with the one given
in.

Now, the zero mode part of the Hamiltonian restricted to a certain subspace of the Hilbert space 
should "match" with the generalized Laplacian on the space of smooth functions on genlaplace 
^:=-e^2  det (G)  _  e^-2 det (G) G^  _,
which takes into account the dilaton .
This can be explained (for more details see) 
by the correspondence of the 
constraint 

constr 
( L_0 +L _0 - a) physical > = 0 
( is the zero mode of the Hamiltonian and
 is a normal ordering constant)

with the mass shell condition, which in location space reads

massshell 
e^2  det (G)  _(
  e^-2  
  det (G) G^  _) = -m^2 .

Here  denotes the target space field associated to the physical
state in (). This will be used in the following to determine the
dilaton in the deformed -WZW models.

The subspace of the Hilbert space which should correspond to the space of functions
on  consists of highest weight vectors only (seefor a discussion of this point), and thus the Hamiltonian finalH  
restricted to this subspace can be written completely in terms of zero-modes 
of left and right currents. 
Since zero-modes of left and right chiral currents are the generators of left- and inverse right-
multiplication by  on itself, they can be identified with the respective sections
 and  of . Choosing a basis of , one obtains from these
sections the vector fields , ,  on .
In every point , ,  are two basis 
of the tangent space  of  in . Hence,  can be written
in terms of  or ,  and the target space metric . 
 can be read off from the kinetic term
of the action wzwform , such that we can compare  with the Hamilton operator
finalH  to obtain . This is the general strategy presented in. 

But before applying it to the the models ausgangsmodell , let us illustrate it 
in the example of the "undeformed" -WZW model.
For notational convenience, we will use the sections 
 and  of 
in the following computations and denote the dual Killing
form on  by .
Now, the target space metric is  times the bi-invariant metric
induced by the Killing form. The Laplace 
operator can then be written as
1 k  j_L , j_L =
1 k  j_R ,j_R =
1 2k ( j_L, j_L + j_R, j_R ),

where the second equality
reflects the bi-invariance of the metric.

Observing that under the identification , ,
of zero-modes of the holomorphic and antiholomorphic currents with generators of the left and right
multiplication 
the zero-mode part of the Hamiltonian sugawara  "matches" the 
Laplacian , we deduce that the dilaton  is constant.

Now let us come to the discussion of the deformed models ausgangsmodell . The Hamiltonian
corresponding to the coset representation of these models has been calculated above finalH .
The target space metric can be
  obtained from () by symmetrization(As noted before the actions
ausgangsmodell  and coset  agree under the identification relation-cos-orb ,
and we will use the parametrization by  for the calculation of , 
because the Hamiltonian finalH  was obtained in the coset representation. This however
does not restrict the region of validity of the results.) 

 

with

 

Now, the generalized Laplacian can be written as

4k ^= < f^-1  j_L , f M^-1  j_L > + <
  f^-1  j_R, fN^-1 j_R > ,

where derivatives act on everything appearing to their right, and

f= e^-2  det (G) /det (G_0)  ,

with  denoting the "undeformed", i.e. the Killing metric on .   
The expression for the inverse of  is

 

In order to obtain this result we have performed a couple of
manipulations. First, we employed that 









which follows from P being a projector. Then  takes a block diagonal form, and we
have inverted the two blocks ( and the rest) on the corresponding
subspaces. 
Furthermore, on the Cartan subalgebra  (where P=1) we used
the following identities

 

The last line of () is most easily checked with the
inverted expression

 
Analogously, one finds

 

In order to write down the result for the Laplacian, we also
need the relations





Collecting everything, we finally obtain

 

This expression matches with the Hamiltonian () provided
that  is equal to a constant, which can be taken to one by
performing a constant dilaton shift. Thus, we conclude that along the
deformations there is a non trivial dilaton such that

det (G) e^-2   is independent of   .

As a byproduct we see from laplaceF  that eigenfunctions of
 at a given ,  
which are also eigenfunctions with respect to the -actions induced
by the left and right multiplication of  on  are also eigenfunctions of 
at all , with different 
eigenvalues however. This is expected from the CFT considerations above, 
where the only effect of the deformations were changes of the ,
 charges, and -, -highest weight states remained 
highest weight states under the deformations. 

To complete the discussion we should recall that the coset description
we used here to construct the Hamiltonian finalH  is only valid in the part of the 
parameter space of the model ausgangsmodell , where  is positive
definite. In particular, it
breaks down, when one of the eigenvalues of  becomes .
Nevertheless, the Hamiltonian, we obtained, can be continued to
the region where  has eigenvalues , as can be read off from

  

and in fact for  it coincides with the one of the -WZW model 
sugawara .
This suggests that finalHwE  is indeed the Hamiltonian on the whole parameter
space of ausgangsmodell  and all the results from this section also apply to
the entire moduli space. 


The  Example 

In this subsection we would like to illustrate our previous discussion very explicitly in 
the simplest example, namely . We do not want to go through
all the details, since much of the discussion for  (or
)(The discussion of deformation is often
  presented for the non compact version of  because in that case
  the interesting phenomenon of smooth topology change is
  observed.)   can be found in the literature
(e.g. in), but we will   
address two topics here, which were important in the previous sections. 
Firstly, we will derive the deformed sigma model 
by taking the T-dual of the model
, 
and secondly we will compute the spectrum of the generalized Laplacian.

From the discussion of current-current deformed WZW models corresponding
to arbitrary compact semi-simple Lie groups in section , 
we know that the deformed -WZW models can be realized as orbifold models
(compare deforb )
(su  (2)_k/u  (1)      u  (1)_k R )/Z _k, 
where  parametrizes the
-factor(As alluded to above,  is a
  duality.) .  
That the deformed -WZW model can be written in this way
has first been suggested  
by Yang in, where 
a one-parameter family of modular invariant partition functions corresponding
to such orbifold models with varying radius in the -factor
was presented, 
noting that the partition function at  coincides with the
partition function of the -WZW model
.  

In the following we will compare this with explicit sigma model
analysis. 
  We start with the  gauged
  sigma model (the  
  parametrization is taken from)(In
    order to make contact with our general discussion in
    subsection  we note that in an 
     group element is written as 



. The dependence on  is
      removed after performing the vector gauging. Constant shifts in
       correspond to the axial symmetry. The orbifold action
      of  will be specified below in the discussion
      after (). It essentially reduces the radius of a
      circle lying diagonally in the -torus.)  

S=k 2  d^2z _+ x_- x + ^2x
  _+ _- + 1 R^2  _+
  y_- y ,

where for the time being we omitted the dilaton term coupling to the
Gauss-Bonnet density. Now, we redefine coordinates according to

=  +  ,
y =-
In these coordinates the relevant components of the target space metric can be written as

 

Now we T-dualize the  direction. 



The T-dual metric and -field follow from the
Buscher fromul . We obtain

 

Now we define ,  and
drop the constant term 1 in the -field. 
This amounts to 

 

It remains to discuss the periodicity of . 
In order to obtain the deformed model  should be a
 periodic coordinate, i.e.  should be a 
 periodic coordinate. If we perform the T-duality according to the
prescription given in, the intermediate gauged sigma
model on a worldsheet  will contain a term (compare genorb )

S_wind  = _i n_i __i  A  , 

where  are one cycles of  and 
 are the winding numbers of the Lagrange
multiplier  around one cycles of 
 dual to . 
As in the discussion around genorb , 
summing over the  valued windings of
 yields a Kronecker delta, which is non-vanishing if 
takes values in . Since the original model is
obtained by absorbing a pure gauge 
into a redefinition of the
original coordinate,  parameterises actually an orbifold
 where  is the unit circle. 

Thus for the case  we explicitly obtained the 
deformed WZW action wzwform  from the orbifold representation
.

Next, we would like to discuss the generalized Laplacian  in this
example. For notational simplicity we set  during the
calculation and reinstall it in the end. 
After a coordinate change

= x

the metric of the deformed model takes the form

ds^2 = d^2 1-^2  +^2 1+( R^2 -1)^2 
d^2 + R^2( 1-^2) 1+( R^2 -1)
  ^2  d ^2 .

Up to a constant shift, the dilaton is given by the relation

e^-2 det (G)  =.

Thus, we find explicitly

^_R=e^2  det (G)   _  e^-2 det (G) G^ _R=1 +(R^2-1)_^2
+(1-R^2)R^2 _  ^2,
which shows that eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator corresponding to the Killing metric
on  which are also eigenfunctions of , 
are in fact eigenfunctions of the generalized Laplacian  for all (Note that at   
as discussed in the previous section.) , however with different
eigenvalues. For an eigenfunction of the Laplace operator in the irreducible  representation
labelled by  with left and right -quantum numbers  and , the
difference of the eigenvalues of  at  and  is given by

eigenvalues 
^k_j,n,m (R) = R^2 -1 4k  n^2 +1
  -R^2 4kR^2  n ^2 ,

where we have reintroduced the level . 

Now, let us compare this with the CFT description deforb .
The difference of -eigenvalues of a 
  highest weight state in the -twisted sector for  and  can be
calculated to be

 

where we already identified the moduli spaces according to our general discussion.

We observe that () and
() agree, if we identify

n = m  , 
n  = m-r,
and this identification is actually the one we expected from the
-action as in  
Gammaaction .


Discussion 

Having shown that the effect of current-current deformations
of a conformal field theory on its structure is completely
captured by deformations of a charge lattice, we
obtained a description of the subspaces of CFT moduli spaces 
corresponding to these deformations as moduli spaces 
of certain lattices with additional structure. This generalizes
the case of deformations of toroidal conformal field theories
.

The general considerations were applied to WZW models, where
they were compared with a realization
of the deformed models as orbifolds of products of coset models
with varying toroidal models.
This realization was well suited for the construction
of sigma models corresponding to the deformed WZW models.
For this purpose we employed axial-vector
duality to transform the orbifold of the -sigma model
into a WZW-like model with (in general) non-bi-invariant metric, 
additional -field and constant dilaton. This provides a very 
explicit description of the sigma models associated to deformed
WZW models. It would be interesting to investigate further the geometry of 
metric and -field we obtained for the deformed models. Since the sigma models
correspond to conformal field theories, they should for example satisfy some nice
differential equations, namely the beta-function equations
(see and references therein).

Apart from the general CFT considerations, we focused the discussion 
on the example of WZW models associated to compact, semi-simple Lie groups.
There are however other interesting conformal field theories
admitting current-current deformations, which deserve an analysis of their
moduli spaces. 
These are for example WZW models corresponding to non-compact
Lie-groups (see e.g.
), 
which could provide time dependent exact string backgrounds and thus might 
give hints about 
how string theory deals with cosmological
singularities (see e.g.
 for a discussion of
this point).  
But also an investigation of moduli spaces of e.g. coset models, and in particular 
Kazama-Suzuki-models 
 should be of interest, because the latter
would provide examples of 
explicitly known moduli spaces of  superconformal field
theories. A discussion of 
the relation between mirror symmetry and gauge symmetry in this
setting has been presented in.

The analysis of the "behaviour" of D-branes (i.e. conformal boundary
conditions) on moduli spaces of conformal field theories was in fact 
the main motivation for this study of current-current deformations.
As our considerations show, these deformations are in fact easily tractable,
and hence provide a good setup to study "bulk-deformations" of boundary conformal
field theories.
Some semi-classical aspects of D-branes in deformed -WZW models
were presented in.
The general conformal field theory analysis of boundary conditions 
in deformed WZW models will be 
addressed in a forthcoming publication.

Appendix section  

Deformation theory 
section  

In this appendix, techniques from conformal deformation theory (see e.g. 
)
are used to 
calculate  
the effect of current-current deformations on arbitrary conformal
field theories 
containing current algebras in their holomorphic and antiholomorphic
-algebras. 

In the following, a family of conformal field theories is regarded 
as a Hermitian vector bundle over a differentiable
manifold(Singularities do not occur in our situation.) 
parametrizing deformations of the conformal field theory structures in
a smooth way,  
i.e. all CFT structures are smooth sections of corresponding vector bundles.

Such families can be realized as perturbations deformation  by
exactly marginal fields. In this case, the tangent bundle of their
base manifolds 
are subbundles of  
the Hermitian vector bundles. The choice of regularization method and
renormalization scheme 
gives rise to connections on them. Here
connections  
(called  in) 
will be used, which restrict to the Levi-Civita connections on the
tangent bundles of the base  
manifolds equipped with the respective Zamolodchikov metrics. 
These connections are defined by "minimal subtraction"
of divergences in the regularization constant.

Given a conformal field theory, it is 
in general quite hard to make 
global statements about the family of conformal field theories, 
generated by perturbation with a given set of exactly marginal
fields. This is due to the  
fact that information on the CFT structures in points of the family
have to be more or  
less completely reconstructed out of the structures at one point (the
point corresponding 
to the CFT which is being perturbed), by means of perturbation
theory. Thus, one gets perturbative results only, and perturbation
theory usually becomes technically difficult at higher orders.

However, in the case of perturbations by products of holomorphic and
antiholomorphic currents, there is in fact enough structure to make
exact global statements about the families of CFTs generated by them
using first order perturbation theory only. 

In it was shown that tensor products of fields of
holomorphic and antiholomorphic currents are exactly marginal, if and
only if they form abelian current algebras  
,  respectively, and that in this case 
the deformations generated by them preserve the corresponding current
algebras  and . 
Thus these deformations give rise to families of conformal field theories with 
 and  contained in their holomorphic and
antiholomorphic -algebras. 
Moreover, the tangent vectors to the families in every point are given
by products of currents, 
whose CFT-properties are known independently of the actual CFT. Thus
the derivatives of the CFT-structures can be calculated in every point
of the families and can then be integrated up. 

Assuming that the Hilbert spaces of the conformal field theories in
the families decompose into -highest weight
representations as in decomp  
_(Q,Q ) _QQ  
_Q _Q  .
it is shown in the following that these deformations only affect the
- 
representations, while the OPE-coefficients of -highest
weight states are
parallel with respect to the connection . 
To be more precise, the only effect of the deformations will be 
-transformations of the charge lattices 
.  From this it follows
in particular that the corresponding deformation spaces are given by
defspace  
adefspace 
D _(a,a ) O (d,d )_0/(O (d)O (d ))_0
O (d,d )/O (d)O (d ). 
Let us first of all calculate the covariant derivatives of the modes
of the - and -currents and holomorphic and
antiholomorphic energy-momentum tensors 
defined by
j^(z)=_n z^n-1 j_n^ ,
 ^  (z )=
_n z ^n-1  _n^  ,
 
T(z)=_n z^n-2 L_n,T (z )=_n z ^n-2 L _n,where, as in section   and
 are basis of  and
 respectively,  
and we denote the generators of the deformations by

.   
By the definition of , 
can be expressed as 
D_O ^   j_n^C(0) d z
    2i z^-n  _P^1D_(z)     d ^2w  O_  (w,w )j^(z)]_,
where  is the regularization parameter and 
 means the regularization independent part of .
Using the OPE currentalg  this can be expressed as
D_O ^   j_n^&=&
[_C(0) d z2i z^-n 
  _C_(z) d w -2i   
kK^  ^  (w )(z-w) ]_

&=&
[_C_(0) d w 2i  
kK^  ^  (w ) 
_C(w) d z2i z^-n (z-w) 
]_

&=&
[_C_(0) d w 2i  
kK^  ^  (w ) w^-n 
]_

&=&
-k K^  _0^  _n,0 .The same kind of arguments lead to 
D_O ^   L_n^[_C(0) d z2i z^-n  _P^1    D_(z) d ^2w  
O_  (w,w )T(z)]_=-j_n^ _0^  
and similar expressions for the modes of . Altogether we find
dermodes 
D_O ^   j^_n=
-k K^ _n,0  ^  _n,D_O ^   L_n=
-j_n^ _0^  ,

D_O ^    ^  _n=
-kK ^   
_n,0 j^_n,D_O ^   L _n=
-j_0^ _n^  .Thus, the --algebra structure is
parallel with respect  
to , and only the -charges(As noted above,
  we assume the zero modes of the  
currents to be diagonalizable on .)  change under the deformations.
Their covariant derivatives can be read off from dermodes 
defcharges 
D_c_  O ^   (Q^,
Q ^  )= 
-(c_^  Q^,c^_  
Q ^  ), 
which are transformations  
in . This characterizes
completely the deformations of the
--algebra structures of the CFTs. 
Moreover the -highest weight property and
the decomposition of the Hilbert space decomp  are preserved under
the deformations, which means in  
particular that we only have to assume decomp  for one CFT in the families.

To show that this is in fact the only effect of the deformation on the
CFT structures, 
we have to show, that the OPE of -highest
weight vectors is not deformed. Now, the covariant derivative of
correlation functions of those vectors is given by
defope 
&&D_O ^   _1(z_1,z _1)
_n(z_n,z _n)
 
&&=[_P^1_i D_(z_i)  d ^2w
  O ^   
_1(z_1,z _1)_n(z_n,z _n)]_

&&=_i,j Q_i^Q _j^  
_1(z_1,z _1)_n(z_n,z _n)[_P^1_i D_(z_i) -1    (w-z_i)(w -z _j) ]_


&&=-2_i<j Q_i^Q _j^  ln(z_i-z_j^2)
_1(z_1,z _1)_n(z_n,z _n)

&&=(D_O ^    
ln(_i<j 
(z_i-z_j)^2(Q_i,Q_j) (z _i-z _j)^2 (Q _i,
  Q _j) ))


&&_1(z_1,z _1)_n(z_n,z _n).But the -term in the last line of defope  is just the logarithm of
the corresponding -, -conformal block. 
Thus, the correlation functions are deformed only through the 
conformal blocks and the OPE-coefficients of
-highest weight states 
are parallel.

Thus, the effect of current-current deformations on the conformal
field theory structure is completely characterized by the deformations
of the charges described above.  

In particular from defcharges  it follows that the base manifold
of the family of CFTs  
generated by current-current deformations is indeed given by adefspace . 

Let us finish with a comment on another connection .
In the discussion above, we used connections  on the Hilbert space
bundles over the deformation spaces, which were defined by minimal
subtraction. With respect to these connections operators from the
-algebras are parallel except zero modes of the current algebra.
For the discussion of e.g. boundary conditions other connections
 will be useful. These are defined by(In fact they
  are nothing else  
than the connections  from,
which are obtained by a regularization scheme consisting of cutting
out radius one  
disks around the punctures of the surfaces.) 
D _O _   :=D_O _   -
_n0 1n j_n^ _n^  .
They satisfy
tildedermodes 
D _O ^   j^_n=
-k K^  ^  _-n ,D _O ^   L_n=
-_m j_m+n ^ _m^  ,

D _O ^    ^  _n=
-kK ^   
j^_-n ,D _O ^   L _n=
-_m j_m^ _m+n ^  ,and thus for all , the parallel transport of
 
is given by the vector representation of .

As the connections , also  restrict to the
Levi-Civita-connection on the 
tangent bundle of the deformation space equipped with the Zamolodchikov metric.
