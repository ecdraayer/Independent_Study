We show that for classical gauge theories with sources, an initial
lump of gauge and matter fields evolves into either a lump of matter
fields with no gluonic content or a configuration where the gauge and
matter fields are periodic in time.

 

Constraints imposed by requiring non-radiating asymptotic behavior
restrict the form of classical solutions (solitons or lumps) in gauge
theories with sources. While these solitons are expected to be highly
complicated objects, we will still be able to find general results by
placing mild requirements on the fields.

Despite their non-linearity pure Yang-Mills fields do not hold
themselves together to give finite-energy solutions that are either
time-independent or periodic in time
. An even stronger result was proved: the only
finite-energy non-singular non-radiating solutions with arbitrary time
dependence are vacuum solutions . This "no-go"
theorem forbids the existence of classical glueballs in a pure
Yang-Mills system. The presence of sources changes this situation. In
this note we investigate conditions which are imposed on the
energy-momentum of gauge fields by the existence of such classical
lumps. The result is applicable to a wide class of gauge theories. Our
particular interest  is in glueballs in QCD, where
the  gauge fields couple to quarks and confinement is
involved.  This work is a zeroth order analysis towards understanding
this complete physical situation.

We consider classical field theory with the Lagrangian density L =-1 4 F^a_ F_a^ +L _mwhich
includes gauge fields  via field strengths 
together with the matter fields via  (In QCD or
the Standard Model  depends on vectors, scalars, and
spin- fermions in such a way that  is
renormalizable. However, the results given here are classical, so we
need not require renormalizability.) ; our metric is .  The
explicit form of the functional  will not be needed.

We will be interested in the part of the energy-momentum tensor for
the gauge fields alone . In terms of electric 
and magnetic  fields, the
components of this symmetric tensor are
&&_A^00 =1 2 (E^a_i E^a_i+H^a_i H^a_i),    
_A^0i =^ijk E^a_j
H^a_k,
&&_A^ij =1 2 ^ij (E^a_k E^a_k+H^a_k
H^a_k)-E^ai  E^aj -H^ai  H^aj .
is traceless, as in the sourceless case, but it is not conserved,
, when the matter
currents  are present.

It is useful to study the time and radial dependence of the quantities
G^(t,R)=_rR ^3xf(r)_A^0 ,where . Taking the time derivative of (), we
find _0 G^(t,R)=_rR ^3x(f J^a_A 
F^ _a+_A^i _i f)-_r=R ^2 S_i
f_A^i .The only requirements imposed on the
time-independent scalar function  is that the integral in
Eq. () converges and that the surface term in Eq. ()
can be ignored (Instead of the scalar function  we
could have used higher tensor moments  with
a similar result.) .

For now we restrict our attention to lumps at rest; we can choose a
frame such that this is the case for any lump moving slower than the
speed of light. To be localized, non-radiating fields of lumps at rest
must have an asymptotic behavior _r r^3/2+ F^a_ (t,x )=0,which is uniform in time (For a lump
at rest, outside of a sphere with the radius independent  of
time, fields approach their asymptotic values with a given accuracy
for all  times. This guarantees absence of the outgoing
radiation . For a lucid discussion of uniform
convergence see R. Courant, Differential and Integral Calculus 
(Interscience, New York, 1937).) ; here
. Likewise, matter fields do not radiate their
energy away when their currents satisfy a similar limit _r r^5/2+  J^a_A (t,x )=0,which also must be uniform in time.

As a result of these assumptions, for a sphere of large radius ,
the surface term vanishes and the right-hand side of Eq. ()
goes uniformly in time to K^(t)=^3x(f J^a_A 
F^ _a+_A^i _i f).This means that
for any positive  there exists a time-independent 
 such that for any  we have _0
G^(t,R)-K^(t)<for all . For such ,
G^(t,R)-G^(0,R)-_0^tt'K^(t')<t.On the other hand, from the properties of the energy-momentum tensor,
Eq. (), we deduce  and so
 is bounded, G^(t,R)_rR f(r)_t0 E_A(t,R)=(R);
being the energy of the gauge fields inside the sphere of radius
.  is a time-independent and bounded function of .

Without a detailed form for the function  we cannot conclude
whether the bounds imposed on the function  are consistent
or inconsistent. There are, however, simple cases where inconsistency
is obvious:  
When  diverges as  tends to infinity,
Eqs. () and () cannot possibly be true
simultaneously.
If for large ,  approaches a nonzero constant
, the integral in Eq. () asymptotically
approaches . If we now choose
, then bounds () and
() still cannot be consistent for all  since
 is finite (see Figure ). It follows that the
only resolution is to set . Since the function 
in Eq. () is general (up to satisfying the requirements
described above), we conclude that the gauge fields must
asymptotically approach zero as  increases.  From the equations of
motion it then follows that the matter currents approach zero as
well. Note, since the matter currents  vanish for the pure matter
Lagrangian, our conclusion does not limit the form of pure matter
solitons. For example,  is not required.
If for large , the function  approaches a periodic
function with oscillations around a constant , we
similarly conclude that , otherwise () and
() are again violated, and it follows that for large 
the gauge fields and the matter currents must periodically oscillate
around zero. Consequently, the matter fields becomes periodic in time
for large . As a result, an initial lump of gauge
and matter fields can evolve either into a lump of matter fields with
no gluonic content (this means, in particular, that there cannot be
finite-energy time-independent classical glueballs, even if we include
matter), or into a time-periodic configuration of gauge and matter
fields.  For pure Yang-Mills theory, the role of  is played
by the conserved total energy, and our result reproduces Coleman's
conclusion in Ref. .



 
For  the bound () is valid and ()
is not. 


We now turn to the case of lumps moving with the speed of light and
modify the argument in Ref.  to include
sources. By choosing the 3-axis in the direction of the momentum, we
make the fields transverse with their components related by
. In terms of light-cone
variables , the only non-vanishing components of
the field-strength are . Since , we
can perform a gauge transformation depending on  and  to set
 and  to zero. From  it now follows that
 is independent of  and , so we make a gauge
transformation depending on  to set . Next, from the
equations of motion we find  and &&^_A_+=J_A+ ,
&&^+_A_++[A^+,_A_+]=-J_A .Eq. () follows from
Eq. () by differentiation and using covariant conservation of
the current. We are left with only Eq. () to solve and its
general solution is A_+(x^+,x^1,x^2)=A _+(x^+,x^1,x^2)
+1 4 ^1^2J_A+ (x^+,^1,^2)
[(x^1-^1) ^2+(x^2-^2) ^2],
where  is a solution 
to the Laplace equation . It is well
known that the only non-singular solution to this equation is a
function  of  alone. For a non-singular
current, the second term in Eq. () can have a singularity
only at infinity. For large , the second term in
Eq. () is asymptotically , where
I=^1^2J_A+ =_C(F_+2 ^1-F_+1 ^2),and  is an infinite contour in the  plane, which
encloses the sources. Observe that the contour integral form for 
is the gauge field flux in the transverse plane. Fields are
non-singular only when the transverse flux vanishes, . The
asymptotic behavior in Eq. () ensures this. Thus we cannot
eliminate, but can constrain the form of lumps moving with the speed
of light.

To summarize, only specific types of localized solutions can exist in
classical gauge theories with sources: either they are periodic in
time or only matter fields are present for large . Also, we have
found only mild restrictions on massless solutions. These conclusions
were reached for classical systems and they do not restrict forms of
possible quantum lumps; in fact, periodic solutions are just what one
would expect for stationary quantum states.
