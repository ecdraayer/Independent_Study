We investigate the spatially inhomogeneous decay of an unstable
D-brane and construct an asymptotic solution which describes a
codimension one D-brane and the tachyon matter in boundary string
field theory.
In this solution, the tachyon matter exists around the
lower-dimensional D-brane.
Introduction 
Time dependent solutions of tachyon have been vigorously investigated
recently. One of the purpose is to study the decay of an unstable
D-brane. It was shown in that unstable D-branes
become the pressure-less gas with non-zero energy density at late
time, which is called tachyon matter, if the tachyon rolls down to
the bottom of the potential homogeneously.
While the time dependent solution is described by the boundary
state, effective field theory approaches give similar results.
The Born-Infeld type effective field theory-reproduces the known results of the rolling tachyon.
In, the spatially homogeneous decay was analyzed by
using boundary string field theory (BSFT)-.
They gave the asymptotic solution ,
which reproduces the property of the tachyon matter.
Since the unstable D-brane can decay into D-brane, it is
interesting to consider the spatially inhomogeneous tachyon which
represents the time evolution of the kink solution. In this paper, we
study the behavior of the spatially inhomogeneous decay of an unstable
D-brane in BSFT and give an asymptotic solution.
As we will see later, this solution asymptotically approaches
(: sign-function),
and the lower-dimensional D-brane appears with the tachyon matter.

This paper is organized as follows. In section , we
consider the inhomogeneous decay of an unstable D-brane and construct
the asymptotic solution which describes both the lower-dimensional
D-brane and the tachyon matter. Then we briefly discuss how the
energy concentrates to make the lower-dimensional D-brane in section
.
The final section is devoted to conclusion and discussion.

Inhomogeneous decay of the unstable D-brane In this section, we consider the late time behavior of the decaying
D-brane into the lower-dimensional D-brane in
BSFT.(Inhomogeneous rolling tachyon has been discussed also
in-.) 
The action is given by(We set  for simplicity and
the signature of the metric is taken to be .
This action is exact as long as  and higher
derivative corrections are difficult to examine in BSFT.
Since some reliable results have been obtained in and
other papers, we neglect the higher derivative terms and proceed to
investigate.)  
where
 
and  is the tension of a non-BPS D-brane.
The energy-momentum tensor obtained from this action is
 
Note that the energy-momentum conservation and the equation of motion
are related as
 

In order that the codimension one D-brane,(We take
the codimension one D-brane to be localized transverse to
-direction.)  i.e. kink solution, will be developed finally, we
set the initial condition at  as
 
and we also impose that the initial value of the tachyon field is very
small, i.e.  at . Having imposed the initial
conditions, we expect that  for  and
 for  at late time and the kink solution is
dynamically generated. Due to the energy conservation, it is natural
to expect that some non-zero energy density remains in the infinite
region as well.(A possibility that the energy
dissipates to infinity is excluded as will be shown in section
.) 

Since we are interested in the inhomogeneity transverse to the
codimension one D-brane,
we put  for . Then the action becomes
 
where
 
The hamiltonian density is
 
Let us investigate the equation of motion,
 
We assume that  does not cross the singularity at 
and restrict ourselves to , where  is analytic.

First, let us consider that  goes to some finite value other than
, i.e. does not hit a singularity as .
Since we treat the case where  as ,
the leading contribution to the equation of motion () leads
to (cf. ref.)
 
This equation has no solutions for finite values of  because
 is positive in  and it is also
positive for  since it can be written in that region as
 
In the case of , we obtain the same equation
as eq.()
because the asymptotic forms of  and  for the
argument  being large are given by
 
And we see that  is a solution for eq.().

Next, we proceed to the case that  as .
We may write ,  at late
time, and assume .
Then we see that  and .
Since ,  and  behave near  as
 
the leading contribution of eq.() in this case becomes
 
which leads to, due to eq.(),
 
Solving this equation, we obtain the leading term of  as
 
where  is a function of .(
The  case corresponds to the  in.) 
Note that eqs.() and () implies finite energy
density at late time.
We stress here that the equation of motion requires that  goes to
either  or infinity as , which generally holds
when we consider the rolling tachyon.
The static solution which represents the codimension one D-brane is
 () and the spatially homogeneous
solution for the rolling tachyon is  as
. Thus, considering the above analysis of
the equation of motion, we require that the asymptotic solution
satisfies
 

Let us construct the solution describing the decay of
an unstable D-brane into the lower-dimensional one.
We expect the asymptotic solution for  as
 
where  is a small perturbation and 
is a function which satisfies
 

First, we consider the asymptotic behavior of the tachyon
for .
In this region,  and hence .
We have
 
where use has been made of eq.() and we have assumed
that  and  are small.
We also require, at late time,
 
Thus, in order to satisfy eq.(), or obtain the finite
energy solution,  is given by
 
where  is a function of  and we assume that it does not
vary so much. Then we have
 
We shall proceed to .
 From eqs.(), () and (),
the difference, , should damp more rapidly
than  at late time. Thus we find that 
can be given by
 
where  is a positive constant and  is a constant, which can
be taken positive without lost of generality. Although we write
the asymptotic form of  as eq.(), note that  is
correct up to  except the infinitesimally
small region around .

Next, we consider the behavior of the tachyon at the remaining point,
i.e.  as  with the above 
()  and  ().
At this point we first notice  due to eq.().
Also we find that 
while , and hence .
The asymptotic forms of  and  for
the argument  being large are given in eq.().
Hence at exactly , we find the following behavior for
,
 
Let us calculate more carefully. In the infinitesimally small region
around  for ,  in eq.() and its
derivatives are evaluated as
 
Of course, this satisfies leading contribution of
eq.(),(The leading term of the equation of motion
is also satisfied at .)  and eq.() leads to
 
 From eqs.() and (),
we find that the hamiltonian density asymptotically becomes
 
where
 
This shows the correct tension  of the
D-brane at . The non-zero energy density remains
and the pressure for
 is given by plugging eqs.() and
() into
 
It is easy to check that the pressure falls off exponentially at late
time. Thus, this non-zero energy density turns out to be the tachyon
matter.

Flow of energy Having found the asymptotic solution, we consider the momentum
density, or the flow of energy in this section.
Eq.() leads to
 
We see that  at . From eqs.(), ()
and (),  and  at late time except for 
are given by
 
The remaining factor of  at late time is given in the
previous section, so that it is easy to see that the energy ceases to
flow at , which is, of course, consistent with the
energy-momentum conservation.
Note that if , or  is constant, we cannot obtain
explicit form of  since eqs.() and
( ) is
correct up to . However, we see that
 is smaller than ,
which does not alter the above result at .

Although the flow of the energy at early time is not given,
since we consider the time evolution of the kink, it is plausible that
,  and  in some
region around  and hence the energy flows toward  in
some region around there after some finite time, which means that the
energy does not dissipate to infinity.
We note that
the energy conservation implies 
if  is small.

Conclusion and discussion 
We have investigated the spatially inhomogeneous decay of an unstable
D-brane in boundary string field theory.
We have considered the equation of motion and
shown that  must become either  or infinity as .
We have also given the time dependent kink solution of tachyon
eq.() with eqs.(), () at late time.
We found that the final state is the codimension one D-brane and
the tachyon matter, the pressure-less gas with non-zero energy density.
Furthermore, the energy (density) where the resultant codimension
D-brane exists is  which exactly corresponds to the tension
of the codimension one D-brane, .
Recently the inhomogeneous rolling tachyon of a different profile has
been analyzed in CFT approach. It is interesting to study
the relation to our analysis.

Finally we comment on the excitation of gauge fields.
In, gauge fields in the rolling tachyon was studied.
We can perform a similar analysis with the rolling tachyon studied
here and we find that the excitations of the gauge field can
exist only on the lower-dimensional D-brane, while there are no
excitations on the remaining tachyon matter.
