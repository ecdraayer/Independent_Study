We consider multidimensional gravitational models with a nonlinear
scalar curvature term and  form fields in the action functional.
In our scenario it is assumed that   the higher dimensional
spacetime undergoes a spontaneous compactification to a warped
product manifold. Particular attention is paid to models with
quadratic scalar curvature terms and a Freund-Rubin-like ansatz
for solitonic form fields. It is shown that for certain parameter
ranges the extra dimensions are stabilized. In particular,
stabilization is possible for any sign of the internal
 space curvature,   the bulk cosmological constant and of the
effective four-dimensional cosmological constant.  Moreover, the
effective cosmological constant can satisfy the observable limit
on the dark energy density. Finally, we discuss the restrictions
on the parameters of the considered nonlinear models and how they
 follow from the connection between the D-dimensional and the
four-dimensional fundamental
 mass scales.

Introduction 


Two of the most intriguing problems of modern cosmology are the
problem of additional dimensions and the cosmological constant
problem (CCP). The first problem follows from theories which unify
different fundamental interactions with gravity, such as M/string
theory, and which have their most consistent
formulation in spacetimes with more than four dimensions. The
problem can be naturally formulated  as the following question: if
we live in a multidimensional spacetime, why do we not observe the
extra dimensions?  Within the "old" Kaluza-Klein (KK) framework
and the early -heterotic string phenomenology the
question is answered by assuming the extra dimensions so small
(i.e. with a characteristic size  between the Planck and the
Fermi scales cm cm) that
they are not accessable by present-day collider experiments. New
concepts with the possibility for rich phenomenology opened up
with the uncovering of branes by Polchinski in
1995. In "brane-world" scenarios of the Universe  the usual
dimensional physics with its 
standard model (SM) fields is localized on a dimensional
space-like hypersurface (our world-brane) whereas the
gravitational field propagates in the whole (bulk) spacetime.
Depending on the concrete scenario there are different types of
masking of the additional dimensions. Whereas in
Arkani-Hamed-Dvali-Dimopoulos (ADD) models
 the extra dimensions are
curled up to sizes smaller than cm, so that they are in
agreement with present table-top Cavendish-type tests of gravity
, they can be infinite
 in the Randall-Sundrum II (RS II) and the
Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model. In the latter
models the appearing four-dimensionality of low-energy physics is
achieved by inducing appropriate effective gravitational potentials
 on the world-brane.  Beside their interesting phenomenology, brane-world
models provide a possible resolution of the hierarchy problem. In
ADD-type models this is due to the connection between the
 Planck scale  and the fundamental scale
 of the dimensional and the
(4+)-dimensional spacetime, respectively:
0.1 
M_Pl(4) ^2 V_D^  
M_*(4+D^ ) ^2+D^   .

 denotes the volume of the compactified
 extra dimensions. It was realized in
 that  localizing the SM
fields on a brane allows to lower  down
to the electroweak scale TeV without contradiction
with present observations. Therefore, the compactification scale
of the internal space can be of order

0.2  r V_D^  ^1/D^   10^32 D^  -17  cm  . 
With TeV, physically acceptable values correspond
to  (for astrophysical and
cosmological bounds see e.g.; experimental
bounds from table-top Cavendish-type experiments are given in
), and for  one arrives at a
sub-millimeter compactification scale  of
the internal space. If we shift  to TeV,
as suggested in (see also), then
the  case satisfies all aforementioned bounds and
leads to  . In order to not
exclude this  with its largest possible
compactification scale , we assume that the fundamental scale
 can be of order TeV. Additionally, the
geometry in the ADD approach is assumed to be factorizable as in a
standard Kaluza-Klein  model. I.e., the topology is the direct
product of a non-warped external spacetime manifold and internal
space manifolds with warp factors which depend on the external
coordinates(The M-theory inspired RS-scenarios
 use a non-factorizable geometry with 
. Here, the dimensional spacetime is warped with a factor
 which depends on the extra dimension and Eq.
0.1  is modified as: .
In our paper we concentrate on the factorizable geometry of
ADD-type models.) .

According to observations, the internal space should be static or
nearly static at least from the time of primordial
nucleosynthesis, (otherwise the fundamental physical constants
would vary, see e.g.). This means that at the
present evolutionary stage of the Universe  the compactification
scale of the internal space should either be stabilized and
trapped at the minimum of some effective potential, or it should
be slowly varying (similar to the slowly varying cosmological
constant in the quintessence scenario). In both cases,
small fluctuations over stabilized or slowly varying
compactification scales (conformal scales/geometrical moduli) are
possible.


Stabilization of extra dimensions (moduli stabilization) in models
with large extra dimensions (ADD-type models) has been considered
in a number of papers (see e.g., Refs.
)(In
most of these papers, moduli stabilization was  considered without
regard to the energy-momentum localized on the brane so that the
dynamics of the multidimensional universe was mainly defined by
the energy-momentum of the bulk matter. A brane matter
contribution was taken into account, e.g., in.) . In the
corresponding approaches, a product topology of the 
dimensional bulk spacetime was constructed from Einstein
spaces with scale (warp) factors depending only on the coordinates
of the external dimensional component. As a consequence, the
conformal excitations had the form of massive scalar fields living
in the external spacetime. Within the framework of
multidimensional cosmological models (MCM) such excitations were
investigated in where they were called
gravitational excitons. Later, since the ADD

compactification approach these geometrical moduli excitations are
 known as radions.

Most of the aforementioned  papers are devoted to the
stabilization of large extra dimension in theories with a linear
multidimensional gravitational action. String theory suggests that
the usual linear Einstein-Hilbert action should be extended with
higher order nonlinear curvature terms. In a previous paper
 we considered a simplified model with
multidimensional Lagrangian of the form , where 
is an arbitrary smooth function of the scalar curvature. Without
connection to stabilization of the extra-dimensions, such models
(dimensional as well as multi-dimensional ones) were
considered  e.g. in Refs.. There, it was
shown that the nonlinear models are equivalent to models with
linear gravitational action plus a minimally coupled scalar field
with self-interaction potential. In, we advanced
this equivalence towards investigating the stabilization problem
for extra dimensions. Particular attention was paid to models with
quadratic scalar curvature terms. It was shown that for certain
parameter ranges, the extra dimensions are stabilized if the
internal spaces have negative constant curvature. In this case,
the 4-dimensional effective cosmological constant 
as well as the bulk cosmological constant  become
negative. As a consequence, the homogeneous and isotropic external
space is asymptotically . Because the considered
nonlinear model is a pure geometrical one (only with a bare
cosmological constant  as an exotic matter source
included) the equivalent linear model contains only a minimally
coupled scalar field as bulk matter. The null energy condition
(NEC)  for this field reads 
 (with  a future directed null
vector) and is satisfied only marginally when the internal spaces
are completely stabilized and the scalar field is frozen out.
Moreover, the weak energy condition (WEC) 
(with  a future directed time-like vector) is violated in this
case because the energy density  of the scalar field is
negative definite . As a result, the aforementioned
parameters (the internal space scalar curvatures,  and
) are negative in the case of stabilized internal
spaces (see also).

However, a negative cosmological constant leads to a deceleration
of the Universe instead to an accelerated expansion, as recent
observational data indicate. According to these data our Universe
 is dominated by a dark energy component with
negative pressure. For example, from observations of the clusters
of galaxies follows that the energy density of the matter
components which can clump in various structures is significantly
undercritical. But, the position of the first acoustic peak in the
angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background
radiation (CMB) implies that the Universe is, on large scales,
nearly flat. In other words, the energy density in the Universe is
very close to the critical value. Thus, there must exist a
homogeneously distributed exotic (dark) energy component
. This observation is in agreement with the conclusion
following from the Hubble diagram of type Ia supernovae (SN-Ia) at
high redshifts, which also indicate that our Universe  currently
undergoes an accelerated expansion. Under the assumption of
flatness, using the data of the  CMB anisotropy measurements, high
redshift SN-Ia observations and from local cluster abundances, the
authors of Ref. found a constraint on the equation
of state parameter  at 68 of
confidence level. They concluded that this result is in perfect
agreement with the  cosmological constant case and
gives no support to a quintessential field scenario with 
. Results obtained in also favor 
 at the present epoch.

In Ref. we already indicated that the effective
cosmological constant can be shifted from negative values to
positive ones by including into the nonlinear model matter fields
which satisfy the NEC. In the present paper, we demonstrate this
effect explicitly by endowing the extra dimensions with
real-valued solitonic form fields. Such fields
naturally arise as Ramond-Ramond (RR) form fields in type II
string theory
 and  M-theory. Within a generalized Freund-Rubin
setting their influence on the evolutionary dynamics of
the Universe has been considered, e.g., in Refs.
 and due to its simplicity we adopt
this ansatz here for the stability analysis of our nonlinear
model.  From Eqs. 1.6 , 1.7  below, it can be easily seen
that the real-valued form fields satisfy the NEC as well as the
WEC. However, the strong energy condition (SEC) is violated in our
model by the cosmological constant(For a critical
discussion of the different ECs we refer to.) . The
presence of two types of fields in our equivalent linear model -
the minimally coupled scalar field (which satisfies the NEC only
marginally and which can violate the WEC) and the form fields
(which satisfy both of these conditions)
-  leads to a rich and interesting picture of stable
configurations with various sign combinations for the allowed
cosmological constants as well as for the constant curvatures of
the internal space. Beside stability regions with negative
4-dimensional effective cosmological constant 
the parameter space contains also regions with 
which can ensure an accelerated expansion of the Universe.

As mentioned at the very beginning of the Introduction, there
still remains the problem about the incredible smallness of the
cosmological constant. Moreover, it is
completely unclear why its energy density is comparable with the
energy density of matter just at the present time (the cosmic
coincidence problem). Modern reviews on the cosmological constant
problem can be found for example in.
In our paper we show that for stabilized internal spaces a small
positive cosmological constant of the external (our) space can
arise from ADD- and KK-type multidimensional models. We
demonstrate that the smallness of the effective cosmological
constant can follow from a natural parameter choice of the
considered nonlinear ansatz. Unfortunately, the extremely small
value of the observed cosmological constant
 requires a very strong
fine tuning of the parameters.





The paper is structured as follows. The general setup of our model
is given in section . In section , we make
the geometry of the spacetime manifold explicit - endowing the
internal space with the structure of a warped product of 
factor spaces (due to spontaneous compactification). Furthermore,
we specify the generalized Freund-Rubin ansatz for the form fields
and perform a dimensional reduction of the action functional to a
4-dimensional effective theory with  self-interacting
minimally coupled scalar fields (section ). The
stabilization of the extra dimensions is then reduced to the
condition that the obtained effective potential for these fields
should have a minimum. In section , we present a
detailed analysis of this problem for a model with one internal
space. The main results are summarized and discussed in the
concluding section .




General setup 

We consider a  - dimensional nonlinear gravitational
theory with action

1.1  S = 1 2_D^2 _M d^Dx g 
f(R) -12 _M d^Dx g _i=1 ^n
1 d_i!  (F^(i)  )^2 , 
where  is an arbitrary smooth function with mass
dimension   ( has the unit of mass) of the
scalar curvature  constructed from the
D-dimensional metric .

1.1a   ^2_D = 8/
M_*(4+D^ ) ^2+D^  
denotes the D-dimensional gravitational constant (subsequently,
we
 assume that ). In action
 1.1 ,

 is an
antisymmetric tensor field of rank  (a form field
strength) with indices from an index set 
, where 
.
 For simplicity, we suppose that the index sets , 
of tensors ,  with   contain no common
elements as well as no indices corresponding to the coordinates of
the dimensional external spacetime (usually ).
Additionally, we assume that for the sum of the ranks holds
. Obviously, this model
can be generalized to tensor configurations , 
with intersecting (overlapping) index sets. In this case explicit
field configuration can be obtained, e.g., when the indices
satisfy special overlapping rules. Such a
generalization is beyond the scope of the present paper.
Furthermore, we assume in our subsequent considerations that the
index sets  do not contain the
coordinates of the external spacetime  and, hence, the field
strengths  can be associated with a magnetic (solitonic)
brane system
 located in the extra dimensions as
discussed, e.g., in Refs..


The equation of motion for the gravitational sector of 1.1 
reads

1.2  f^ R_ab  -12 f g_ab  - _a _b f^  + g_ab   
f^  = _D^2T_ab  [ F,g]  , 
where , , 
, . 
and  denote the covariant derivative and the
Laplacian with respect to the metric 

1.3    = [g] = g^ab _a _b = 1 g  
_a ( g g^ab 
_b ) .

Eq. 1.2  can be rewritten in the form

1.4  f^ G_ab  +12 g_ab  ( R
f^  - f) - _a _b f^  +
g_ab    f^  = _D^2T_ab  [
F,g] , 
where , and
its trace

1.5  (D-1)  f^  = D 2  f
-f^ R + _D^2T[ F,g]  
 can be considered as a connection between  and . The
energy momentum tensor (EMT)  is
defined in the standard way as

1.6  T_ab [ F,g] 1g  (g  _i=1 ^n
1 d_i! (F^(i)  )^2)  g^ab  
= _i=1 ^n T_ab [ F^(i) ,g] , 
where 1.7  T_ab [ F^(i) ,g] =
1d_i! (-12g_ab  F^(i) _m_i n_i q_i F^(i) m_i n_i q_i  + d_i F^(i) _a n_iq_i F_b^(i) n_iq_i ) . 

For the trace of this tensor we obtain

1.8  T[ F,g] = _i=1 ^n T[ F^(i) ,g] 
with

1.9  T[ F^(i) ,g] =
2d_i-D 2(d_i!) F^(i) _m_i n_iq_i  F^(i) m_i
n_iq_i  . 
The field strengths   satisfy the equations of motion

1.10  F^(i) m_i n_i q_i  _; q_i  = 0
1g   ( g 
F^(i) m_i n_i q_i )_, q_i =0 , i=1,,n . 
and the Bianchi identities

1.11  F^(i) _[m_i n_i q_i , a]  = 0 , i=1,,n . 

Following Refs., we perform a conformal
transformation

1.12  g_ab  = ^2 g_ab   
with

1.13  = [ f'(R)]^1/(D-2)   
and reduce the nonlinear gravitational theory to a linear one with
additional scalar field. This transformation is well defined for
 (concerning the case  see footnote
). The equivalence of the theories can be easily proven
with the help of the auxiliary formulae

1.14  = ^-2 [  +
(D-2)g^ab ^-1 _,a _b]
  =
^2 [- (D-2) g^ab ^-1  
_,a _b ] , 
1.15  R_ab  = R_ab  +D-1 D-2 ( f')^-2   _a f'  _b f' -(f')^-1   _a  _b f'- 1 D-2  g_ab  (f')^-1    f' 
and

1.16  R = (f')^2/(2-D)  R +D-1 D-2 
(f')^-2  g^ab _a f'_b f'-
2D-1 D-2 (f')^-1    f' . 
Defining the scalar  by the relation
1.19  f' = df d R 
:= e^A   > 0 ,A := D-2 D-1   and
making use of 1.14  - 1.16 , Eqs. 1.4  and 1.5 
can be rewritten as

1.17  G_ab  = ^2_D T_ab [ F,, g] +
T_ab [ ,g] 
and

1.18  = 1 (D-1)(D-2)  
e^-D (D-1)(D-2)    ( D 2  f -
f'R ) + 1(D-1)(D-2)  ^2_D T[
F,,g]  . 
The EMTs read

1.20  T_ab [ ,g] = _,a _,b  -12
g_ab g^mn _,m _,n  - 12 g_ab  e^-D (D-1)(D-2)    (R f'- f) , 
1.21  T_ab [ F,,g] = _i=1 ^n
e^2d_i-D (D-1)(D-2)    T_ab [
F^(i) ,g]

and

1.22  T[ F,,g] = _i=1 ^n
e^2d_i-D (D-1)(D-2)    T[
F^(i) ,g] ,

where , 
are given by replacing  in Eqs. 1.7 ,
1.9 . The indices of the field strengths  are now
raised and lowered with the metric .

The equations of motion 1.10  for  transform to
1.23 
1g   ( g 
e^2d_i-D (D-1)(D-2)    F^(i) m_i n_i q_i )_, q_i =0 ,i=1,,n ,
whereas the Bianchi identities 1.11  do not change.


It can be easily checked that Eqs. 1.17 , 1.18  and
1.23  are the equations of motion for the action

1.24  S = 1 2_D^2  _M d^D x g 
 R[g] - g^ab  _,a  _,b  - 2 U()-
^2_D_i=1 ^n 1d_i!  
e^2d_i-D (D-1)(D-2)   F^(i) _m_i n_i q_i  F^(i) m_i n_i q_i  , 
where

1.25  U() := 12 e^- B   [ R ()e^A   - f( R ()) ] , B :=
D (D-1)(D-2)    
and Eq. 1.19  is used to express  as a function of
 : . The scalar field  is the
result and the carrier of the curvature nonlinearity of the
original theory(Thus, for brevity, we shall refer to the
field  as nonlinearity scalar field. 
)  1.1 . Correspondingly, Eq. 1.18  has a two-fold
interpretation. It is the equation of motion for the field 
and at the same time it can be considered as constraint equation
following from the reduction of the nonlinear theory 1.1  to
the linear one 1.24 . Furthermore, we note that in the linear
theory 1.24  the form fields are non-minimally coupled with
the nonlinearity field . (A minimal coupling occurs only for
a model with , , where according to 1.9  the
trace of the form field EMT vanishes.) A comparison of the action
functional  with 1.21  shows that the last term in 1.24 
coincides with the expression for the energy density
 of the solitonic form field (due to
 by the definition of
).


Let us consider what happens if, in some  way, the scalar field
 tends asymptotically to a constant: 
[precisely this situation should hold when the internal space
undergoes a (freezing) stabilization].  From Eq. 1.19  we see
that in this limit the nonlinearity in 1.1  disappears: 

, where ,  
,  and  plays the role of a
cosmological constant. In the case of homogeneous and isotropic
spacetime manifolds, linear purely geometrical theories with
constant term necessarily imply an (A)dS geometry so
that the manifolds are Einstein spaces. In our model, the
additional form fields destroy this asymptotical behavior.
Instead, we obtain from Eqs. 1.5  and 1.4 

1.25a  R -D D-2 c_2 c_1  -
1 c_1 2 D-2  ^2_D _i=1 ^n 
2d_i-D 2(d_i!) (F^(i) )^2_g  
and

1.25b  R_ab  [
-1 D-2 c_2 c_1  - 1 c_1 2 D-2 
^2_D _i=1 ^n  d_i-1 2(d_i!) ( F^(i) 
)^2_g ]g_ab  + 1 c_1 ^2_D
_i=1 ^n  2d_i 2(d_i!) ( F^(i) _a n_i q_i 
F^(i) n_iq_i _b )_g   ,
where the form field product

1.25c  (F^(i) )^2_g  := F^(i) _m_i n_iq_i 
F^(i) m_i n_iq_i 
is defined with respect to the metric . For a
 form field, which asymptotically tends to a constant,
the scalar curvature and the Ricci tensor also approach constant
values.  But whereas  and  are asymptotically connected
by the relation [see Eqs. 1.16 , 1.17  and 1.25a ]

1.25d  R c_1^-2 D-2   R  , 
the Ricci tensor  will not be proportional to the
metric  and, hence, the space will not be Einsteinian.
This is in obvious contrast to a nonlinear model of purely
geometrical type where the stabilization will
result in an asymptotical  spacetime.


In the rest of the paper we consider for simplicity a toy
model(For considerations on higher order corrections to
the gravity sector of M/string theory we refer to.) 
with quadratic curvature term:

1.26  f(R ) = R + R^ 2  - 2_D
,
where the parameter  has dimension .
For this model we obtain

1.27  f'(R )= 1 + 2R = e^A   R
= 1 2  ( e^A   - 1) 
and

1.28  U() = 12 e^-B  [ 1 4 ( e^A   - 1)^2 + 2 _D ] . 
The condition(Obviously, the conformal transformation
1.12 , 1.13  becomes singular when  vanishes.
The transformation itself can be extended from the
  branch to the  branch with the help of an ansatz
  and a corresponding
redefinition of the nonlinearity field : .
As result, one obtains an action functional for the  branch
which differs from action 1.24  for  in its total sign
and in the relative signs of the single terms as well as in the
potential . Most important, for a fixed sign of the
Einstein-Hilbert term the kinetic term of the nonlinearity field
has the correct sign, whereas the kinetic terms of additional
matter fields (in our case the form fields) have the wrong
relative sign. This leads to a set of equations of motions which
differ from 1.17 , 1.18 . For details we refer to
. Unfortunately, the sign switch occurs for all
additional matter fields simultaneously and it is not controllable
for some selected fields separately. Otherwise, it could have
provided a natural mechanism for the generation of a phantom
energy component with equation of state parameter 
(and a corresponding super-acceleration of the observable
Universe) in the sense of.)  
 implies . In the limit 
 the nonlinearity is switched off and the linear theory is
recovered. Correspondingly, it holds  with implication
,  so that also  (in
accordance with Eq. 1.25d ) and .
The corresponding region of weak nonlinearity  is defined by the
condition .











Spontaneous compactification and dimensional reduction  

The simple block-orthogonal structure of the field strength 
shows that there is a preferable scheme for a spontaneous
compactification of the multidimensional spacetime manifold: each
of the form fields  is nested in its own
-dimensional space . Thus, the -dimensional spacetime
 can be endowed with the structure of a warped product manifold

2.1  M M = M_0 M_1 M_n 
with metric

2.2  g=g_ab (X)dX^adX^b=g^(0) +_i=1 ^n g^(i)  . 

The coordinates on the  - dimensional manifold 
(usually interpreted as our -dimensional Universe) are
denoted by  and the corresponding metric by

2.3  g^(0) =g_ ^(0) (x)dx^dx^ . 
Let the internal factor manifolds  be -dimensional
warped Einstein spaces with warp factors 
and metrics

2.4  g^(i) = e^2 ^i (x) 
^(i) _m_in_i (y_i)dy_i^m_i dy_i^n_i  ,
i.e.,

2.5  R_m_in_i [ ^(i) ] =^i_m_in_i ^(i) ,m_i,n_i=1,,d_i
and

2.5a R[ ^(i) ] =^id_iR_i k r_i^-2  , 
where .  The scale 

sets the characteristic size of  (modulo the warp factor
) and can be interpreted as an effective scale
factor of the compact Einstein space  with metric 
and corresponding volume(The volume is well defined for
positive curvature spaces (). For compact negative and zero
curvature spaces (), i.e.  compact hyperbolic spaces
(CHSs)  and tori , we
interpret this volume as scaled volume of the corresponding
fundamental domain ("elementary cell") 
 (see, e.g., and references
therein).  Here ,  are hyperbolic and flat
universal covering spaces, and ,  -
appropriate discrete groups of isometries. Furthermore, we assume
for the scale factors of the metrics 
 with  scaled in such
a way that .
  Thus, the volume 
is mainly defined by . In all three cases (), the
limit  results in an effective decompactification
of the internal space with . In accordance
with Eq. 2.5a , this means that the positive and negative
constant curvature spaces flatten:  . Clearly, for
compact Ricci-flat spaces holds  by definition

We note that the specific metric ansatz 2.2  - 2.4  for
the warped product of Einstein spaces results in a scalar
curvature  which depends only on : 
. Correspondingly, the nonlinearity field  is also a
function only of : .

The conformally transformed metric 1.12  reads

g := g^(0) +_i=1 ^ne^2 ^i(x) ^(i)

conventions where for Riemann spaces holds 
 and

. It can be easily seen that the ansatz 2.9  satisfies
Eq. 1.23  (because  and  depend only on  and the
 factors cancel). The Bianchi identities
1.11  reduce
 to the equations

2.10-a  ( a^d_i _i(x)
f^(i) (x)) x^   = 0
with solutions
2.10 
 f^(i) (x) =
f_i a^d_i _i  , 
where  are the scale factors of the internal
spaces  after conformal transformation 2.6  and
. We choose the scale factors 
dimensionless so that the constants  have dimension
 and 
. With 2.10  the energy density of the
solitonic form field, and correspondingly the last term in action
1.24 , reads

2.11  -T^0_0[F,,g]=12_i=1 ^n 1d_i!  
e^2d_i-D (D-1)(D-2)   F^(i) _m_i n_i q_i  F^(i) m_i n_i q_i  = _i=1 ^n 
e^2d_i-D (D-1)(D-2)   
f_i^2 a_i^2d_i   :=(, )  , 
where for real form fields . Again we see that for
models with   and  this energy density  decouples
from the nonlinearity scalar field : 
.

The fact that ,  and  depend only on 
allows us to perform a dimensional reduction of action 1.24 .
Without loss of generality we set the compactification scales of
the internal spaces  at present time at
. This means that at present time the total volume of
the internal spaces is completely defined by the characteristic
scale factors  (see 2.5b  and footnote V_d ):

2.5c 
 V_D^   _i=1 ^n_M_i d^d_i y ^(i)   _i=1 ^n r_i^d_i  ,

where  is the number of
extra dimensions and  has dimension
. After dimensional reduction action
1.24  reads
2.12 
S&=&12_0^2 _M_0 d^D_0 xg^(0)  
_i=1 ^ne^d_i^i  R[ g^(0) ]
-G_ij g^(0) _^i_^j -g^(0) _  _  .


 && +_i=1 ^n. R[ g^(i) ] e^-2^i -2 U() - 2^2_D (,)  .

where   is the
midisuperspace metric and

2.13  ^2_0 := ^2_D V_D^    
denotes the dimensional (4-dimensional) gravitational
constant. If we take the electroweak scale  and the Planck
scale  as fundamental ones for dimensional (see Eq.
1.1a ) and 4-dimensional spacetimes (
) respectively, then we reproduce Eqs. 0.1  and
0.2 .


Action 2.12  is written in the Brans - Dicke frame. Conformal
transformation to the Einstein frame
2.14  g_ ^(0) = ( _i=1 ^ne^d_i^i )  ^2D_0-2  g_ ^(0)  
yields

2.15  S=12_0^2 _M_0 d^D_0 xg^(0)   R[
g^(0) ] -G_ij g^(0) _^i_^j- g^(0)  
_ _  -2U_eff  (,)
  . 
The tensor components of the midisuperspace metric (target space
metric on  )  , its
inverse metric  and the effective potential are
correspondingly

2.16  G_ij =d_i_ij +1D_0-2 d_id_j
,G^ij =^ij  d_i +12-D  
and

2.17  U_eff (,) =( _i=1 ^n e^d_i^i )  ^-2D_0-2   [ -12_i=1 ^nR_ie^-2^i + U () + ^2_D (,) ]  , 
where  and  are defined
 by Eqs. 1.28  and 2.11 .

A stable compactification of the internal spaces is ensured when
the scale factors of the internal spaces  are frozen at
one of the minima of the effective potential . The value
of the effective potential at the minimum plays the role of the
effective dimensional cosmological constant: 
. Assuming for the
frozen scale factors at present time , we obtain the
non-zero components of the asymptotic Ricci tensor 1.25b  as
2.18curv  R _ &&  g _  ,
 R _m_i n_i &&(+2 c_1 _D^2 f_i^2 _0^2d_i ) g _m_i
n_i  ,where
2.19curv 
:=
-1 D-2 c_2 c_1 
-1 c_1 2 D-2 _D^2_j=1 ^n(d_j-1)f_j^2_0^2d_j 
and . Thus, the
asymptotic multidimensional spacetime is built up from
Einstein-space blocks, but is itself a non-Einsteinian space due
to the additional term in 2.18curv-2 .





Stabilization of the internal space  

Without loss of generality(The difference between a
general model with  internal spaces and the particular one
with  consists in an additional diagonalization of the
geometrical moduli excitations. ) , we consider in the
present section a model with only one -dimensional internal
space. The corresponding action 2.15  reads

3.1  S=12_0^2 _M_0 d^D_0 xg^(0)   R[
g^(0) ] - g^(0)  
_ _  - g^(0)  
_ _  -2U_eff  (,)
  , 
where

3.2  := -d_1(D-2) D_0-2  ^1 
and

3.3  U_eff (,) = e^2d_1 (D-2)(D_0-2)    [ -12 R_1e^2D_0-2 d_1(D-2)   + U () + ^2_D (,) ]  . 
The potential  of the  nonlinearity scalar field is
given by Eq. 1.28  and the energy density 2.11  of the
solitonic form field  reads

3.4  ^2_D (,) =
^2_Df^2_1 e^2d_1-D  (D-1)(D-2)   
e^2d_1(D_0-2) D-2   .

For brevity of the notation, we introduce
3.4-1 
a:=2D_0-2 d_1(D-2)   , &&
b:=2d_1 (D-2)(D_0-2)   ,

 c:= 2d_1-D (D-1)(D-2)   ,&& h:=^2_Df^2_1
so that the effective potential reads
3.4-2 
U_eff =e^b [-12 R_1 e^a +U()+h
e^c e^ad_1   ] .
 From 3.4-1  we see that a real-valued form field 
implies a non-negative . For the rest of
the paper, we continue to work with dimensionless scalar fields
 instead of passing to canonical ones (modulo
): 
 and .
The restoration of the correct dimensionality is obvious.

In order to ensure a stabilization and asymptotical freezing of
the internal space ,  the effective potential should have a
minimum with respect to the scalar field 
3.4-3 
. _  U_eff _extr =0 ,
so that for a minimum position at 
(which corresponds to a compactification
scale  at present time) it should hold
3.4-4 
a+b 2  R_1 =b U()+(ad_1+b)h e^c .
This formula shows that the potential 
must also have a minimum with respect to , because without
stabilization of  the right hand side remains a dynamical
function whereas the left hand side is a constant. This second
extremum condition
3.4-5 
. _  U_eff _extr =0
yields
3.4-6 
.[_ U+hc e^c ]_extr =0.
Additionally, the eigenvalues of the mass matrix of the coupled
field system, i.e. the Hessian of the effective
potential at the minimum position,
3.4-7 
J:=.ccc 
^2_ U_eff 
&&^2_ U_eff 
 

^2_ U_eff 
&&^2_ U_eff  _extr 
should be positive definite
3.4-8 
m^2_1,2 =12[Tr(J)Tr^2(J)-4(J) ]> 0
 .
According to the Sylvester criterion this is
 equivalent to the  conditions
3.4-9 
J_11 >0, J_22 >0, (J)>0.
 From 3.4-7  we see that in the special case of
 the
Hessian is diagonal and the excitation modes of the fields
decouple. The eigenvalues of  coincide in this case with the
masses squared of the scale factor excitations (gravitational
excitons)  and the excitations of
the nonlinearity field .

Let us now analyze the stability conditions 3.4-4 , 3.4-6 
and 3.4-9  explicitly. For this purpose we introduce the
auxiliary notations
3.4-10 
_0:=._extr ,X:=e^A_0 0,
q:=8_D
and rewrite the potentials ,  and the derivatives of
 at a possible minimum position  as
3.4-11 
U_0.U_extr &=&1 8 X^-D D-2  [(X-1)^2+q]
,
 .U_eff _extr &=&-12
R_1+U_0(X)+h X^2d_1-D D-2   ,

._ U_eff _extr &=&-a+b 2 R_1+b
U_0(X) + (d_1 a+b)hX^2d_1-D D-2  =0 ,

._ U_eff _extr &=&1 8 X^-D D-2  
[(2A-B)X^2-2(A-B)X-(q+1)B]+hcX^2d_1-D D-2  =0
,

.^2_ U_eff _extr 
&=&-a^2-b^2 2 R_1-b^2U_0(X)+[(d_1a)^2-b^2]hX^2d_1-D D-2  
,

.^2_ U_eff _extr 
&=&cd_1ahX^2d_1-D D-2   ,

.^2_ U_eff _extr  &=&
1 8 X^-D D-2  [(2A-B)^2X^2-2(A-B)^2X+(q+1)B^2]+c^2hX^2d_1-D D-2  
.(The constants ,  are defined in Eqs. 1.19  and
1.25 , respectively.) We see that, for fixed dimensions 
and , the two equations 3.4-11-3 , 3.4-11-4  describe
a dimensional algebraic variety  in
the dimensional parameter (moduli) space(The
compactification scale (modulus)  of the internal space 
enters   via curvature scalar  (see
Eq. 2.5a ).)  
. On the variety, inequalities
3.4-9  of the Sylvester criterion define then the parameter
region  of stable compactifications. A
natural strategy for extracting detailed information about the
location of this stability region would consist in solving
 3.4-11-4  for  with subsequent
back-substitution of the found roots into the inequalities
3.4-9  and the equation 3.4-11-3 .
In the following consideration we restrict our
attention to the three simplest nontrivial cases which are easy to
handle analytically.




Zero effective cosmological constant:
  


By definition,  we have 
  so that in the particular case
 Eq. 3.4-11-2  yields the additional
constraint
3.4-12 
.U_eff _extr =-12 R_1+U_0(X)+h
X^2d_1-D D-2  =0  .
Combining this constraint with 3.4-11-3  we obtain the
relation
3.4-13 
R_1=2d_1hX^2d_1-D D-2  =2d_1 d_1-1 U_0(X)
which can be used to eliminate the  term
from 3.4-11-4 . As result we arrive at a simple quadratic
equation in  with physically sensible solutions
3.4-14 
 e^A_0  X=  .
With the help of Eqs. 3.4-13 , 3.4-14  and repeated use of
a  substitution-elimination technique, the potential  and the
second derivatives 3.4-11-5  - 3.4-11-7  of the effective
potential can be rewritten in the simpler form
3.4-14b 
U_0(X)=d_1-1 4d_1 X^-2 D-2  (X-1)
and
3.4-15 
 J_11  && .
^2_  U_eff  _extr  = a^2d_1 U_0(X) , 

J_22  && . ^2_  U_eff 
_extr  = B^2 4D^2  X^-2 D-2  
[E X +4(D_0-1)] ,
 J_12  && .
^2_  U_eff  _extr  =
cd_1a d_1-1  U_0(X) ,where 
 for . For the determinant of the Hessian 3.4-7 
we get
3.4-16 
(J) = 1 (d_1-1)  D_0-2 D-1 
U_0(X)X^-2 D-2  [(d_1-2)X +1] .
With the equations 3.4-13  - 3.4-16  at hand, we are well
prepared to explicitly describe the location of the stability
region  in the parameter space . Let us start
with relation 3.4-13 .  From the non-negativity conditions
 and  we immediately conclude
that for stable spaces  it should hold  and
. Furthermore, we see from the latter condition and
the Sylvester criterion ,  [applied to
3.4-15-2  and 3.4-16 ] that for internal spaces of
dimension  the parameter  is restricted to
positive values(Obviously, a negative  would
yield a maximum of the effective potential  instead of a
minimum and our model would become unstable with respect to the
conformal excitations of the internal space. The condition
 is also required in other  models to
ensure tachyon-free configurations. )  
(the limiting case  we discuss below). Finally, we
note that Eq. 3.4-14b  together with  and
 implies  and, hence, we find for  and
 from the roots 3.4-14 : 
 and also .

Summarizing the obtained restrictions, we can describe the part 
 of the parameter space  where the stability
region  of the variety  is located:
3.4-17 
V =(0,_D0,R_10,h0 ,X1)M  .
It remains to clarify what happens in the various limiting cases
when the parameters reach the boundary  .
 
[(L.1.1)] : According to 3.4-14 , this limit
implies , . Because of 
we have to distinguish the two cases  and
. In these limits we obtain 
and , respectively. [(L.1.2)]: The case 
describes the transition to a linear model. Here we have 
 and 
. In this limit, the mass of the -field
excitations tends to infinity 
 and the field itself becomes frozen at the position
. The stabilization of the internal space occurs for
 with the gravexciton masses 
. This is in
accordance with the results of Ref., where a linear
model with monopole terms was considered.
[(L.1.3)]:
Due to 3.4-14  and (L.1.1) this limit implies
,  and  so that according to
3.4-15-3  the excitation masses ,  decouple
  and the gravexciton mass
vanishes .
Hence, the limit  is connected
with a destabilization of the internal space .
The mass of the nonlinearity field excitations 
remains finite  for .
[(L.1.4)] :  From 3.4-13  - 3.4-14b 
we see that this limit of a vanishing form field is connected with
 ,,. Thus the excitations of the
nonlinearity field  decouple from  gravexcitons (
). Simultaneously, because of 
, the internal space  undergoes a
decompactification  and due to  the effective
potential  becomes flat in the direction
(). This means that
the internal space destabilizes, whereas  remains well
behaved with respect to . These results completely confirm
the conclusions of paper for a  nonlinear
gravitational model without form fields where a stabilization is
only possible for .
Finally, we note that for a model with  (and, hence, a
 vanishing trace of the form field EMT)  the
excitations of nonlinearity field  decouple from the
gravexcitons:   because of  in 3.4-1 ,
3.4-15-3 .




Traceless EMT of the form field:
  

The easy handling of nonlinear models with a traceless form-field
EMT as well as of models  with a two-dimensional internal space
 is connected with the structure of Eq. 3.4-11-4 . For
,  we obtain from Eqs. 3.4-1 ,
3.4-11-4  and the definitions of  and :
3.5 
1 8 [(D-4)X^2+4X-(q+1)D]+(2d_1-D)hX^2d_1/(D-2) =0.
This algebraic equation reduces to a simple quadratic equation in
 either when the last term vanishes due to 
 (the case of a traceless form field EMT) or when its
degree  equals  or . For  we
have ,  and  so
that as only sensible model remains . It will be the
subject of subsection .

For  we find as physically sensible solution of Eq.
3.5 
3.6 
X=12 (9+8q -1) .
We use this solution as well as the extremum condition
3.4-11-3  to rewrite Eqs. 3.4-11-1  - 3.4-11-3 ,
3.4-11-5  - 3.4-11-7  in the simpler form
3.7 
U_0(X)&=&3 16 X^-1/3 (X-1) ,
 _eff (X)&=&13U_0(X)-h ,
R_1&=&4[13 U_0(X)+h] ,

J_11 =^2_ .U_eff _extr &=&23 [9h-U_0(X)] ,

J_22 =^2_ .U_eff _extr &=&1 14 X^-1/3 (2X+1)
,
 J_12 =^2_ .U_eff _extr &=&0 .Obviously, there is no mixing of the excitations of the
nonlinearity field  with gravexcitons  in this
case: , . Further, we
read off from ,  that stable internal spaces are
again only possible for 
 and from 3.6  and  that  is restricted to the
half-line . Additional information can be extracted by
combining the condition  with relations 3.7-2 ,
3.7-3 , what gives 3.8  16h>R_1>16U_0(X)/9>8_eff .
For the realistic case of a positive effective cosmological
constant we find according to 3.7-2 , 3.8  the conditions
3.9  _eff >0: h>R_1/16>U_0(X)/9>h/3>0, and,
hence, from 3.6 , 3.7-1  also the implication 
. We therefore
conclude that such configurations are only possible for internal
spaces with positive scalar curvature  and positive bulk
cosmological constant .

Let us briefly comment on some limiting cases.
 
[(L.2.1)] : In this case we recover the result of
 that stable configurations are only possible for
  [see the inequality chain
3.8 ].
[(L.2.2)] :
For this transition to the linear model with freezing of the
nonlinearity field at  and diverging excitation mass
, the stability sector 
 can be read off from 3.8  via substitution 
.
[(L.2.3)] :
The limit is connected with , , ,
 and we have to distinguish two special cases. For a
nonvanishing form field strength  according to
3.7-4 , 3.7-5  inequalities  hold so that
both excitation masses remain finite. For vanishing field strength
 we obtain ,
 ,  and the internal space 
undergoes a destabilization/decompactification with 
.







Two-dimensional internal spaces:
  

According to Eqs. 3.4-11-4 , 3.5 , the extremum condition
 for models with
two-dimensional internal space  and  can be reduced to
a quadratic equation and, hence, allows for an easy analytical
handling of the models. Introducing the notation
5.1 
z:=4h
Eq. 3.5  reads
5.2 
X^2-2(z-1)X-3(q+1)=0
and has solutions
5.3 
X_1,2 =z-1(z-1)^2+3(q+1) .
Furthermore, Eq. 3.5  can be used to simplify the elements of
the Hessian . Setting  and  everywhere in
3.4-1 , 3.4-11-5  - 3.4-11-7  and eliminating  with
the help of 5.2  we obtain(The curvature term in
 of Eq. 3.4-11-5  cancels because of  for
, .) 
5.4 
 J_11  && .
^2_  U_eff  _extr  = 1 6 X^-1/2 (5z+1-X) , 

J_22  && . ^2_  U_eff 
_extr  = 1 10  X^-1/2  ( X
-z+1) ,
 J_12  && .
^2_  U_eff  _extr  =-
1 25   X^-1/2 z as well as
5.5 
(J)=-1 60^2 X (X^2-6zX+8z^2-4z-1) .
 It is now easy to describe the part  of the parameter space  where the stability
 region  is located.
We start by substituting the solutions 5.3  into .
Taking into account that , we get from the condition
 for , :
5.6 
(z-1)^2+3(q+1) />0 .
Thus, the roots  and    correspond to  and
, respectively. Because of ,  this
leads to negative values for  so that this root is
 unphysical and stable configurations are restricted to  and 
. The limiting case  will be considered separately below.

Furthermore, we see from the structure of Eqs. 5.4-1  -
5.5  that the Sylvester criterion selects a region
 from the plane which can be interpreted
as the projection of the
 stability region  on this plane.
Explicitly we have
5.7 
J_11 >0 && X<5z+1 , 
 J_22 >0 && X>z-1 , 
 (J)>0 &&  . where the inequalities 5.7-3  are easily derived from 5.5 
by calculating the critical values  for which 

. The intersection  of the
sectors defined by the conditions 5.7-1  - 5.7-3  and 
,  is shown on Fig. .


aei-z-x-2.eps  
Projection  of the stability region
  on the plane
(shaded areas). The two lines  and  (given
in Eqs. 5.11 ) separate the stable regions with:
  
 ,
  
  and
  
. 

In order to obtain information about the values of 
 (and ) which allow for a stable internal
space  it proves convenient to map the region
  via quadratic equation 5.2  or its solution
 from the plane on an equivalent region
 of the plane. For this purpose it is
sufficient to transform the inequalities 5.7-1  - 5.7-3 
and ,  for  and  into an equivalent
inequality set for  and . Let us demonstrate the mapping,
e.g., for inequality 5.7-1 . Substituting
 into the equation for the
critical line  and solving for  we obtain as
image of this line  a corresponding critical curve
 on the plane. (The same curve can be
obtained by substitution of  into the quadratic equation
5.2 .) With the help of two test points
,
 above and below the critical
curve , e.g. , , it is then easily
seen that  maps into . Applying the same
technique to 5.7-2 , 5.7-3  we obtain 5.8  J_11 >0
&& q<z(5z+6) , 
 J_22 >0 && q>-1-13 (z-1)^2 , 
 (J)>0 &&
 . Additionally we find from 
5.9 
 
The resulting intersection region  of Eqs.
5.8-1  - 5.9  is depicted in Fig. .


aei-z-q-2.eps  
 Projection  of the stability
region   on the
plane (shaded areas). The two lines  and
 (given in Eqs. 5.11a ) separate the stable regions
with:   
 ,
  
  and
  
.  

Let us now turn to the scalar curvature
  and the  four-dimensional effective cosmological constant
 .
The structure of Eqs. 3.4-11-1 , 3.4-11-2  and
3.4-11-3  suggests to consider  and  as
functions of .  Eliminating  from  Eqs.
3.4-11-2 , 3.4-11-3  (with the help of 5.2 ) we obtain
5.10 
R_1&=&1 6 X^-1/2 (X+4z-1) ,

_eff &=&1 12 X^-1/2 (X-2z-1)
.The graphics of the functions
5.11 
R_1(z,X)=0&&X_(R_1=0) =1-4z
 _eff (z,X)=0&&X_(_eff =0) =1+2z
 are included in Fig.
. For completeness, we map them also on the
plane. Following the same scheme as above we obtain
5.11a 
R_1(z,q)=0&& q_(R_1=0) =2z(4z-3) , 0z<1/4

_eff =0&& q_(_eff =0) =2z and the correspondences
5.12 
 
 From Fig.  and Fig.  we see that the
nonlinear model with two-dimensional internal space  allows
for stable configurations only in the cases
5.13 
 
It contains no stable configurations with an accelerated expansion
of the Universe  for internal spaces of
negative or vanishing scalar curvature .

Finally, we comment on some limiting cases.
 
[(L.3.1)] , : According to Figs. ,  this limit corresponds to
a vanishing form field , and a stabilization is possible
in the case of . Furthermore,  for   we can
approximate  with
 and the masses of the normal excitation modes
of the coupled field system follow from 3.4-8 ,
5.4-1  - 5.4-3  as
5.14 m_1^2&=&1 6 (v-1)^-1/2 [2-v+92 z +O (z^2)] ,

m_2^2&=&1 10 (v-1)^-1/2 [v-2+v 2v z
+O (z^2)] .
In the special case  we completely reproduce our earlier
results on nonlinear stabilized models without
form fields : , .
[(L.3.2)] :
For this transition to a linear
model we have as in (L.1.1)   as well as a
freezing of the nonlinearity field at ,  .
Using the approximation
5.15 
X=X_1(z,q)=1+z+(3q-2z)/4-(3q-2z)^2/64+z^2/4+O (^3)
we obtain the excitation masses as
5.16 
m_ ^2m_1^2& =  &^-1 -2h 5 +O ()
,
 m_ ^2m_2^2&= &3h-_D+O ()>0
so that the freezing is clearly seen from the diverging mass of
the nonlinearity field.  Additionally, we find from 5.10-1 ,
5.10-2 
5.17 
R_1&=&_D+3h
- 6 [27 (h+_D)^2-8h^2]
+O (^2)

_eff &=&_D-h 2 +3 4 [(h+_D)^2-4_D^2]+O (^2),what in the special case of a vanishing effective cosmological
constant  reproduces the results of Ref.
 for a linear model with Freund-Rubin form field:
, .
[(L.3.3)] , : In this case we have
. A substitution of the approximation


into the Hessian shows that there is no special behavior
of the excitation masses connected with this limit.
[(L.3.4)] :
 From 5.4-1  it follows in this limit , so that
beside a decoupling of the excitations the gravexciton mass
vanishes  and the internal space
 destabilizes. This is in full agreement with
 where a stabilization for  requires
.
[(L.3.5)] : In the limit  one observes a
regular behavior similar to (L.3.3).
 For parameter points near the line
,   we find from Eq.
5.10-1  
 so that the Hessian yields excitation masses of the form

 with some regular coefficients
 and
 5.18 m^2_1,2 (R_1=0,z)=1 40 X_0^-1/2 [9-5X_0 4(3-5X_0)^2+5(X_0-1)^2 ]
 .
 The masses  have finite values except at the
limiting points  (or ) and
 (or ) where both or one of
the masses diverge. We see that, with exception of the limiting
point(According to 5.18 , the limit 
 gives , 
. On the other hand, 
 implies  and according to 5.3  also
. Thus, the results of (L.3.1) and (L.3.4) can be
used to reproduce the same behavior of the excitation masses via
5.14 .)  , there occurs no
destabilization of the internal space  for vanishing scalar
curvatures . Due to the smooth behavior of the excitation
masses under the transition  we can identify this limit
with a stable decompactification  of an internal
space  with fixed topology. Clearly, in our local approach a
stable decompactified space with  is
indistinguishable from a stabilized internal space which is
Ricci-flat from the very beginning.


















Conclusions and discussion  

In the present paper we investigated multidimensional
gravitational models with a non-Einsteinian form of the action. In
particular, we assumed that the action is an arbitrary smooth
function of the scalar curvature . Additionally, the
D-dimensional spacetime was endowed with solitonic form fields of
generalized block-orthogonal Freund-Rubin type. This bulk matter
ansatz leads to a naturally factorized geometry and a spontaneous
compactification can be associated with it. For the considered
models, we concentrated on the stabilization problem for the extra
dimensions. As technique we used a reduction of the nonlinear
gravitational model to a linear one with an additional
self-interacting scalar field (nonlinearity scalar field). The
factorized geometry as well as the generalized Freund-Rubin ansatz
for the solitonic form field allowed for a dimensional reduction
of the considered models and a transition to the Einstein frame.
As result, we obtained an effective four-dimensional model with
nonlinearity scalar field and additional minimally coupled scalar
fields which describe conformal excitations of the scale factors
of the internal space.

A detailed stability analysis was carried out for the three most
simplest configurations of a model with one internal factor space
 and a quadratic curvature term: 
, where  plays the role of a
dimensional bare (bulk) cosmological constant. These three
configurations are characterized respectively by: 1) a vanishing
four-dimensional effective cosmological constant ,
2) a traceless form-field EMT, or 3) a
dimensional internal factor space . For all three
configurations, a stabilization of the internal space is only
possible in the case of a non-negative nonlinearity parameter
 and a bulk cosmological constant
  restricted by the condition 
. The transition 
is connected with a decompactification 
of the internal space . At the same time,  it
leads to a flattening of the effective potential in the direction
of the scale factor excitations and, hence, to a destabilization of 
(for a similar limiting behavior see also Ref.).

 From the three configurations, the model with the two-dimensional
internal space shows the richest features. It allows for stable
configurations in the cases  and
 as well as for
Ricci-flat internal spaces  . Interestingly, the various
stable configurations belong to a connected region in the
parameter space  and one can smoothly pass from one type
of configuration to another one, including a transition to stable
Ricci-flat internal spaces which can be described as "stable
decompactifications": , . As pointed out
in the Introduction, such a rich picture became possible due to
the presence of the real-valued form fields which satisfy the NEC
and the WEC and which compete with the nonlinearity scalar field.
The latter satisfies the NEC only marginally and can violate the
WEC.

Interestingly, for  dimensional internal spaces there
exist  parameter configurations with 
that can provide positive values of the effective four-dimensional
cosmological constant  (see e.g. Eqs. 5.12 ,
5.13 ). Thus, an accelerated expansion of the Universe seems
possible in accordance with observational data. Let us assume that
the values of the bulk cosmological constant  and the
form field strength  are set at some characteristic scale
.  Then we find for the parameters
,   and,
hence, . The latter corresponds to 
 (see 5.3 ) and comparison with
5.11a  shows that such configurations should yield an almost
vanishing effective cosmological constant .
With the help of Eq. 5.10-1  we can estimate the scalar
curvature  of the internal space as
6.0 
R_1z  X^-1/2  1  z 1+2z   4M ^2
 1+8M ^2    .
On the other hand, its value is connected with the fundamental
  scales ,   by the relations 0.1 , 0.2 
and 2.5a :
6.1 
R_1r_1^-2 (M_*(4+d_1)  M_Pl(4)  )^4/d_1 M_*(4+d_1) ^2 .
As mentioned in the discussion after Eq. 1.28 , the value of
 can be used as a measure of the nonlinearity of the original
model: . We see that weakly
nonlinear configurations correspond to , whereas 
 leads to a strongly nonlinear regime. With the help of 6.0 
and 6.1  we express this dimensionless nonlinearity parameter
 in terms of the different scales contained in
 our model:
6.2 X1+8M ^2
16 (M M_*(4+d_1)  )^4
(M_Pl(4)   M_*(4+d_1)   )^8/d_1  .
 From 6.2  we see that
setting   we obtain
 for ADD-type TeVscale models
whereas  can only be achieved for standard KK models with
.
 Stably compactified internal spaces in ADD-type models can be obtained
within a weakly nonlinear regime  if
 the bulk cosmological constant
 and the form field strength  are related with the fundamental
scales as
6.3 
_D hM ^2, M
12 M_*(4+d_1) 
(M_*(4+d_1)   M_Pl(4)   )^2/d_1 .
For  TeV and  this implies 
eV. It is interesting to note that this
mass scale is of the same order as the lowest possible
supersymmetry breaking scale  in the
minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM)
 with  TeV.

Above we demonstrated that the assumption  can
result in a small effective cosmological constant .
Let us now estimate the relation between  and
 in more detail and compare it with the observable
value(In our normalization conventions holds 
and .)  of
. For simplicity, we
will restrict our consideration to a weak nonlinearity regime with
,  where the approximations
5.17-1  and 5.17-2  of (L.3.2) are valid.
  From 5.17-2  we see that to ensure  a
sufficiently small  the bulk cosmological constant
 and the field strength  of the solitonic form field
should be connected by
6.6 
h=(1+)_D .
The value of the small  we will estimate now.  With the help
of relations 5.17-1  and 6.3  we find
6.7 
10^-123 _Pl(4) _eff &&_D(1-6_D)/2

 _D &&  M ^2 R_1 and, hence,
6.8 
10^-123 (M_*(4+d_1)  M_Pl(4)  )^4/d_1+2 
so that
6.9 
10^-65 
for , TeV. According to 6.7  this
value of  is not sensitive to changes of the
nonlinearity parameter  in a weakly nonlinear curvature
regime. Thus, we arrive at the conclusion that the ADD scenario in
its simplest extended version can provide a simultaneous
stabilization of the extra dimensions together with an adjustment
of the effective cosmological constant to its observed value only
in the case of a strong fine tuning. Although the solitonic form
fields of our model are located in the compactified extra
dimensions, the tuning of their effective energy density   to
the bulk cosmological constant : 
 is of a similar type as the
four-form-tuning discussed in Weinberg's no-go theoremfor a resolution of the cosmological constant problem (CCP). A
shifting of the CCP to a parameter fine tuning is a rather general
feature of models with compactified additional dimensions and form
fields(For a similar mechanism in RSII-type models with
form fields see Ref..) . In a slightly reshaped form it
also appears in the recently proposed brane-world model with
two-dimensional "football"-shaped large extra dimensions
 (see also) where the adjustment of the
on-brane cosmological constant is shifted to an adjustment of the
parameters of the off-brane "football". A possible resolution of
the CCP for similar higher dimensional models with form fields
following from an M-theory setup was presented in Ref.
. Proposals for a resolution of the CCP within other
scenarios comprise various anthropic approaches
, shifting of the CCP to a singularity problem
, possible graviton compositeness, a
holographic approach as well as non-local
modifications of gravity. However, there is still
no satisfactory and comprehensive solution of the CCP. The problem
will probably remain challenging the scientific community until a
final understanding of quantum gravity will be achieved.
