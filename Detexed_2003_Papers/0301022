 Abstract 
 

We derive an explicit formula for the low energy limits of the
one-loop on-shell  - photon amplitudes, for arbitrary  and
all helicity assignments, in scalar and spinor QED.
The two-loop corrections to the same amplitudes are obtained
for up to the ten point case. 
All photon amplitudes with an odd number of
'+' helicities are shown to vanish in this limit 
to all loop orders.



Introduction: On-shell QED photon amplitudes 

In recent years substantial progress has been made in the
computation of on-shell one-loop amplitudes.  
This has been due to
the development of new techniques 
which provide alternatives
to the standard Feynman diagrammatic approach, as well as
to progress in the calculation of the basic integrals 
.
Much of this work has been concerned with massless amplitudes, 
which are computationally the most accessible ones. 
It led to a number of unexpectedly simple results for certain special
helicity configurations of photon or gluon amplitudes 
(see for a review).
A particularly striking result is Mahlon's observation that the
massless one-loop QED  - photon amplitudes vanish on-shell for 
all . 

For the corresponding amplitudes involving massive
loops little is known beyond the four-point case
. 
In the present paper, we will investigate the QED 
 photon amplitudes in the limit of low photon energies, i.e. 
with photon momenta such that all kinematic invariants 
 are small compared to 
(see for a discussion of this approximation for
the photon scattering case). As is well-known
(see, e.g.,), in this limit the photon amplitudes
are directly related to the QED effective Lagrangian 
 for a background
field with a constant field strength tensor . Namely,
to obtain the amplitude with photon momenta
 and polarisation vectors
, define for every leg the
field strength tensor 

F_i^  && k_i^ _i^  -  k_i^ _i^ 
and 

F_tot  && _i=1 ^N F_i

The corresponding amplitude is then obtained by inserting 
 into the effective Lagrangian, and extracting
the terms involving each  precisely once:

^(EH) 
[k_1,_1;;k_N,_N]
&=&
L (iF_tot )_F_1F_N 
At one loop, the QED effective Lagrangian for the constant field strength
case is just the
well-known Euler-Heisenberg
Lagrangian whose
weak field expansion is known in closed form. 
Nevertheless, it appears that () was previously applied
only to the textbook case of photon-photon scattering.

In G.V. Dunne and one of the authors had
considered the special case of constant self-dual  background
fields, and 
derived closed-form expressions for the corresponding
two-loop Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian and its scalar QED analogue.
Due to the well-known correspondence between self-dual fields
and helicity eigenstates 
this Lagrangian still contains the full information on the
low energy limit of the all '+' component of the  - photon
amplitudes in the helicity decomposition. The relation 
() could thus be used to derive simple closed-form
expressions for these amplitudes not only at one but also at
two loops, for arbitrary , in scalar and spinor QED.

In the present paper we extend the same approach to
the case of arbitrary helicity assignments. 
Applying ()
to the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian 
and its scalar QED analogue will allow us to
obtain closed-form
expressions for the low energy limits of the one-loop -photon 
amplitudes with arbitrary helicity assignments.
The standard spinor helicity technique 
will
turn out highly useful in working out the algebra of the
field strength tensors .
  
Although various integral representations have been derived
for the corresponding two-loop effective Lagrangians
, 
for the case of a general constant field none of them
is sufficiently explicit to obtain corresponding all -  formulas 
at the two - loop level. Nevertheless, we will use the formulas
given in 
to obtain the weak-field expansions of these
two - loop effective Lagrangians up to the order , which will
allow us to compute the corresponding photon amplitudes up to
the ten point case.  

One loop spinor QED 

Let us begin with spinor QED at the one-loop level.
We will use the standard integral representation
of the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian,

L _spin ^(1)  
&=&
-
18^2 
_0^ dTT 
^-m^2T 
e^2ab(eaT)(ebT) 
-e^23 (a^2-b^2)
-1T^2 


Here  denotes the propertime of the
loop fermion, and  are related to the two
invariants of the Maxwell field by
.
The charge  will often be set to unity in the following.
The subtraction of the terms of zeroeth and second order
in  corresponds to on-shell renormalization.
These terms are not relevant for our purposes and
will be omitted in the following. 
The invariants 
 can be related to the field strength tensor 
and its dual 
(We work in Minkowski space with 
 and .) 

,

a^2 &=&
(F_ F^ )^2
+(F_ F^ )^2 
+F_ F^  


b^2 &=&  
(F_ F^ )^2
+(F_ F^ )^2 
-F_ F^  


We wish to use this Lagrangian to obtain the low energy
limit of the 
on-shell  - photon amplitude for arbitrary
 and with an arbitrary 
helicity assignment. Due to Furry's theorem we can, of course,
assume that  is even. 
Since in the abelian case the ordering of the legs does not
matter we shall further assume that legs  carry
the helicity '+' and the remaining ones helicity '-'.
Also, by CP invariance flipping all helicities
is equivalent to changing all momenta from outgoing to
ingoing. It is therefore sufficient to consider the
case .
To construct suitable polarisation vectors we use the
standard spinor helicity formalism.
In this formalism, a polarisation vector with circular polarisation
'' for a photon with momentum  is written as
^ _  &=&
q^ _ k^ 2 q^ k^  
Here 

etc. are basic spinor products, and  is a reference momentum
(see for details and conventions).
Changes of the reference momentum amount to gauge transformations.
As usual we will use the notation

ij&& k_i^-k_j^+


ij&& k_i^+k_j^-


So, let us use () with some arbitrary choice of 
reference momenta  to define polarisation vectors
.
In the corresponding field strength tensor for leg 

F_i^  && k_i_i^  - _i^ k_i
the dependence on  already drops out, as is easily verified.
Using standard manipulations (see, e.g.,) the
following identities are found to hold

F^+_i,F^+_j ^  &=& -[ij]^2^  


F^-_i,F^-_j^  
&=& -ij^2^  

F^+_i,F^-_j &=& 0 

tr (F_i^+F_j^-) &=& 0 Moreover, as expected on general grounds
 
one finds the self duality properties

F^ _i &=&  iF^ _i
With the help of these relations it is easy to compute the
two Maxwell invariants for the case of :

F_tot  F^ _tot 
&=&
_+ + _-


F_tot  F^ _tot 
&=&
-i(_+ - _-)


where we have introduced

_+ && _1i < j N [ij]^2 

_- && _1i < j N ij^2 

Using () in () yields

a &=& _+  + _-  

b &=& -i(_+ -_- )  

The choice of sign for  does not matter since  and 
appear only squared in the Lagrangian (). Similarly,
there is no need to introduce a sign convention for 
. 

Using these results in () we get

L _spin ^(1) (iF_tot ) 
&=&
-
18^2 
_0^ dTT 
^-m^2T 
(_+ +_- )
(_+ -_- )
((_+ +_- )T)
((_+ -_- )T) 


To obtain the individual helicity amplitudes, we
need to expand this as a power series in 
. 
Using the Taylor series,

xx  &=&
_n=0 ^ (-1)^n2^2n B _2n (2n)! x^2n 
(the  are Bernoulli numbers) yields

L _spin ^(1) (iF_tot ) 
&=&
-m^48^2 
_N=4 ^ 
(2em^2 )^N
_K=0 Keven   ^N 
c_spin ^(1) (K2 ,N-K2 )
_+^K2 _-^N-K2 


where

c_spin ^(1) (K2 ,N-K2 )
&=&
(-1)^N2 (N-3)!
_k=0 ^K_l=0 ^N-K 
(-1)^N-K-l 
B _k+l B _N-k-l 
k!l!(K-k)!(N-K-l)! 


Here we have omitted the irrelevant terms of order
, . According to
(), the amplitude with  ''
and  '' helicities is obtained from the
corresponding term in the sum ()
by picking out the terms which involve each field strength
tensor  exactly once. It is immediately seen that
such terms exist only if  is an even number.
Thus all amplitudes with an odd number of '' helicities
do, in fact, vanish in the low energy limit.
For  even, let us define

_K^+ && (_+)^K2 
_all different 

&=&
(K 2  )!
2^K2  
[12]^2[34]^2[(K-1)K]^2 +  all  permutations 


_N-K ^- && (_-)^N-K2 
_all different 

&=&
(N-K 2  )!
2^N-K2  
(K+1)(K+2)^2(K+3)(K+4)^2
(N-1)N^2 +  all  perm. 


The final result for the amplitude can then be written as

_spin ^(1)(EH) 
[_1^+;;_K^+;_K+1 ^-;;_N^-]
&=&
-m^48^2 
(2em^2 )^N
c_spin ^(1) (K2 ,N-K2 )
_K^+_N-K ^-

(here and in the following we omit the momenta
 in the argument of amplitudes).


One-loop scalar QED 

The scalar QED case is completely analogous, and we will
write down only the main formulas. The analogue of the
Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian () for the
scalar QED case was
given by Schwinger
:

L _scal ^(1)  
&=&
116^2 
_0^ dTT 
^-m^2T 
e^2ab(eaT)(ebT) 
+e^26  (a^2-b^2) -1T^2 
]


Using the Taylor expansion

xx &=&
-_n=0 ^ 
(-1)^n(2^2n -2)B _2n 
(2n)! x^2n 
we can use the same procedure as in the spinor QED case.
Again the result vanishes for
odd , and for even  one obtains 
a formula analogous to ():

_scal ^(1)(EH) 
[_1^+;;_K^+;_K+1 ^-;;_N^-]
&=&
m^416^2 
(2em^2 )^N
c_scal ^(1) (K2 ,N-K2 )
_K^+_N-K ^-

where now

c_scal ^(1) (K2 ,N-K2 )
&=&
(-1)^N2 (N-3)!
_k=0 ^K_l=0 ^N-K 
(-1)^N-K-l 


&&
(1-2^1-k-l) )
(1-2^1-N+k+l )
B _k+l B _N-k-l 
k!l!(K-k)!(N-K-l)! 


Two-loop scalar and spinor QED 

The following integral representation was obtained
in for the two-loop generalization of the
Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian (): 

L _spin ^(2)  
&=&
16^3 
_0^ dT
_0^TdT'
K(T,T') - K_0(T)T' 
+K_0(T)(ln (m^2T)+-56 )


where

K(T,T') &=&
^-m^2T 
a^2b^2PP' 
[4m^2(SS'+PP')I_0+I]

&&
-1TT'(T+T') 
[
4m^2 +2T+T'  + a^2-b^23 
(2m^2(2T^2+2T'^2-TT')-5TT'T+T' )
]


K_0(T) &=& ^-m^2T 
(4m^2 -T )
(
ab(aT)(bT) -1T^2  -a^2-b^23 
) 

I_0 &=& 1B-A (BA )

I&=& q-pB-A I_0-qB -pA B-A 

p&=& 2a^2(b(T'-T))(aT)(aT') ,q= 2b^2(a(T'-T))(bT)(bT') 

P&=& sinh (aT)(bT),S= (aT)(bT)

A&=& a((aT) + (aT')),B= b((bT) + (bT'))

Here  is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. The charge  has been
set to unity.


In contrast to the one-loop formula ()
it is not known how to obtain from this
integral representation a closed-form expression
for the coefficients of the weak field expansion.
Therefore, at two loops we contend ourselves
with a calculation of this expansion to a certain order.
Using MATHEMATICA we have found it straightforward to
compute this expansion up to the order .
As in the one-loop case, from the
resulting polynomial in  we can directly read off
the helicity amplitudes for . To obtain a nonvanishing result,
again we have to assume that not only  but also 
are even. Its form is analogous to ():

_spin ^(2)(EH) 
[_1^+;_K^+;_K+1 ^-;;_N^-]
&=&
-m^48^2 
(2em^2 )^N
c_spin ^(2) (K2 ,N-K2 )
_K^+_N-K ^-

where the coefficients 
are given in the appendix.


For the scalar QED case, we use the similar representation
L _scal ^(2)  
&=&
-32^3 
_0^ dT
_0^TdT'
K(T,T') - K_0(T)T' 
+K_0(T)(ln (m^2T)+-76 )


where now
K(T,T') &=&
^-m^2(T+T') 
a^2b^2PP' 
[m^2I_0-I2 ]

&&
-1TT'(T+T') 
[
m^2-1T+T'  - a^2-b^26 
(m^2(T+T')^2-m^2TT'-11TT'(T+T')   )
]


K_0(T) &=& ^-m^2T 
(m^2 +T )
(
ab(aT)(bT) -1T^2  + a^2-b^26 
) 

I&=& q-pB-A 
I_0-qB -pA B-A 

p&=& 2a^2(coth (aT)coth (aT')-3),q = 2b^2(cot (bT)cot (bT')+3)

 are as in ().
Computation of the weak field expansion to the same order 
 yields

_scal ^(2)(EH) 
[_1^+;_K^+;_K+1 ^-;;_N^-]
&=&
m^416^2 
(2em^2 )^N
c_scal ^(2) (K2 ,N-K2 )
_K^+_N-K ^-

with coefficients also given in the appendix.

Conclusions 
To summarize, we have shown here that the use of the 
effective action, when combined with spinor helicity
techniques, provides a simple and elegant way
to obtain information on the low energy limit of the
QED  photon amplitudes. This has allowed us to 
derive an explicit
formula for the one-loop  point amplitudes, as well
as for the two-loop amplitudes up to the ten-point case.
In particular, it has turned out that all amplitudes
with an odd number of '+' helicities vanish in the low energy
limit. From the approach presented here it is clear that
this property follows directly from the fact that the constant field
effective action can be written as a function of the two
Maxwell invariants. We therefor conclude that this vanishing must
persist to all loop orders. Since these amplitudes are not forbidden
by any known symmetries, and indeed,
the one-loop four-point  amplitude is known to be non-vanishing
with full momentum,
this comes rather unexpected (for the special case of the amplitudes
with all helicities but one positive this vanishing 
had been noted
already in). 

Obviously, the self-duality relations 
fulfilled by field strength tensors with definite
helicities, eqs. () play an important part in these simplifications.
We expect that these relations, as well as the
variables , will also have a useful role
to play for the photon amplitudes at full momentum.
One indication for this is the appearance of factors
of traces of products of field strength tensors 
in the parameter integrals for the  - photon
amplitudes generated by the Bern-Kosower formalism
. 
Work in this direction is in progress.
