M(atrix) theory in PP-wave background possesses a
discrete set of classical  vacua, all of which
preserves 16 supersymmetry and interpretable as collection of
giant gravitons.  We find Euclidean instanton solutions that
interpolate between them, and analyze their properties. 
Supersymmetry prevents direct mixing between different vacua 
but still allows effect of instanton to show up in higher order 
effective interactions, such as analog of  interaction of 
flat space M(atrix) theory. An explicit construction of zero modes
is performed, and Goldstone zero modes, bosonic and fermionic,
are identified. We further generalize this to  massive M(atrix) 
theory that includes fundamental hypermultiplets, corresponding 
to insertion of longitudinal fivebranes in the background. After 
a brief comparison to their counterpart in , we 
close with a summary.

Introduction 

Maximally supersymmetric plane waves background in eleven
dimensions is obtained from either  or 
 by taking the Penrose limit. String theory
or M-theory in the plane waves background admits rich
tractable structures which are useful to understand AdS/CFT
duality and physics in the presence of Ramond-Ramond flux:
Lightcone Green-Schwarz action of type IIB string theory is free
and exactly quantizable. M-theory in eleven
dimension has a M(atrix) theory formulation with a
mass parameter  which can be used as an expansion
parameter in appropriate combination with usual Yang-Mills
coupling. 
 

For M(atrix) theory in the plane waves background,
first written down by Berenstein, Maldacena, and Nastase (BMN),
the vacua are characterized by discrete set of fuzzy spheres
which preserve all 16 dynamical supersymmetries. They are
nothing but D0-branes expanded by Myers' dielectric term
. Tracing back to  space, 
these fuzzy spheres originate from giant gravitons rotating
with the velocity of light in the  space or in the sphere 
.  
One purpose of this note is to examine physics of giant gravitons 
in this  more tractable quantum theory.

Given such  degenerate set of vacua, an obvious thing
to ask is whether there are instantons that interpolate between 
different classical vacua. It turns out that search for instantons
is greatly simplified thanks to BPS-like properties of the  
latter. That is, instantons interpolating between fully supersymmetric 
vacua of this theory preserves half of  dynamical
supersymmetry.  Those instantons that interpolate between any 
nontrivial vacuum  and the perturbative
vacuum are particularly simple, it turns out, and an explicit 
counting of zero modes, bosonic and fermionic, is carried out.
As supersymmetry may already suggests, these instantons have too
many fermionic Goldstone zero modes to mix vacua, and will 
contribute to higher order interaction terms only.

This note is organized as follows. After a brief review of  
the BMN M(atrix) theory in section 2, we take analytic continuation  
into the Euclidean time in section 3.  Here we have to deal with subtlety 
associated with Majorana condition on fermions, utilizing "double 
fermion technique".  BPS-like equation 
follows then, either by writing Euclidean action in a complete square form
or by writing down supersymmetry condition. We solve for all instantons
that interpolate between the perturbative vacuum and arbitrary 
collections of giant gravitons.

In section 4, we construct bosonic and fermionic zero modes around
these instantons explicitly. Apart from 8 fermionic zero modes
and a single bosonic zero mode, each arising from spontaneously
broken symmetry, we find a large number of extra zero modes for
most of these instantons. This leads us to believe that there are
more diverse form of instantons, which we confirm in part in section 5.  

Section 6 repeats the computation for certain mass-deformed 
 SYQM. 
The latter have been discovered and identified  as M(atrix) 
theory in the presence of longitudinal fivebranes . 
Among
the vacua of this latter theory are giant gravitons trapped by
the longitudinal fivebranes. We again isolate and study supersymmetric
instantons that  interpolate from a generic vacuum to the perturbative 
one. After a review of giant gravitons and instantons in , 
the Penrose limit thereof in section 7, we close with summary.

BMN Matrix Theory and Classical Vacua 

We start with a summary of the mass deformed BMN M(atrix) theory 
. Here we review some basic
properties of the theory, in part to set up the notation, and
recall its classical vacuum structure.



Lagrangian and Supersymmetry 



Introducing  real and symmetric
 Dirac matrices,
_I (I=1,2...9)
the Lagrangian of the mass-deformed M(atrix) theory of BMN is
L&=&  12( _I (D_0X_I)^2 +
1 2 _IJ [X_I,X_J]^2 + i^T D_0-^T _I[X_I, ] )&+&1 2 ( -( 3 )^2
_a=5,6,7  (X_a)^2 -( 6 )^2
_s=1,2,3,4,8.9 (X_s)^2 ) 

&+&1 2 ( 2i 3 
_abc  X_a X_b X_c -i 4  ^T_567   ),
Here the fermion  is Majorana.(The
Majorana condition in 9+1 dimensions is achieved by imposing a
Majorana condition,
^T
for some charge conjugation matrix . For 16-component fermion here, 
we may introduce  which is a  block off  
such that
B(^I)^*B^-1 =^I, BB^*=1
In the present case, we  may choose  so that 's are real and
symmetric.) 
In addition, both  and  are valued in  
hermitian matrices for an integer . Dimensionful
quantity  introduces a mass-gap to the system and make the
spectrum of the theory completely discrete. For the most part, we will
be concerned with ground state sector of this theory.

This Lagrangian was shown to be invariant under the following
16 (dynamical) supersymmetry transformation

A_0 &=& i^T ,   

X_I&=& i^T _I , 

&=& ( D_0 X_I _I  -i 2 
[X_I,X_J]_IJ  )

&+&( 3 _a=5,6,7  X_a_a
_567  - 6 _s=1,2,3,4,8,9  X_s_s
_567 
) .

provided that we force the following explicit time-dependence of the
transformation parameter ,

(t) = e^- 12 _567 t  _0 , 
which makes the superalgebra quite unconventional. In particular,
supercharges do not commute with the Hamiltonian, but raise
or lower energy by  unit. The notion of "supermultiplet"
no longer implies degeneracy in this deformed superalgebra.


Classical Vacua are Collections of Giant Gravitons 

The potential of the mass-deformed matrix theory of BMN lifts 
flat directions altogether, and instead leave behind a set of
discrete vacua. One way to see this is to realize that  
the potential can be written in a complete square form. 
Setting  for  as a matter of convenience, 
the potential reduces to 
V(-1 4 _a,b=5,6,7 [X^a, X^b]^2 +
12 ( 3 )^2 _a=5,6,7  (X^a)^2
-i 3  _abc  X^a X^b X^c ), 
which can be made into a complete square, 

-14 ( [X^b,X^c] +i 3  _bca X^a)^2.

Thus zero of the potential is given by 's satisfying a
set of commutation relationship 
[X^a,X^b]=-i 3 ^abc X^c ,

and classical vacua
are given by static configurations of the form 
X^a=- 3 J^a , 

with any  dimensional
representation  of .

Nothing here requires 's to form an irreducible representation,
so we should look for general  dimensional representation. We
may do this by filling out three  matrices with various
irreducible representations of . Different ordering
among such irreducible blocks are all gauge equivalent, and
therefore classification of vacua comes down to classifying
inequivalent partitions of the integer .

These classical vacua are reminiscent of bound states of 
original M(atrix) theory. In the latter, the bound 
states are supposed to exist for any number of D0's, which
means that Hilbert space contain sectors of  particles bound
together for any partition of  (). 
Given the  BMN M(atrix) theory, there is precisely one such 
distinct state for each partition , corresponding 
to a direct sum of  dimensional irreducible representations of
. These classical states (and their quantum counterparts) are
closest thing we have to usual Kaluza-Klein modes of supergraviton, 
or equivalently BPS bound states of D-particles. In fact, one may
think each of these  blocks as the bound state
 D-particles which are blown-up into a spherical membrane due
to Myers' dielectric effect . In the 
mass deformed version here, flat directions are lost
and everything is confined near the origin, yet it is tantalizing
that hint of these D0 bound states still survives in the form of
discrete set of classical vacua.

Euclidean  Instantons 

Euclidean Action and Supersymmetry 

We wish to look for interpolating solution between different vacua,
so a natural thing to do is to Euclideanize the theory. The upshot 
is that we can do this effectively by mapping

t-i

which is actually is a result of more careful operation that maintains 
10-dimensional origin for fermions. Rest of this subsection will 
address how to do this more carefully.

Analytic continuation to the Euclidean signature
is often hazardous when real fermions are present. The problem 
with real fermions in field theory is that representation theory 
under  Clifford algebra is different from that under 
.
Since fermions of this quantum mechanics came from 
spinors, this sort of problem again shows up when we try to
perform a Euclidean continuation of this quantum mechanics. 
On the other hand, this also tells us that the
trick we can use is already available in field theory language,
where we abandon hermiticity of Lagrangian, 
"double" fermion content by regarding the
conjugated fermions as independent, and then impose
certain "Majorana-like" constraints on the pair 
.

Let us start by rewriting the Minkowski action in  spinor
notation.
 L_M&=& 12( _I (D_0X_I)^2 +
1 2 _IJ [X_I,X_J]^2 - i^0 D_0-_I[X_I, ] )&+&1 2 (
-( 3 )^2 _a=5,6,7  (X_a)^2
-( 6 )^2
_s=1,2,3,4,8.9 (X_s)^2 ) 

&+&1 2 ( 2i 3 
_abc  X_a X_b X_c -i 4  _567   ),
where  is Majorana-Weyl spinor and 10 dimensional  matrices
are given
&& ^0=1 i_2 ,

&& _I = _I_1  (I=1,2...9),

&& ^11  = 1_3, where  are usual  hermitian  Dirac matrices.

Weyl spinor  is subject to the chirality condition
 _11  = - .
which effectively reduces  to be 16-component, 
justifying the fact that the same notation  is used for 
16-component spinor of previous section and for the current 
32-component spinor with upper half identically zero. 
In particular this means that 
matrices 's are effectively  matrices of the
following form, 
&&^0+1 , &&_I_I ,

when acting on 
directly. 
Finally, the Majorana condition on  is 
 = C ^T,
where the charge conjugation matrix C is chosen to be
 C = 1 i _2,
which satisfies
 C _I = - ^T C_I, C^T = -C.
This gives the Minkowski action of the previous section.

We may Euclideanize the action and the supersymmetry by taking
 t = -i (D_0 = i D_),
 ^0 = -i _10 ,
where
 _10  = 1 _2.
Imposing Euclidean Weyl condition on the fermions, we
have effective reduction of Dirac matrices to .
&&_10 -i  

&&_I_I 

&&_10  _I i _I,
when acting on  directly.
Furthermore, we use "fermions doubling" trick, introducing 
instead of .
L_E&=&  12( _I (D_X_I)^2-
1 2 _IJ [X_I,X_J]^2 + D_ 
+_I[X_I, ] )&+&1 2 ( +( 3 )^2
_a=5,6,7  (X_a)^2 +( 6 )^2
_s=1,2,3,4,8.9 (X_s)^2 ) 

&+&1 2 (- 2i 3 
_abc  X_a X_b X_c +i 4  _567   ).
Without Majorana condition, the path integral measure would be
[d][d].
However, we must impose a "Majorana-like" condition on the pair
  = ^T C,
where  is the same charge conjugation matrix in Minkowski
signature. The measure is effectively,
[d].
This is analogous to contour integral over complex bosonic 
coordinates.(
Note also that we have abandoned hermiticity of the Lagrangian in doing 
this. This is not something new in fact. The same happens even for bosons 
when we start with canonical variables. For fermions, in a sense, we
are always working with canonical variables.) 

Supersymmetry transformations remain intact once Wick rotation is
performed. Transformation of bosons
are
 A_10  &=&  1 2  (- ) ,   

X_I&=&  i 2  (_I - _I
  ) ,
where  is related to  via
 = ^T C - ^T.
Transformation of fermions are such that,
&=& (i D_X_I _I
-i 2 
[X_I,X_J] _IJ  )

&+&( 3 _a=5,6,7  X_a _a _567 
- 6 _s=1,2,3,4,8,9  X_s _s  _567 
) , from which transformation of 
may also be inferred. Time-dependence of supersymmetry parameter
must be analytically continued as well,   () = e^i 12  _567 
    _0.
 BPS Bound and Unbroken Supersymmetry 

With a discrete set of vacua, all degenerate with each other, it is
natural to expect an instanton that interpolate between
such vacua. Large number of supersymmetry tends to prohibit
a direct mixing of classical vacua even if an instanton is present,
but it does not mean that instantons do not enter physical processes. 
We will come back to relevancy of instanton in a later section.
These issues will be addressed in section 4 in some detail, but
let us gather some elementary facts about Euclidean equation of
motion.

Gathering bosonic part of Euclidean action that involves the three
bosonic quantity 's, 

S_E=12d_a  (D_X_a)^2 + (  3 
X^a-i^abc X^bX^c)^2 +, 

we may
complete the square one more time, 

S_E&=&12d_a(D_X_a+
  3  X^a-i^abc X^bX^c)^2&&d_a((D_X_a)( 3  X^a-
i^abc X^bX^c))&+&.
The ellipsis denotes the remainder of the action, which are composed of
either a nonnegative part from the rest of 's or fermion bilinears,
none of which would be involved in the interpolating solution.

Setting the other fields to vanish, we find a topological lower
bound of the action from the second line, 

S_E&&dd d _a(( 6 
X^aX^a- i1 3 ^abc X^aX^bX^c))&&=
( 6  X^aX^a-
i1 3 ^abc X^aX^bX^c))^_- .

For configurations interpolating between two distinct vacua, we require

X^a()&=&- 3 J^a_+  ,X^a(-)&=&- 3 J^a_-  , 

With this, the lower bound of the Euclidean action collapses to
a trace over the quadratic Casimir invariant, 

S_E&& 1 6 ( 3 )^3 (J^a_+ J^a_+ -J^a_- J^a_- ) .

Thus, to find an
instanton solution between a pair of different vacua, it suffices
to solve the first order equations, 

D_X^a=
 3  X^a-i^abc X^bX^c  

under the
boundary condition (). The sign is chosen so that
the lower bound for the Euclidean action is nonnegative. It is not
difficult to check that any solution to this equation also solves full
equation of motion.


Any Euclidean solution that solves eq. () enjoys a
special property that it is preserved by half of 16 dynamical
supersymmetries. Wick rotating the SUSY transformation and
isolating transformation property of the fermions, we find
the following terms  

= (
iD_X_a _a  -i 2  [X_a,X_b]_ab  +
 3 _a=5,6,7  X_a_a _567  )


on the instanton background. On the other hand, we have
the identity, 

_ab =_c_567 ^abc ,

so that 

= i( D_X_a _a -
( 3  X_a-i^abc X^bX^c )_a
(i_567 ) ) =0 ,

provided that
i_567 _0=_0 ,

where the sign choice should be correlated with that of ().
With each choice of sign, then, these are the 8 preserved
supersymmetries promised. For this reason, we  refer to ()
as the BPS equation.

Instanton Solutions 

An infinite class of instantons can be found with a simplifying
condition, . This gives interpolating configuration
from an arbitrary vacuum at past infinite to the trivial 
perturbative one at
future infinity. The solution is fairly elegant. We use the
ansatz, 

X^a=- 3 f()J_-^a ,

with the static
gauge , and look for a solution with  and
. Equations with  sign 
reduces to a single ordinary differential equation, 
 
d d f=- 3 (f-f^2),
and the unique solution satisfying the boundary condition is, 
f()=1 1+((

where we kept a
collective coordinate  explicitly to parameterize where the
instanton is centered along the Euclidean time.

The value of the Euclidean action of this interpolating instanton
is 
S_E=1 6 ( 3 )^3J^a_-J^a_- .

Writing  as sum of irreducible 
representations with , value of the Euclidean
action is 

S_E=1 6 ( 3 )^3_p
n_p(n_p-1)^2 4  .

Such an instanton will contribute to some
physical processes but is suppressed by exponentially small factor
e^-S_E  . 
Finally, one should remember  to recover 
the actual dimensionless  exponent is .


Zero Modes 

Bosonic Zero Modes 

One particular collective coordinate is already manifest in the solution
above, which the Goldstone mode coming from time translation symmetry.
For any finite action solution to the BPS equation , the translational
zero mode,
D_X^a ,
is a normalizable zero mode.
A natural followup question is whether instanton solutions have more
bosonic zero modes and whether it is possible to break up an instanton
to two or more intermediate ones.
For this let us perturb the BPS equation. We may assume static gauge again,
, without loss of generality. Denoting by  the perturbed
part of , we have
d d  V^a=
 3  V^a-i^abc [X^b,V^c] and the problem reduces to classifying normalizable solutions to this.

The instanton solutions of previous subsection admit relatively
simple solutions to this zero mode counting problem. With the right choice
of sign, the equation is 

- d d  V^a=  3 
(V^a+f()i^abc [J^b_-,V^c])  .

In the far
future, , and the simple exponential behavior due
to the  piece is
consistent with the normalizability requirement on zero modes. 
The main issue is then what
happens at past infinity where . 

Two technical points are helpful here. First, one may regard
 as the generators  of . Second,
the commutator action with  in a representation  of 
actually form a representation . Thus
the matrix operator that must be diagonalized may be thought of as a triple
tensor product
K_b=5,6,7 T^b(J^b_-1 + 1J_-^b) .
Let us simplify further and consider the case of  in
the maximal (i.e., spin ) irreducible representation.
Square of the  dimensional irreducible representation 
is decomposed as 
[(N-1)/2][(N-1)/2]=[0][1][N-2][N-1] ,

which gives integer spins only. Tensoring each block 
with  with the adjoint representation [1] of
, we find 

[1][j]=[j-1][j][j+1] .

Eigenvalues of the operator 
for the three blocks on the right hand side are , ,
, respectively. Of these three, only the first can and does
produce normalizable zero mode,  number of them, for 
.

Thus, for an instanton that interpolates between a single maximal
giant graviton in the irreducible  form and the trivial 
vacuum, the bosonic zero modes within the same  block 
may be summarized as 
in the following table,
 
 
All of these zero modes decay as  at future infinity.
There are total  number normalizable bosonic zero modes.

Generally speaking,  one might need to take into account of nonnormalizable 
zero modes in case of Euclidean instantons. For solitons, the normalizability 
requirement arises from consideration of low energy effective action
of collective coordinates, since  norm of zero modes appear in
the effective kinetic term of the former. For instantons, the only 
requirement is that we maintain the same finite Euclidean action. This
by itself does not restrict the zero mode to be normalizable. 

In particular, there are  number of zero modes from the above 
(corresponding to ) that asymptote to constants at past infinity.
Under such a deformation, the instanton solution remain of the same 
finite action. These zero modes will deform  by constant
amount, but since small change that respect the vacuum condition
cannot alter the representation of , this deformation cannot 
change the action. Combined with the above normalizable zero modes,
we have total  number of possible deformations of a maximal
instanton that preserve the Euclidean action. On the other hand, 
none of the  nonnormalziable zero modes are physical. They
correspond to rotation of the instanton by global  unitary 
transformations. That is, these  modes are generated by
X^a()gX^a() g^.
In the temporal gauge, , we adopted, this is a pure gauge 
transformation when  is uniform. As a metter of definition 
of the theory, such a gauge 
parameter should not be included in the path integral. With more
general instantons with both  nontrivial, there could be 
relevant nonnormalizable zero modes that rotate one of two 
while leaving the other invariant.


Fermionic Zero Modes 

Large number of bosonic zero modes hint at similarly large number of
fermionic zero modes. Here, we will
perform an explicit construction of fermionic zero modes in much the same
way as in bosonic case above.
The fact that there are 8 broken supersymmetry implies existence
of fermionic zero modes arising as Goldstone fermionic modes.
These should be of the form 

_0 = i( D_X_a _a
( 3  X_a-i^abc X^bX^c )_a
) (D_X_a _a) ,

with wrong chirality fermions ; 
i_567 _0'=_0' 

Below we will also
recover these zero modes from general fluctuation analysis.
Because these arise as Goldstone modes, the associated Grassmann
coordinate are special among fermionic ones. Specifically,
they cannot have an "interaction vertex" in the effective action
of the instanton. 

The equation of motion for fermions in the instanton background is
D_+ 4  (i_567 )+ _a[X^a, ] 
=0.
Let us again specialize to those instantons which interpolate from
giant graviton with representation  to the trivial vacuum.
Normalizability at  requires  to be of positive
chirality under .
Normalizability at  depends on the last piece, which
on the instanton becomes 
- 3 f()^a[J_-^a,]  ,

so the problem
reduces to an eigenvalue problem under the operator 

K-^a(J_-^a1+1J_-^a) .

A zero
mode is normalizable if and only if the eigenvalue of this
operator is negative and .

Because only 3 out of 9 possible 's are involved, this
can also be solved using  algebra. Let us write the three 
gamma matrices
in a complex form
^a=^a,
where  is some chirality operator such that .
We will use the fact that , 
meaning that the eigenvalue of  is negative of that of
. Since normalizable zero modes must have positive
chirality under the latter, we have in effect,
K^a(J_-^a1+1J_-^a) ,
where we should remember the extra degeneracy coming from extra
spinor indices acted on by . After taking into account that 
, this degeneracy gives a factor of 4 when counting real
fermionic collective coordinates.

As in bosonic case, we consider the maximal irreducible instanton of size
 for  side initially. Square of the -diemsnional 
representations is 
[(N-1)/2][(N-1)/2]=[0][1][N-2][N-1]

Tensoring each block  with  with a
spin half representation [1/2] of , we find 
[1/2][j]=[j-1/2][j+1/2] 

eigenvalues of the
operator  for the three blocks on the right hand side are
 and , respectively. Of these two, only the first can
and does produce normalizable zero modes,  number of them, for
.
Thus, for an instanton that interpolates between a single giant graviton
in an irreducible  block and the trivial vacuum, the fermionic
zero modes may be summarized as in the following table,
 
 
All of these zero modes decay as  at future infinity.
Thus, given an irreducible -dimensional , The total number of 
real fermionic collective coordinates from these zero modes within the
same  block is .(
An unusual fact is that this number of fermionic zero modes match
up with the bosonic side, only if we inlcude all  nonnormalizable
zero modes in the latter. The latter gives 
, so one real bosonic mode correponds to one complex fermionic
mode. The reason behind this must be that 
supersymmetry parameter itself has a exponential dependence on 
, although it is not clear to us whether there is a precise
one-to-one matching between the two sets.) 


Of these the first 8 modes are associated with 8 broken supersymmetry.
The Goldstone modes of the latter  are proportional to
iD_X^a^a e^(/12) _0'
with . Comparing the asymptotic
form of this to the first 8 zero modes, we can see easily that they are
of identical form.

A Brief Comment on Stability of Vacua 

These 8 fermionic zero modes associated with the broken
supersymmetry are quite prohibitive in that instantons 
amplitudes get further suppression due to them.
Generally speaking instanton will
contribute to an operator  via a path integral, 
[dX][d]O e^-S  .

Essential part of such a
computation comes from integration over bosonic and fermionic
collective coordinates, call them  and , whereby
the path integral includes a piece 

_i dz^i_l
d^l O e^-S_E-S(z^i,^l)   

Integral
over Grassmann numbers  vanishes unless the integrand
produces matching fermions in one-to-on fashion.

For most fermionic zero modes, this is easy to arrange regardless
of , since the higher order correction to Euclidean
action, , will generally have a potential
term involving four (or more) 's. This does not contradict
the statement that  are zero modes, since the latter
simply implies absence of quadratic terms in case of fermions.
Such quartic potential term for fermionic collective coordinates
has been derived and used extensively in the context of Yang-Mills
theory.(Direct derivation of such higher order terms with
fermionic collective coordinate is 
particularly well-documented for the case of low energy dynamics
of monopoles in 4 dimensions. See Ref.  for detailed
description of how such terms arise.) 

Exception to this are Goldstone zero modes, bosonic or fermionic,
representing spontaneously broken global symmetries. Nonvanishing 
amplitude is possible only if one starts with  with enough 
fermions in it to cancel Goldstone fermionic coordinates. It
shows that there is no
mixing among classical vacua by these instantons, and that each
classical vacuum of giant gravitons must remain robust against quantum
tunneling. Effect of an instanton will show up only at higher order
operators. 

This, together with stability 
argument of Ref. , implies
that the classical vacua of giant
gravitons are in fact exact quantum mechanical vacua.
One could argue that being protected states 
is by itself enough to guarantee that classical supersymmetric
vacua carry over to quantum mechanics, yet, this sort of 
argument is known to fail in general supersymmetric theories.
Such stability argument applies within full quantum theory which
is in principle distinct from classical theory no matter how
close one gets near the latter. 
There are known cases where, despite classical 
BPS state, no quantum counterpart exist no matter how close to
classical limit one takes. The present theory seems to
escape such a possibility, likely due to relatively
large number of supersymmetries.


General Moduli Spaces 

So far, we studied a rather restricted class of
instantons (with ), and counted zero modes of even more 
special case of them, namely those with  in the irreducible
-dimensional representation filling out the entire .
We found  normalizable bosonic zero modes, 
nonnormalizable one which are unphysical due to gauge symmetry,
and  (real) fermion zero modes. As with any quantum theory,
one must understand entire species and moduli spaces of instantons
to make proper usage of it in path integral, so it is of prime
importance to catalog general instantons and their moduli spaces.

For instance, we should ask how the counting changes if we
instead consider  irreducible instanton embedded in
 theories. Bosonic zero mode arising from the same 
 block should follow from the above zero mode counting,
so we have  physical modes and  unphysical gauge
modes. Repeating the anaylsis of the previous section for "off-diagonal"
part of matrices 's, we find additional modes. Of these,
 are normalizable and have to be physical. In addition, 
 modes that approach constant at  also exist
but these are all accounted by global gauge rotation that takes
the  solution out into entire . We could
repeat this exercise for more general case with more than one
irreducible blocks embedded inside ;
it is again matter of studying eigenmodes of the algebraic 
operator , which become effectively
K_ij _b=5,6,7 T^b(J^b_i1 + 1J^b_j) ,
on different blocks in  when 's are independent 
irreducible representations of  inside .

For classification of instantons and their moduli space, it would
be desirable to approach the problem with more global viewpoint.
It turns out that  this issue was studied
in depth previously. An essentially same system of equations was
considered before in a different setting of  
Yang-Miils theory. It just so happens that the
vacuum condition and BPS equation for domain walls in 
theories are identical
to our vacuum condition and BPS equation for instantons. They
further mapped this system of equations into a mathematical
problem of an infinite dimensional hyperKahler quotient procedure
and constructed the solution space of the domain walls.

Among the information one could extract from their general approach 
would  be which domain wall (instanton) may split into which combination of 
domain walls (instantons). On the other hand, counting of deformation
was such that some pure gauge mode are counted along with physical 
ones.(Notably, this is the case when . ) 
Indeed numbers in Ref.  match precisely with ours whenever the
comparison is possible, once we include the global gauge modes in the
counting. The constructive approach we took is more detailed in that it
gives a simple distinction between the two classes of deformations.
Thus, when carefully combined, the two approaches should generate
essentially all information of the physical moduli space of instantons,
which would be vital if we were computing instanton effect via the
Eulidean path integral. In this note, we will not attempt this
general anaysis.



Vacua and Instantons in the Presence of Fivebranes 

A mass-deformation of  Matrix model including
hypermultiplets was derived in. It was constructed to
describe longitudinal fivebranes in the pp-wave background.
It was also found that there exist many continuous family of
classical vacuum solutions which preserve full dynamical
symmetries. Here, we will investigate whether
there are instanton solutions interpolating between these vacua.

To set up the notation, let us briefly recall what new fields are
involved in this  quantum mechanics. When we have 
longitudinal fivebranes probed by  M(atrix) theory, the only
modification to the  quantum mechanics is introduction of
 hypermultiplets in the fundamental representations. This
necessarily breaks SUSY down to  from ,
and thus split the adjoint Yang-Mills fields also into two 
 multiplets. In the BMN deformed M(atrix) theory considered
above, 9 adjoint scalars are already split into 3+6. We labeled
the first 3 as . In this notation,  fall
under the adjoint hypermultiplet. We further combine these 4
scalars in a complex form, 

y_2=X^6-iX^7,y_1=X^8-iX^9.
 
 Whenever we introduce an longitudinal fivebrane
sitting at the center, we should add a fundamental hypermultiplet 
with two complex scalars, 

q_2^(f) ,q_1^(f) .

Our convention is such that 's are
anti-fundamental representations while their conjugates, 
and , are in the fundamental representation.

We should note here that Ref. found two distinct
class of vacuum solutions invariant under all supersymmetries. One
set involving  give obvious generalization of the
Giant graviton in the bulk, while the other involves 
. In the following we found instanton solutions associated
with the former only. There appears to be no supersymmetric instanton
solution associated with the latter.




Abelian Case 

For simplicity, we first consider the instanton solution interpolating
between an Abelian giant graviton at past infinity and trivial
vacuum at future infinity.
Turning off irrelevant fields, we write down the Euclidean action
in a complete square form,
 S_E &=& 1 2  d Tr   (D_X_5 +
    (12  _f q_2^(f)  q_2^(f) 
        + 3  X_5 ) )^2  . 

    & & . + _f
       (D_q_2^(f)  +
        (X_5 + 3 ) q_2^(f)  )
       (D_q_2^(f)  +  q_2^(f)  (X_5
        + 3 )  )  

     & & 1 2  d Tr 
       (2 D_X_5 )
      (12  _f q_2^(f)  q_2^(f) 
      +  + 3  X_5 )  . 

     & & . +_(f)  D_q_2^(f) 
      (X_5 + 3  )
     q_2^(f)  + _f (X_5 + 3  )  q_2^(f) 
     D_q_2^(f)   

  && 12  d d d  Tr 
     (3  X_5^2 + 3 _f q_2^(f)  q_2^(f) 
       + X_5_f q_2^(f)  q_2^(f)  ) 

   &=& 1 2  Tr  ( 3  X_5^2
      + 3 _f q_2^(f)  q_2^(f) 
       + X_5_f q_2^(f)  q_2^(f) 
    ) _- ^+ .
Lower bound is saturated if the first order equations are satisfied,
 D_X_5 &=& 12  _f q_2^(f)  q_2^(f) 
             + 3  X_5 ,

 D_q_2^(f)  &=& X_5  q_2^(f) 
  + 3  q_2^(f) .
Dropping time dependence, we recover a Giant graviton of the form
 X_5 = -3 ,  q_2^(f) = 2  3  z^f,
where  is any complex -vector of unit length. Vacuum moduli space
is .


The ansatz for the instanton solution
interpolating between an Abelian giant graviton at past infinity
and perturbative vacuum at future infinity is
 X_5 () = - 3  f(),   q_2^(f)  () = 2  3  z^f g(),
with  and .
Inserting it into the first order equations with  sign,
we get
 f  = - 3  (f - g^2 ) , g  = - 3  (g - fg ).
A unique solution to this with the right asymptotic behavior is 
()
 f=g=1 1+ ((,
whose form is identical to the above  case.
The action is 
 S_E= 1 2 
 (3 )^3.
This solution has a single bosonic zero mode which corresponds
to a Goldstone mode.

General Case 

We now repeat the exercise for non-Abelian case and consider instanton
solutions interpolating between a nonabelian giant graviton at past
infinity and trivial vacuum at future infinity. Turning on adjoint
scalars ,  and fundamental scalars 
only, we have the following inequality of Euclidean action,
 S_E
  1 2  Tr  ( 3  X_5^2
      + 3 _f q_2^(f)  q_2^(f) 
       + 3  y_2 y_2
       + X_5_f q_2^(f)  q_2^(f)   + X_5 [y_2, y_2 ]
    ) _- ^+ .
The bound is saturated if and only if
 D_X_5 &=& 12  _f q_2^(f)  q_2^(f) 
             + 3  X_5 + 1 2  [y_2, y_2 ]  ,

 D_q_2^(f)  &=& X_5  q_2^(f) 
  + 3  q_2^(f)   , 

   D_y_2 &=& [ X_5 , y_2 ] + 3 
  y_2.
For the instanton solution interpolating between
an nonabelian giant graviton occupying an  block of
adjoint scalars at past infinity and perturbative vacuum
at future infinity,  we use an ansatz of the form,
 - (X_5)_AB () &=& 3  (m+1-A) f() _AB , 

 (q_2^(f) )_A() &=&
   2  3  _2^f  g()_A,m ,  

  (y_2)_AB () &=&
   2  3  _A h() _A,B-1 ,

where

_A ^2 -_A-1 ^2 = m+1-A  ,

for all  except for  w^f_2^2+_m^2 -_m-1 ^2 = 1 , Here  
is any fixed integer such that . 

To find an instanton that interpolate between a giant graviton and
perturbative vacua, we set the boundary conditions,
&&f(-)=g(-)=h(-)=1 ,

&&f(+)=g(+)=
h(+)=0 .
Taking an appropriate sign choice, and writing 
equation for  component-wise, we find
f  = -3  ( f - h^2 ) ,
from all diagonal entries except for  case. The latter gives
a slightly different equation
f  = -3 
     ( f - h^2) + 3 _2^2 (g^2 -h^2) .
Two equations are consistent only if , 
which in turn forces .
Then equations for  and for  collapse to one,
h= - 3 (h-fh) .
Unique solution consistent with the boundary condition is
 f=g=h=1 1+ ((Again, dependence on  is identical to  
case. Value of the Euclidean action also has a simple expression, 

S_E- 1 2  (3  )
Tr  (X_5)^2 _- ^+  . 

This is
essentially of the same form as the Euclidean action in 
 theory. With large , it again scales as 
.

Supersymmetry 

As with  case, instantons of 
theories also preserves some supersymmetry. Euclideanization of
the theory and the supersymmetry
proceed similarly, and we have
_1 &=& i D_X___1 -i _,  ^5 1 2  [X_,X_]
_ _1  +iD^3_1 + (iD^1+D^2)_2 

&&-i 6  _X___5 _1 +i  3  X_5 _1,

_1 &=&-iD_y_i _i - i _y_i]__i + i 6 _5 y_1 _1 +
i 3  _5 y_2 _2  ,

_1 &=& -iD_q_i _i + i _q_iX___i + i 6 _5 q_1
_1 + i 3  _5 q_2 _2  ,

and
similar expressions for , , and
.  are familiar auxiliary fields of
vector multiplet. , , and   are
4-component Dirac spinors from vector multiplet, adjoint
hypermultiplet, and fundamental hypermultiplets.( In
Minkowski signature, they are each symplectic Majorana such that

_1= -iB _2^*, _1=+iB
_2^*, _1=+iB _2^* 

with some
conjugation matrix . Similarly, supersymmetry parameter
 are symplectic Majorana spinors, 

_1=
-iB _2^*, 

Once Euclideanized, however,
this Majorana condition cannot be imposed and we must treat two
components under  index independently. As before, correct
degrees of freedom is found by giving up hermiticity and treating
the path integral as if it is a contour integral.)  To recover
, , and , one must
care to Euclideanize after   performing charge conjugation.
For the instantons in question, this reduces to 

_1 &=& +i D_X_5 _5
_1 +iD^3_1 +i  3  X_5 _1,

_1 &=&-iD_y_2 _2 - i [X_5,
y_2]_5 _2  +
i 3  _5 y_2 _2 , 

_1 &=& -iD_q_2 _2 + i q_2X_5 _5
_2 + i 3  _5 q_2 _2  .

On
shell, the value of  is 

D^3= 12  _f q_2^(f)  q_2^(f) + 1 2  [y_2, y_2 ]  .
Instanton solutions then preserves half of supersymmetry.
Preserved supersymmetry are generated by  and
 where 

_5_i^=
_i^,

which also imply existence of 4 Goldstone
fermionic zero modes generated by the other half 
and . This gives rise to 4 real Grassmannian
collective coordinates, which is free of any interaction vertex.
While larger instanton solutions will admit more zero modes,
bosonic and fermionic, this 4 plus a single bosonic coordinate
from translational symmetry will remain special in that they
remain free no matter what.














Instantons in  and Penrose Limit 

pp-wave background in eleven dimension is obtained from 
 or  by taking the Penrose limit.
Instantons interpolating between giant graviton solutions in 
 spaces were found in. We take Penrose
limit of  space and compare the limiting form of
instantons to those in the BMN M(atrix) theory.

 First, We briefly summarize Penrose
limit of  and . Global metric
for  is

&&F_4 = 3 R_S^3 vol  (S^4) 

&& ds^2 = R_AdS ^2 ( - ^2 d^2 + d^2 + ^2             d _5^2 ) + R_S^2 dS_4^2,
where
 dS_n^2 = d_n^2 + ^2_n^2 dS_n-1 ^2.

Here  and  is
eleven dimensional Planck length.  Penrose limit is taken 
with  ( or  ) following  
the reparametrizations 
 && _i = 2  - y_i R_S  (i=1,2,3) , 

 && = z R_AdS  ,  

 && = x^+ 6  + 6 x^- R_AdS ^2  ,  

 && _4 = x^+ 3  - 3 x^- R_S^2  .  

Finally we get the plane wave geometry 

 && ds^2 = -4 dx^+dx^- - ( (3 )^2 y^2
  + (6 )^2
       z^2 ) dx^+2  +
  d y ^2 + dz ^2,  

 && F_4 = dx^+ dy^1 dy^2 dy^3.
Global metric for  is
 && ds^2 = R_AdS ^2 ( - ^2 d^2 + d^2 + ^2             d _2^2 ) + R_S^2 dS_7^2,  

 && F_4 = 3 vol(AdS_4).  
Here .
Again Penrose limit is taken with the limit  
after the reparametrizations 
 && _i = 2  - z_i R_S  (i=1,, 6),  

 && = y R_AdS  ,  

 && = x^+ 3  + 3 x^- R_AdS ^2  ,  

 && _7 = x^+ 6  - 6 x^- R_S^2  . 
We get the same geometry as
().

 Instanton solutions interpolating between perturbative vacuum and
spherical membranes in pp-wave background have two-fold origins in
 space: (1) One coming from instantons interpolating
between perturbative vacuum and rotating spherical brane in  
of  and (2) the other coming from instantons
interpolating between perturbative vacuum and  rotating spherical brane in
 of . The form of solutions are presented
in. Taking Penrose limit of case (2), we find that the 
limiting form of instanton is identical
to that obtained in Matrix theory : 
   y = R_s p 1 + (/3) , 
 where  is Penrose limit of angular momentum defined in
. Instanton interpolates between  and 
. Value of the Euclidean action is
   S_E 1 6  N p^3 = R_s^3 p^3 6 l_p^3 
  = y_p^3 6 l_p^3  .
 For the case of (1), the Penrose limit of the instanton asymptotes to
   y  R_AdS   p 1 + (/3)   .
  is again angular momentum of giant graviton in the  space. 
Value of the Euclidean action,
   S_E 2  12   N  p^3
  = R_s^3 48 l_p^3  p^3 =
  y_p ^3 6 l_p^3 ,
 so we have the same value of the action both cases. This is
consistent with the fact that we have the same pp-wave limits for
both  and .

As an aside, we may 
consider instanton solutions which interpolate between
perturbative vacuum and spherical fivebranes. Again we note that 
 giant gravitons could arise from two sources: 
(3) fivebranes in  of  and 
(4) fivebranes in  of .
For the case (3), the instanton after taking Penrose limit has the
form
   z^4 = R_s^4 p 1+ (/6)  .
 while the Euclidean action is evaluated to be
   S_E 13  N p^3 2  =R_s^6 96 ^2
  l_p^6  p^3 2 
   =z_p^6 96 ^2 l_p^6 .
 For the case (4), the solution again takes the same asymptotic
form as in case (3). Value of Euclidean action is again,
   S_E 2 3  N^2 p ^3 2  = 2 R_s^6
  3 ^2 l_p^6  p^2 3  = z_p ^6
  96 ^2 l_p^6 .
 As with  case, 
we get the same value of the actions for instantons of different
origins. Note that  for instantons interpolating
between membranes and  for instantons interpolating
between fivebranes. The values of action just count the
corresponding Euclidean volume of bubble creation and agree 
with the dimensional analysis. Recently it was proposed 
that  giant 
graviton vacua and  giant graviton vacua are dual to each other 
in this Penrose limit. This would imply that the two classes
of instantons we considered above should be related to
each other in the Penrose limit. However, the hypothesis 
is not amenable to the naive interpolation of  
giant graviton from  to the Penrose limit.
This fact is also clear from behavior of the instanton
solution above. If there is such a correspondence, it is 
apparently not visible in a semiclassical approach, as was 
noted in Ref. .

Summary 

In this note, we studied Euclideanized 
 BMN M(atrix) theory
and constructed instanton solutions that interpolate between 
classically distinct vacua. We considered two kinds of M(atrix) theory.
One is the original  BMN M(atrix) theory with  supersymmetries, 
while the other with reduced  supersymmetry corresponds
to having longitudinal fivebranes in the background. 

We gave equations for supersymmetric instantons, and solved them for all
possible instantons connecting to the trivial perturbative vacuum. We gave 
detailed counting and, in some cases, explicit construction of zero 
modes around such solutions. This includes Goldstone modes.
and due to some of fermionic Goldstone modes, instantons
cannot mediate mixing of vacua and each classical vacuum remain
robust against quantum tunneling. 
Instantons will certainly contribute to higher order interaction 
vertices, nevertheless. It remains an open question as to 
what specific
roles instantons will play in uncovering quantum nature of BMN 
M(atrix) theory.
