 We find 
a sound wave pole exactly of the form predicted by 
fluid mechanics:
= u_s q - i q^2 + 
O (q^3)  ,
where  is the frequency and 
is the wave vector.  
Moreover, we will see that
the speed of sound
 and the damping  take exactly
the values they should.  In particular,
we find that 
 where  is the number
of spatial dimensions of the theory.   Also,
 is related in a precise way to the 
viscosity calculated in from
the non-propagating shear modes. 

There were two main results of.  The first
was that finite temperature AdS/CFT correspondence can
be used to describe M-brane theories in the hydrodynamic
limit.  Indeed, the AdS/CFT description passed some
nontrivial consistency checks, among them two 
independent derivations of the viscosity.
The second result was more evidence in support of the
Lorentzian signature prescription 
proposed infor calculating
field theory correlators from gravity. 

The two main results of this paper are largely the 
same.  
With sound waves and more internal consistency checks, among
them a third independent calculation of the viscosity, 
we find additional reason to believe that
AdS/CFT describes well the hydrodynamic limit of 
M-brane theories.  This paper also provides further
support for the Lorentzian signature prescription of
.

We begin in section 2 by reviewing shear modes and sound
waves in fluid mechanics and the constraints they
place on the two-point function of the stress-energy
tensor.  In section 3, we discuss the field theory
Ward identities.
We show how these identities constrain the components
of the stress-energy two-point function.  In particular,
the identities essentially 
constrain the infrared behavior of the Green's
functions up to the location of the sound wave pole and
a thermal factor.

Section 4 contains the body of the paper, the calculations
of the stress-energy two-point functions from gravity.
These calculations produce the correct sound wave pole
and match precisely the Green's functions obtained
from the Ward identities.


Sound Waves and the Hydrodynamic Limit 

In the hydrodynamic limit, small perturbations of the
stress-energy tensor from thermal equilibrium correspond
to sound and shear modes.  We review  
the differential equations governing these modes.
We are interested in the thermal field theories living
on M2- and M5-branes.  Thus the stress tensor will be
respectively  or  dimensional.

One of the differential equations is the conservation condition 
.  The second equation
is the linearized form of the stress-energy tensor, which
describes how small, slowly varying 
velocity gradients produce extra
stresses in the fluid because 
of viscosity:

 

where  
is the pressure,  is
the energy density, and  is the viscosity.
The dimension  is 2 for the M2-branes and 5 for the M5-branes, and
, , and  run only over the spatial indices.  To analyze
these equations, it is helpful to split  into 
longitudinal and transverse parts
(see for example):
T^0i  = g_i^(t)  + g_i^()   .

In more abstract language,
we treat  as a one-form that lives in Euclidean
-dimensional space, and we express the form as a sum of a closed
(or longitudinal) one-form  
and a co-closed (or transverse) one-form .  In index notation,
 and 
.

For the transverse or shear modes, the conservation condition and
the linearized stress-energy tensor combine to give 
_0 g_i^(t)  =   +P  (_j)^2 
g_i^(t)   .



In short, the shear modes obey a diffusion law,
and one expects a corresponding diffusion pole
 in the Green's functions
where . 
These modes were 
analyzed in, where it was discovered
from a gravity calculation that 
 
for both the M2- and M5-branes to leading
order in .

For the longitudinal or sound modes, one finds that
(-(_0)^2 + u_s^2 (_i)^2
+2 (d-1) (+P)d  (_i)^2 _0 
) T^00  = 0
along with the subsidiary relation .  We have defined the speed of sound
.  
For a perturbation of the form 
 where 
, there is a dispersion relation of the form
= u_s q - i (d-1) d   +P  q^2 
+ O (q^3)  .
The theories we are considering are conformal and so the stress-energy tensor is traceless.  In other words  and 
.

Ward Identities 

The one- and two-point functions of the stress-energy tensor are 
highly constrained by Ward identities.  
In particular, we will find that the components of the two-point
function relevant to sound propagation are constrained up
to one free parameter .  
In the following, we will 
review the relevant Ward identities and try to motivate
a particular choice of .

In a flat metric,
the Ward identity for  is 
conservation of energy, .
For our thermal field theories,  is a 
constant with  and 
.

For the two-point function,
iG_F^ (q) = 
d^d+1 y  e^-iqy  
T ( T^ (y) T^ (0))  ,
the Ward identity takes a more complicated form:
q_(G^ (q) - ^ 
T^  
-^  T^  +^  T^  ) = 0  .
The conformal invariance of our field theories leads to
an additional conformal Ward identity:
_  G^ (q) = 2 
T^   .
As mentioned before, the Ward identities do not completely
constrain , 
and we have removed the subscript from the Green's function
so that we may think of  as  
any function that
satisfies these identities () and ().




We now identify the particular components of 
 relevant to sound
propagation.
We choose our sound wave to have
wave vector .  In this frame,
we are only interested in components of  which
are invariant under rotations in the remaining  
spatial directions perpendicular to the  axis, i.e.
, , , and 
.
Therefore, there are ten independent correlators
 where  and  are , , , or .

There are twelve Ward identities for these correlators, nine of which are linearly independent.  
Thus, there is a one parameter family of Green's functions
 that satisfy these Ward identities.
Let  be a particular solution to the identities
such that the complex conjugate .
As the identities have real
coefficients,  will
also be a solution, and we can write the most
general solution
as
G = (1+) G_1 - G_1^*  ,
where  is the free parameter.

We now find a particular solution  
such that  with 
a desirable quality:  will be
closely related to the retarded Green's
function .
We expect the only singularities of the retarded 
Green's functions, , to be simple poles at 
, 
corresponding to sound propagation;  is the
damping term.  
Let us assume that  has the same pole structure
as .
With this additional constraint, the correlators become
G_1^ (, q) = P 
(d^2 - q^2) + iq^2  
P^ (, q)
where the  are polynomials in  and .
The constant  is proportional to the damping.
That the  are polynomials uniquely
constrains them to be
 
 
Because they have the same pole structure 
and  are closely related.  However, it was
shown in that the two differ by
real contact terms. 
For example .


















To compare with the gravity calculations
to come, we need an expression for
the Feynman Green's function . 
As the  in the Ward identities are 
defined by
taking functional derivatives of an
appropriately defined path integral,
we expect that one of these solutions
to the Ward identities
should be identified
with the Feynman Green's functions, .
There
must be some  
in ()
for which .





From the definitions of the various
Green's functions and the 
Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) 
condition, we know that
, 
up to real contact terms, where
.
Thus it seems likely that
 in () when , i.e.
G_F = (1+n) G_1 - n G_1^*  .
There has been some guess work involved in arriving
at this expression for , namely in the particular
choice .  However, we will see that this
form for  matches precisely the gravity
calculations in the following section.























Two-Point Functions from Gravity 

In the following, we check that a gravitational
calculation produces stress-energy correlators
that obey the Ward identities.  Indeed,
we will find that the M2- and M5-brane 
correlators calculated from gravity have
precisely the form ().

M2-branes 

The background metric is 
ds^2 = ( 2T R 3u )^2 [
-f(u) dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 ] +
R^2 4 u^2 f(u)  du^2
where ,
and  is the radius of curvature
of AdS.  
We expect the gravitational description of the
M-branes to
be valid in the limit where  is large
compared to the eleven dimensional Planck
length .
The number  of M2-branes is related
to  and  
through Dirac quantization, 
.
Thus, we are working in
the large  limit, and there could 
in principle be  
corrections to our results.

To study the two-point functions
of the stress-energy tensor,
we introduce perturbations to
this background metric of the form
.
We choose a gauge where .  
We consider waves that move in the  direction.
Such waves break into two categories, depending on
whether the metric perturbations are odd or even
under .  The odd perturbations correspond
to diffusive shear waves and were treated in 
.  The even perturbations correspond
to sound waves and will be treated here.
For sound waves, the nonzero elements of 
are , , , and .

We decompose the metric perturbations into their
Fourier components
h_ (t,x, u) = ddq (2)^2  
e^-it + iqx  h_  (, q, u)  .
We also introduce the dimensionless energy and momentum





To first order in the , the Einstein equations
are
 
H_tt " + 1 2u  ( -9 f +7 ) H_tt '
+H_s" + 1 2u  ( -3 f  + 1 ) H_s' = 0  ,
H_tt " + 1 2u  ( -9 f  + 3 ) H_tt ' 
+1 2u  ( -3 f  + 1 ) H_s' - q_2^2 4f H_tt 
+ _2^2 4f^2  H_s + _2 q_2 2f^2  H_xt  = 0  ,
H_s" - 2 u  H_tt ' + 1 u  ( - 3 f  -1 ) H_s'
- q_2^2 4f H_tt  + _2^2 4f^2  H_s - q_2^2 2f H_yy 
+ _2 q_2 2f^2  H_xt  = 0  ,
H_yy " - 1 u  H_tt ' - 1 u H_s' -1 u 
(3 f  - 1)H_yy ' + 1 4f^2 
(_2^2 - fq_2^2 ) H_yy  = 0  ,
H_xt " - 2 u H_xt ' + _2 q_2 4f H_yy =0 , 
q_2(-2 f H_tt ' +3 u^2 H_tt )- 2q_2 f H_yy ' + 2_2 H_xt ' = 0  ,
_2 (2f H_s' +3 u^2 H_s)+ q_2 (2 f H_xt ' + 6 u^2 H_xt ) = 0  .
We have defined  and , , 
.  Here  are the Fourier decomposed 
metric perturbations where the indices have been raised with the background
metric  ().

The system above is not linearly independent, but can be
reduced to the following four linearly independent
differential equations
 
H_tt " + 1 2u  ( -9 f +7 ) H_tt '
+H_s" + 1 2u  ( -3 f  + 1 ) H_s' = 0  ,
q_2(-2 f H_tt ' +3 u^2 H_tt )- 2q_2 f H_yy ' + 2_2 H_xt ' = 0  ,
_2 (2f H_s' +3 u^2 H_s)+ q_2 (2 f H_xt ' + 6 u^2 H_xt ) = 0  ,
4 u  H_tt ' + 1 u  ( 3 f  + 1 ) H_s'
+ q_2^2 2f (H_tt  + H_yy  )
-_2^2 2f^2  H_s - _2 q_2 f^2  H_xt  = 0  .
The five integration constants correspond to the choice of 
incoming boundary condition at  and the four Dirichlet
boundary conditions at .

These systems of differential equations are invariant under
three residual gauge transformations.  These pure
gauge solutions are linear combinations of 
, , and  whose explicit forms are
 
 
 
 
 
 


There is an incoming solution to these differential equations,
where by incoming we mean that the wave fronts at the horizon
are purely incoming.
The incoming solution to linear 
order(
In, the authors used the 
quadratic order solution to 
to compute the correlators and the damping. 
We will see, however, that the 
correct damping appears already at linear order.) 


 in  and  is
 
 
There is also naturally an outgoing solution at the horizon which
is just the complex conjugate of .
The nonperturbative piece  enforces
the incoming or outgoing boundary condition at the 
horizon , as discussed in more detail in
.

Setting the boundary conditions 
is a delicate issue.  In, it was argued that the
correct boundary conditions for calculating field
theory propagators using AdS/CFT are purely incoming for
positive frequency modes and purely outgoing for
negative frequency modes where positive and negative 
frequency are defined with respect to Kruskal time.
Moreover, the full Penrose diagram 
for this black hole background and a second boundary
were used to reproduce the  matrix
of Schwinger-Keldysh propagators.  For simplicity,
we will focus on deriving just the Feynman propagator, 
i.e. the first entry in this 
matrix, in what follows. 

Let  be the solution to the system of ODE's which
contains no  component, i.e.


H(u) = a H^inc (u) + bH^I(u) + cH^II (u) + dH^III (u)  ,
where , , , and  depend on the boundary values
of the bulk graviton field , , , and
 in the limit .
Ignoring the dependence of the propagators on the 
second boundary, 
the bulk-graviton wave-function  with the more complicated
Kruskal time-dependent boundary conditions can be written in
terms of .  In particular, 
where , as discussed in.
As the  can be constructed out of  without
too much difficulty, it is convenient to focus on
.  The fact that  does not rely on the
outgoing piece of the bulk-graviton wave-function means
that it has a causal structure and is thus more closely
connected with the retarded Green's function  
in field theory while  is related to the Feynman
propagator.

Solving this system ()
of equations to linear order in 
 and , one finds that the constants
, , , and  are all proportional to
( (1 + i_2 6  (3) ) 
(2_2^2 - q_2^2) + i q_2^2 _2 3  )^-1   .
 In other words,
the Green's function will have a pole at
= q 2   - iq^2 8T  + O (q^3)
 corresponding
to sound waves with a speed of , 
as expected.  
Moreover, from we know that
.  Thus
the damping term matches
what is expected from the dispersion relation ().

M5-branes 

The calculations for the M5-brane are very similar.
The background metric is 
ds^2 = ( 4T R 3 )^2 1 u  [
-f(u) dt^2 + dx^2 ] +
R^2 u^2 f(u)  du^2
where 
and .  
We introduce perturbations to
this background metric of the form
.
We choose a gauge where .  
We consider waves that move in the  direction.
Such waves break into two categories, depending on
whether the metric perturbations transform as a 
vector or a scalar under the residual rotations
in the directions transverse to  and .
The vector perturbations correspond
to diffusive shear waves and were treated in 
.  The scalar perturbations correspond
to sound waves.
For sound waves, the nonzero elements of 
are , , , and 
.

We again decompose the metric perturbations into their
Fourier components ().
We also introduce the dimensionless energy and momentum





To first order in the , the Einstein equations
are
 
H_tt " - 9u^2 2f  H_tt '
+H_s" - 3u^2 2f  H_s' = 0  ,
H_tt " + 1 u  ( -9 2f  + 2 ) H_tt ' 
+1 u  ( -3 2f  + 1 ) H_s' - q_5^2 uf H_tt 
+ _5^2 uf^2  H_s + 2_5 q_5 uf^2  H_xt  = 0  ,
H_s" - 5 2u  H_tt ' - 3 2u  (  2 f  +1 ) H_s'
- q_5^2 uf H_tt  + _5^2 uf^2  H_s - 8q_5^2 uf H_yy 
+ 2_5 q_5 uf^2  H_xt  = 0  ,
H_yy " - 1 2u  H_tt ' - 1 2u H_s' +1 u 
(-3 f  + 1)H_yy ' + 1 uf^2 
(_5^2 - fq_5^2 ) H_yy  = 0  ,
H_xt " - 2 u H_xt ' + 4_5 q_5 uf H_yy =0 , 
q_5(3u^2 H_tt  -2 f H_tt ')- 8q_5 f H_yy ' + 2_5 H_xt ' = 0  ,
_5 (2f H_s' +3 u^2 H_s)+ q_5 (2 f H_xt ' + 6 u^2 H_xt ) = 0  .
We have defined  and , , 
and so forth as before.  

This system is equivalent to the four linearly
independent equations
 
H_tt " - 9u^2 2f  H_tt '
+H_s" - 3u^2 2f  H_s' = 0  ,

q_5(3u^2 H_tt  -2 f H_tt ')- 8q_5 f H_yy ' + 2_5 H_xt ' = 0  ,
_5 (2f H_s' +3 u^2 H_s)+ q_5 (2 f H_xt ' + 6 u^2 H_xt ) = 0  ,
5 u  H_tt ' + 1 u  ( 3 f  + 2 ) H_s'
+ 2q_5^2 uf (H_tt  + 4H_yy  )
-2_5^2 uf^2  H_s - 4_5 q_5 uf^2  H_xt  = 0  .

These systems of differential equations are invariant under
three residual gauge transformations.  These pure
gauge solutions are linear combinations of 
, , and  whose explicit forms are
 
 
 
 
 
 


The incoming solution to linear order in  and  is
 
 

The solution to this system of ODE's 
with pure incoming boundary conditions at the horizon
is thus a linear combination
of 
H(u) = a H^inc (u) + bH^I(u) + cH^II (u) + dH^III (u)  .
Solving this system of equations to linear order in 
 and , one finds that the constants
, , , and  are all proportional to
( (1 + i_5 3  (3) ) 
(5_5^2 - q_5^2) + 8i _5 q_5^2 3  )^-1   . 

In other words,
the Green's function will have a pole at
= q 5   - i q^2 5 T  + O (q^3)

corresponding
to sound waves with a speed of , 
as expected.  Moreover, the damping term matches precisely
(), given that 
.

Two-Point Functions from the Boundary Action 

Although one can see immediately from the constants 
, , , and  in the solution to the bulk graviton
() and () that the
two-point functions of the stress-energy tensor will
have poles that are consistent with sound wave propagation,
it is a worthwhile exercise to work out the two-point
functions explicitly using the
AdS/CFT prescription.  One benefit is that we will
be able to check the two-point functions calculated
from the gravity against the formulae we derived from
the Ward identities ()-().

In order to use the AdS/CFT prescription, we need
to find the boundary action for our gravitational
systems.  The full action is
R^10-d-1  (^10-d-1 ) 2 _11 ^2 
( d^d+1 x  du 
g  ( R  - 2)
+
d^d+1 x  g^B  (2K + a) )  
where  is a bulk cosmological constant,  is a
boundary cosmological constant that is 
necessary to cancel overall  independent 
divergences in the boundary action,  is the
extrinsic curvature, and  is the metric
on the boundary .
The number  is the volume of a unit
-dimensional sphere.
For , , , and ,
while 
for , , , and .  
The gravitational coupling constant 
is related by Dirac quantization to the number of
M2- and M5-branes.  For the M2-branes,
, while
for the M5-branes, 
.
A more detailed discussion of this bulk
action can be found in 
.


Using the equations of motion, the full
action can be reduced to a boundary term.  
This boundary action for the M2-branes is
 
where the constant  
is the pressure.  


For the M5-branes, the boundary action is
 
where .  We have 
defined .

 
Before looking at the two-point functions, we make two
easy and reassuring observations.  First, the constant term
in the boundary actions is exactly the free energy density, i.e.
minus the pressure, multiplied by the volume, as it should be
. 
As an independent check, the pressure can be 
calculated from the entropy  using
the fact that .  The
entropy for M2- and M5-branes was first determined
in.

The second observation concerns the one-point functions.  
By definition
T^_= 2 S_b H^0_    .
Thus we see that  and
 as they should.

The two-point functions are defined similarly:
T^_T^_=
-4 ^2 S_b  H^0_  H^0_     .
To calculate the two-point functions, we will need to use
our series expansion for , () and 
(), substituting explicit expressions 
for the  in the boundary action. 
Some details of this calculation have been included as an
appendix.
We find that
the resulting two-point functions match the predictions from 
the Ward identities.  In particular, we find
() with  given precisely by 
()-().








Conclusion 

We have succeeded in calculating components of
the stress-energy tensor two-point functions
relevant for sound propagation on 
M2- and M5-branes in the hydrodynamic
limit.  These two-point functions
have poles in the complex
frequency plane in precisely the locations
predicted by hydrodynamics.  Moreover,
the two-point functions calculated
from gravity satisfy the field theory
conformal Ward identities, providing
an elaborate check of the
AdS/CFT correspondence 
at finite temperature.
The agreement between gravity and
field theory gives further support
for the Lorentzian signature prescription
of for 
calculating correlation functions.

Presumably, a general 
statement
can be made that
correlation functions
calculated from 
Schwarzschild black
holes in  of an
arbitrary dimension will
show evidence of sound
propagation.
We have checked
this statement for M2- and M5-branes.
Previously, the statement had been
checked only for D3-branes
.

To see a familiar phenomenon such as
sound emerge from a
poorly understood theory, such as
those that are meant to 
describe M-branes,
is in the author's mind 
interesting and remarkable.
In the M5-brane case, there
is not even a Lagrangian
description, and yet we can
understand sound waves.

An interesting
direction to pursue is gauge/gravity
duality for non-conformal field theories
in the hydrodynamic limit.
The diffusion constants and viscosities
calculated should
exhibit a scale dependence.
One candidate gauge/gravity duality
where we have high temperature
asymptotics 
is the 
finite temperature 
Klebanov-Tseytlin solution
.  We leave investigation
of these issues for future work.

The Bulk Graviton and Correlation Functions 

We present here in more detail some intermediate steps
for calculating stress-energy two-point functions for
M-branes.

By assumption, the bulk graviton components
, , , and  take on the
values , , , and 
at the boundary .  However, to calculate the two-point
functions, we also need an expression for 
at the boundary.


Define 
where .
Then, for the M2-branes, from the solution to 
(), we find
 
 
The ellipses denote higher order terms in , ,
and .  The leading term in  is precisely of
the form to cancel the leading  divergence
in the boundary action ().

For the M5-branes, there is an analogous expression for .
Defining , where now
,
one finds from () that
 
 

The next step in calculating the stress-energy two-point
functions is to insert these expressions for  into
the boundary action
() or (). 
The terms in the boundary action
that produce the two-point functions can be 
represented schematically as  and .  The
 pieces produce constant contact terms.
The  terms, on the other hand, are responsible
for the sound wave pole structure.  

There is an apparent ambiguity how to proceed.
Looking more closely, 
it should not matter at the level of the action whether
the  are written as  or
.  However, sending  sends our
solution .  

Recall that
according to, we should be 
substituting  into the
boundary action, and not just .   is
invariant under the transformation .  
Rather than carry these cumbersome thermal
factors  along, we will adopt the equivalent
procedure of always writing  as
 and using the simpler 
incoming solution .  


Let  be the resulting boundary
action.  We can reconstruct 
by taking functional 
derivatives of 
instead of just .

In this spirit, for the M2-branes,
the  pieces of the boundary 
action become
 
The quadratic terms in  are tacitly assumed to be
of the form .  Also, 
the integral over  and  has been suppressed. 

For the M5-branes, the  piece of the boundary action
is similarly 
 
Recall that  
for these M5-branes.
