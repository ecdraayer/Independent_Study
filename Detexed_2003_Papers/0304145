ABSTRACT
We show that   the scattering amplitude of  four open string
scalars or tachyons on the world-volume of a D-brane in the
bosonic string theory can be written in a universal form. The
difference between this amplitude and the corresponding amplitude
in the superstring theory is in an extra tachyonic pole. We show
that in an  expansion and for slowly varying fields, the
amplitude is consistent with the tachyonic DBI action in which
the tachyon potential is  
with  for bosonic theory and  for
superstring theory. Introduction  Decay of unstable branes is an interesting process which might
shed some new light in understanding properties of string theory
in time-dependent backgrounds-. In
particular, it was pointed out by  Sen  that an effective action
of the Born-Infeld type proposed in can
capture many properties of these decaying processes.
This action for tachyon  and for the transverse scalar fields is
: S&=&-T_pd^p+1 x
V(T)-(_ab +2_a^i_b _i+
2T_b T) ,  where
 is the tachyon potential which is one at unstable vacuum
 and should be zero at the true stable vacuum. Choosing for
the potential V(T)&=&1/( T/),potential  with
 for the bosonic theory and  for the
superstring theory, one finds from above action the correct
stress-tensor in the homogenous time-dependent tachyon
condensation which is a tachyon solution that starts at the top
of the potential at  and then rolls
toward  the true vacuum. More over,  it
has been shown  that the tachyon action with the potential
potential   can be reproduced by nearly on-shell S-matrix
elements of slowly varying tachyon vertex operators in the above
time-dependent background.

It has been  shown in that  all S-matrix elements
involving  four scalar and/or tachyon vertex operators in the
background  in the superstring theory can be written in a
universal form.   The leading terms of the   expansion of
this amplitude  produces correctly the  couplings of four slowly
varying scalar or tachyon fields as well as  a potential for
tachyon which is consistent with the following potential: V(T)&=& e^-( T/)^2 ,potential1 with .  In this paper, we extend this
calculation to the bosonic theory and show that the potential in
this case is again consistent with potential1  with
.

As a warm up in this introduction, we discuss the S-matrix element
of one closed string tachyon vertex operator and two open string
scalar or tachyon vertex operators. These amplitudes are
calculated in. They are(Using the fact that
the closed strings are not functional of the open string tachyon
but are functional of the scalar fields, we assumed
that the closed string field does not depend on the scalar. This
makes similar the S-matrix elements involving the scalars and the
tachyon as much as possible.) : A(,

A(,T,T)&=&

,  are the scalar
polarization vectors in the -dimensional transverse
space, and   are the  momentum vectors in the
-dimensional world-volume space(Our index
conventions are that early Latin indices take values in the
world-volume, , middle Latin indices take
values in the transverse space, , early
Greek indices take values in the (27-(p+1))-dimensional space, , and middle Greek indices take
value in the whole 26-dimensional space of bosonic theory,  ) . The momenta in this amplitude satisfy
the on-shell condition  for the scalar and 
for the tachyon. Now as can be seen, the two amplitudes has the
same dependency on the Mandelstam variable . To write both in a
universal form, we introduce the polarization vectors
 in a -dimensional space
with  polarization of the tachyon.  In terms of these new
polarization vectors, the universal amplitude is, A(_1,_2)&&_1_2((-1-2s) (-s)(-s) )
.axxon The metric used to multiply the
polarizations is .  Note that if we do not
use the on-shell condition for the momenta, the amplitude in this
form is invariant under . Comparing
this amplitude with the corresponding amplitude in the
superstring theory, one finds the following relation:
A^bosonic string   &=&-1 1+2s A^suprstring   .We are interested in the  limit of S-matrix
elements.  To do this expansion, one should first off-shell extend
the amplitude, not using on-shell conditions for the momenta,
then  expand  the gamma functions. At the end one  restricts the
momenta to the  on-shell conditions. The on-shell amplitudes have
in general two kinds of terms upon expanding the amplitude at
this limit. One includes terms like  that do not
depend on the on-shell condition, and the other kind includes
term like  that highly depend on the on-shell condition.
Only these latter terms are different for scalars and for
tachyons. So one may separate the amplitude after 
expansion into  two parts, . The first
part is the same for scalar and tachyon, whereas, the second part
depends on open string states,  when all
states are scalars. Our speculation is that
while the leading  order terms of  for only scalars
are correspond to DBI action,  the same  for scalars and/or
tachyons are correspond to tachyonic DBI action dbiac  with
potential potential1 .

To  expand the amplitude axxon ,  one should first
extend it to off-shell physics. One may write the off-shell
amplitude as the following: A^off  &&_1_2(((-1-2s) (-s)(-s) -G)+G
) ,axxoff where the momenta in this
action do not  satisfy the on-shell condition. The function
 has to cancel non-desirable terms producing by
expansion of the gamma functions in the 
limit, the terms in the first parenthesis being independent of
 , or . Since we are interested in slowly varying
fields we continue our discussion for the leading term of
expansion. For this term the function  should be  G&=&
-Now 
expand the gamma functions in the amplitude, and then go back to
the on-shell physics, A&&_1_2(  (-k_2/2+)+G^on   ),expand where dots represent non-leading terms. The function 
 is  in which the momenta are on-shell, 
 when the two states are scalars and 
when the two states ate tachyons. Now compare it with expansion
of the tachyonic DBI action dbiac (We have used
the fact that the closed string tachyon  normalizes the D-brane
tension as , and we
have kept only linear term for the closed string tachyon.) . The
action dbiac  has the following expansion: S&=&-T_pd^p+1 x(1-T^2+ T)^2+)^2), where  we have used the
expansion  at the top of  the tachyon
potential in this action.   When the polarization vectors in
expand  are in the transverse directions, in the
-dimensional space, the first term of expand 
 reproduces the  kinetic term of the scalar fields. When the polarization
vectors are in the 27-th direction, the first term is reproduced
by the kinetic term of tachyon,  and   term is
reproduced by the tachyon potential. This comparison also
indicates that the tachyon potential does not have linear term
.  In the present paper we would like to extend these
calculation to the case of S-matrix elements of four tachyon
and/or scalar vertex operators.

In next section , we describe the calculation of the scattering
amplitudes in the bosonic string theory, and write the results in
a universal amplitude which is invariant under 
 when the momenta are off-shell. Then in the section
3, using the idea in, we
 off-shell extend the amplitude,  expand it in the limit
, and then back to the on-shell amplitude.
Then compare the leading terms of the expansion with the action
dbiac  and find the coefficient of the  and  in
the expansion of tachyon potential in this action.

Scattering amplitude  Scattering amplitude of four
scalar or tachyon  vertex operators in the bosonic string  theory
is given by the following correlation function:
 A&&dx_1dx_2dx_3dx_4

&&:V(2k_1,x_1):V(2k_2,x_2):V(2k_3,x_3):V(2k_4,x_4):,amp where
V^tachyon  &=&^26  e^2kX ,

V^scalar  &=&^iX_i e^2kX  ,with the world-sheet propagator X^ (x)X^ (y)&=&- (x-y)/2
,where we have used the doubling trick to work with only
holomorphic  functions on the boundary of world-sheet.
Using the Wick theorem, one can easily calculate the correlators
in amp . The different between the tachyon and  scalar
vertex operators is in the extra factor of . However,
because the momenta in the vertex operators are in the
world-volume directions and index  takes value in the
transverse space, the factors  correlate only among
themselves resulting contraction of the scalar polarizations.
Performing the correlation, one finds that the integrand has
 symmetry. One should fix this symmetry by fixing
position of three vertices in the real line. Different fixing of
these positions give different ordering of the four vertices in
the boundary of the world-sheet. One should add all non-cyclic
permutation of the vertices to get the correct scattering
amplitude. So one should add the amplitudes resulting from the
fixing , 
, ,
, ,
. After these gauge fixing, one
ends up with only one integral  which gives the beta function. The
resulting amplitude for scalars and tachyons seems different,
however, using the conservation  of momenta, one can write them
all in a universal form:
 A(_1,_2,_3,_4)&=&A_s(_1,_2,_3,_4)+A_u
(_1,_2,_3,_4)+ A_t(_1,_2,_3,_4),
where , and  are the part of the
amplitude that  has  infinite tower of poles in -, - and
-channels, respectively. They are

polarization vectors of the scalars-tachyon, and the Mandelstam

u&=&-Using conservation
of momenta, one finds that they satisfy the relation s+t+u&=&-i=1 ^4 k_i^2)/2,mandel1 where  for on-shell scalar and  for the
on-shell tachyon.
 We have also
normalized the amplitude aton  by the factor  to
have the complete agreement with the tachyonic DBI action
including the normalization of fields. Note that if one dose not
use on-shell conditions for the momenta, the amplitude aton 
will be invariant under . Also the
amplitude  is symmetric under 
, the amplitude  is symmetric under
, the amplitude  is
symmetric under , and the
whole amplitude  is symmetric under interchanging any particle
label. Comparing this amplitude with the corresponding amplitude
in the supestring theory, one observes the following
relation A_s^bosonicstring  &=&-1 1+2s A_s^supestring  ,

A_u^bosonicstring  &=&-1 1+2u A_u^supestring  ,

A_t^bosonicstring  &=&-1 1+2t A_t^supestring  .Extension of the scattering
amplitude aton  to the noncommutative case is very easy.
One should add just some phase factors to the amplitude, and use
the open string metric in mandel . The above
relation between the amplitude in bosonic and super string theory
remains the same. So one may use the noncommutative results in the
superstring theory and just add the extra tachyonic
pole to find the result in the bosonic theory.


The  expansion and effective action 
Now we would like to expand this amplitude at the limit
. To do this, we should  analytically
continue the amplitude to the off-shell physics, the momenta
do not satisfy the on-shell condition, then expand the gamma
functions. After finishing with the  expansion we go
back to the on-shell physics. In this way, one finds massless
pole and infinite number of contact terms. It was shown in
 that for the non-BPS brane of supestring theory, the
massless pole and contact terms of noncommutative tachyonic DBI
action are produced by  the universal string theory amplitude
expanded  at .

The amplitudes ,  can be read from the amplitude 
by changing the states label, replacing 
  one gets , and replacing 
one gets .  So we continue our discussion only for the 
amplitude. Off-shell extension of  is  A_t^off  &=&4iT_p_1_4_2_3 ((
(-1-2t)(1+t+u-s) (u-s-t) ..atoff 

&&+..(1+t+u-s)(1+s+t-u) (2+2t) 
+(-1-2t)(1+t+s-u) (s-u-t) -3F_t)+3F_t
   ),where the function
 has  to  cancel the non-desirable
 order  terms  resulting from expansion of the gamma
functions in the low energy limit, the first parenthesis must
be independent of  for any .

Aside  from the tachyonic pole in the gamma functions in
atoff , these functions have the following expansion   at
:
 (-1-2t)(1+t+u-s) (u-s-t) &=&-1 1+2t (
1 2 +s-u 2t -
^2 6 ((s-u)^2-t^2)+),

(-1-2t)(1+t+s-u) (s-u-t) &=&-1 1+2t (
1 2 +u-s 2t -
^2 6 ((s-u)^2-t^2)+),

(1+t+u-s)(1+s+t-u) (2+2t) &=&
-1 1+2t (-1-^2 6 ((s-u)^2-t^2)+
),gamma where dots represent terms
that have the Madelstam variables at lest cubic.  Expansion of
the tachyonic pole is also . Unlike the
noncommutative case that each gamma function carries a phase
factor, the gamma functions in the commutative case
atoff  have no such  factors. Hence, the constant and the
massless pole terms in gamma  will be canceled when
inserted into atoff . Up to terms of second order of the
Mandelstam variables, one then left with exactly the same terms
that appears in the superstring case. So  function  is
exactly the one appears in the superstring theory,F_t&=&-6 
(-4 (_i=1 ^4
k_i^2)^2-t_i=1 ^4k_i^2-2 (k_1^2+k_4^2)(k_2^2+k_3^2)
.

&&.
+2 (k_1^2+k_2^2)(k_3^2+k_4^2)+2 
(k_1^2+k_3^2)(k_2^2+k_4^2)
).F We have  only rearranged terms  to
have the symmetry , 
manifest. Now at this point  one should restrict the momenta to
the on-shell to return to the on-shell amplitude. The resulting
amplitude is
 A_t&=&
-12iT_p_1_4_2_3ac41 

&&(^23 (k_2 k_3)(k_1k_4)
-^23 (k_1k_2)(k_3k_4)-^23 (k_1k_3)(k_2k_4)-F_t^on    ), plus some other terms
that are at least cubic in the Mandelstam variables.  These terms
are related to the higher derivative terms in the field theory.
Note that for the four scalar case, the higher derivative terms
are also of higher power of  relative to the terms in
ac41 . However, when one consider four tachyon amplitude,
these higher derivative terms might be of the same order of
 as those  appearing in ac41 , 
 and  are both of the
same order of . However, the second one is very small
relative to the first one for slowly varying tachyon field, in
which we are nor interested in this paper. In the above couplings
 means  in which the momenta are on-shell, F_t^on  =0; &for &_1_2_3_4,

F_t^on  =-^2 3 k_3;&for &T_1_2_3T_4,

F_t^on  =-^2 3 (k_3+k_1k_4+1);&for  &T_1T_2T_3T_4.ft As mentioned before, apart from the on-shell function 
, the amplitude ac41  is the same for scalars and the
tachyons. So the field theory consistent with this part must
contain both scalar and the tachyon in the same footing. However,
  is different for the scalars and for the
tachyons. So this term is responsible for the extra terms that the
field theory produces  due to  the tachyon potential. Now it is
easy to replace the values of  into ac41 ,
add the contribution from , , , and
compare the whole amplitude with the tachyonic action
dbiac . For the case that the four states are tachyons, the
amplitude  simplifies to: A&=&
-16^2iT_p_1^26 _2^26 _3^26 _4^26 (-4 
(k_2k_3)(k_1k_4) -4 (k_1k_2)(k_3k_4)-4 (k_1k_3)(k_2k_4).

&&.+ 4 (k_2k_3+k_1k_4+k_1k_3+k_2k_4+k_1k_2+k_3k_4)+
3 4 ).ac43 Compare it with the
following expansion of action dbiac : S &=&-T_pd^p+1 x
(1-T^2 +T^3+T^4.

&&.+T^a T)
-^2^22 (_aT^aT)^2+),
ltttt where  the constants  and  are
the coefficient of  and  in the tachyon potential,
respectively. One can easily observe that the term with four
derivatives reproduces exactly the four momentum contact terms in
ac43 , term with two derivatives reproduces the two
momentum contact terms, and the  term produces the constant
term in ac43  provided that . Since all
contact terms in ac43  are already accounted for, the
constant  must be zero. Otherwise, the field theory would
produce a tachyonic pole which upon expansion in low energy would
 yield some extra contact terms.

One may expect that extending the calculation here to the
higher-point functions, one would find that the coefficient of
all odd power of tachyon in the tachyon potential are zero. So
the tachyon potential expanded around its maximum, around
, has  the following expansion: V(T)=1-T^2+^2 2 T^4+O(T^6).finalv  This
expansion is consistent with the potential potential1  with
.

Consider the following observations: 1) the off-shell S-matrix
elements involving the transverse scalars and tachyon  are
invariant under  where  is
critical dimension of theory,  2) the tachyon potential  is
an even function of tachyon, 3) the  kinetic term of both scalar
and tachyon appears in the same footing in the effective action
dbiac . Using these,  one may suspect that the tachyon,
like the scalar field, represents a new physical dimension in the
low energy physics. The idea that tachyon might represent a new
dimension was  remarked also in(See
 for a possible geometrical meaning of the tachyon in the
intersecting brane antibrane.) .  Using this idea one may try to
write a covariant action as:S&=&-T_pd^p+1 V(X^2)-(P[_ab ]) ,where  is the
(d+1)-dimensional contra-variant vector, and the pull-back is
P[_ab ]&=&_AB X^A ^a X^B ^b .This
action has global  symmetry, and the gauge symmetry of
world-volume coordinate transformation. Using this latter
symmetry, one can chose the static gauge, .
Letting , the
pull-back becomes P[_ab ]&=&
_ab +2T.The action in this gauge has global
 symmetry, however, because the
actual on-shell potential depends only on the (d+1)-th
coordinate, , this symmetry is
broken to  in the on-shell physics.
