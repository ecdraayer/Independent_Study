The corresponding exact planar one-loop anomalous dimension was 
found in . 
Moving on to the two-loop analysis
we infer from deltaD  and D4  that the matrix 
can be expressed as the square of 
the one-loop matrix dilplanar1 
plus contact-term contributions from DD04 














We now face the problem that the
states OfiniteJ  are no longer eigenstates of , since
 and  do not commute. 
We find










However, we can treat  as a perturbation and thus find
that the two-loop part of the planar anomalous dimension 
is the diagonal piece of  proportional
to .
Exploiting the relation deltaD , 
for the operators whose one-loop form is
given by OfiniteJ  
we obtain the following planar anomalous dimension
exact to two loops








This formula comprises the results 
 in 
eq:singledim  as well as the planar piece in 
 in 
eq:BianchiSingle ,
disexp  and
planarJ5 .
In finiteJ3  we present a conjecture for the planar three-loop
contribution to .
Furthermore, using standard perturbation theory we can also find the 
(planar) perturbative correction to the 
eigenstates OfiniteJ :
They involve the coupling constant dependent redefinition











This -dependent remixing is a complicating feature that 
we can expect at each further quantum loop order; remarkably,
it is absent in the small  limit (i.e. for  (Konishi)
and ) and in the large  (BMN) limit
as discussed in the next section. 



The BMN limit of two impurity operators 

In the BMN limit one is supposed to send  to infinity and consider
only operators for which  is finite . 
More precisely,
the BMN limit is defined as the double scaling 
limit  





In reference  it was shown how the one-loop 
dilatation operator
could be identified as a certain quantum mechanical Hamiltonian
in the BMN limit. Since the same quantum mechanical Hamiltonian turns out
to contain all information about the two-loop dilatation operator in the
BMN limit we shall briefly recall its derivation. 


The one-loop Hamiltonian 

With  being very large
we can view  and  as continuum
variables and we replace the discrete set of states in equation symop 
by a set of continuum states





where




and where it is understood that 

with S  an arbitrary permutation of  elements.

Defining



we can write 
and imposing the BMN limit BMNlim  we get
a continuum version of the equations D20

x;r_1, , r_k ,

d_2;+  x;r_1, , r_k _0^x dr_k+1   _x

x;r_1, , [0pt] r_i ,,r_k .

The -trace eigenstates at  are (with  integer)
(Notice that as opposed to in reference  we use symmetrized
operators and therefore the cosine transform appears.) 






This is of course in accordance with the nature of the exact eigenstates
at finite , cf . eqn. OfiniteJ . 
The inverse transform of fourier 
reads






In the basis fourier  the action of the operator  reads

d_2;0  n;r_1,, r_k2n r_0  ^2 n;r_1,, r_k,


d_2;+   n;r_1, , r_k 8 r_0 _0^r_0  dr_k+1  _m=1 ^

Now, the scene is set for determining the spectrum of the full one-loop
Hamiltonian order by order in  by standard quantum mechanical
perturbation theory and in reference  we carried out
this program for single trace operators to three leading orders in .
Note the great simplicity of the expressions eq.h-on-eigen 
(no contact terms etc.), emerging directly from the study of the
dilatation operator. Rather than comparing specific consequences of
the above equations, and turning around the suggestion in 
, 
we feel that it would be important to derive the above Hamiltonian
in the string field formulation of plane wave
strings 


or the (interpolating) string bit formulation of 
.
 



Two loops 

Proceeding to two loops we define



and we see from equation deltaD  that the only new element in
the analysis is the determination of the BMN limit of the operator
. Now, it follows from the equations in sec:deltaD4 , 
that acting with  on a state of 
the type symop  produces at the discrete level only states in the
combination . Expressing this quantity in terms of the
exact eigenstates at , OfiniteJ , it is easily seen that
in the BMN limit we have
(Notice that  is down
by a factor of  compared to  for general
. In the continuum language this is reflected by the fact that
 which follows from the
relation cosine .) 




Using this result a straightforward scaling analysis of the relations
in sec:deltaD4 
shows that the operator
 becomes irrelevant in the 
BMN limit. 
Thus, in this limit we have



and at any given order in the genus expansion, 
the eigenstates of the one-loop
Hamiltonian are also eigenstates of the two-loop Hamiltonian
(This proves that the  
contribution to the three-point function
of symmetric-traceless operators 
in is indeed correct.
For the singlet or antisymmetric operators this remains
an open question.) . 
For the BMN limit of  one gets up to and including two loops




Writing the BMN double expansion of the conformal dimension of an operator
as





with  the tree-level conformal dimension, what we learned
above can be expressed as





Degeneracies 

 From equation h-on-eigen  it follows that at the planar, one-loop
level we have a degeneracy between states  and
 for which .
Focusing on the simplest case a single trace state  is degenerate
with double trace states of the type  for which 
, with triple trace states  
for which  and so on. 
Notice that degeneracy is excluded for the special case . 
Determining the energy shift of the state  with  to genus one
by treating the term  as a perturbation thus 
in principle requires the use of degenerate perturbation theory. It can be
shown that at order  matrix elements between single trace states
and double trace states vanish .
In contrast, matrix elements between 
states  and  
for  are finite at order . 
So far these degeneracy effects have not
been rigorously taken into account due to the technical obstacles 
caused by the fact that a single trace state is degenerate with a
continuum of triple trace states
(One way to treat 
the degeneracy might be 
to consider the finite  operators discussed 
in sec:twoimp  as  regularized BMN operators 
and then ensure that all
relevant degeneracies are
resolved before taking  to infinity.
For single-trace operators this would require working with  being a
divisor of .) .
Bearing in mind the implications of the finite-
degeneracies, cf . ssec:degen , it is most 
desirable to stringently carry through analysis in 
the large- case as well.



All loop conjecture 

Assuming that the effective vertex idea works at any loop order one would
expect that  encodes all information about the BMN limit of the
dilatation operator in the basis symop . In the BMN limit we
single out those terms of the dilatation operator which produce the
maximum number of  factors. These are the terms with the maximum
number of  constituents. Therefore, only terms of the
dilatation operator which have only one impurity will survive the limit. 
Any such term will appear in some higher power of  and
it has to appear with a weight which ensures
that the planar BMN limit 





is conserved.
Thus, it is tempting to conjecture that the all loop version of the
formula BMNdil 
reads





We now construct a possible all-loop expression for the
one impurity part of the full dilatation generator which
manifestly gives rise to the above
formula in the case of two impurity operators. Iterating the
argument given in the beginning of ssec:bmn  we have
the following simplification when  acts on two-impurity
operators










where





Thus, a possible form for the one-impurity part of the full -loop
dilatation generator is









up to terms irrelevant in the BMN limit.
There might, however, be other combinations which also give
rise to eq:BMNallloop .
At the planar level eq:single-impurity 
is equivalent to
the conjecture of and
the result of.
However, our possible formula would apply to arbitrary genus.
If it was correct, one would be able to
perform all-loop computations not only for
two-impurity BMN operators, but also for more
than two impurities.
There, we do not find a reason why  should be
proportional to  and an individual 
genus expansion would be required each loop level.

The formula eq:single-impurity , if true, 
would also have implications for 
 SYM beyond the BMN limit.
It successfully predicts the dilatation generator at
two-loops completely:
 consists of three parts which can be labelled
as ,  and , the numbers representing the
number of interacting background and impurity fields .
The parts with one impurity are predicted directly,
the part  is related to  by symmetry.
 At the three-loop level all terms
except the terms with two impurities and two background
fields, , can be predicted. As this represents three-loop
interaction between four fields, the corresponding
Feynman-diagrams do not have bulk loops.
The complexity of such diagrams is comparatively low
and a direct computation of coefficients may still be feasible.



Symmetry enhancement at the planar level and integrability 

Let us define a parity operation  acting on traces of group 
generators  by inverting the order of generators within a trace
or, alternatively, by transposing all generators . 
For example





It is easily seen that the dilatation generators 
, ,  commute with the parity operation .
In fact, parity is related to complex conjugation 
on group generators, .
As the dilatation generator  is
real it conserves parity in general





This implies that there is no mixing between operators of
different parity
(The reason why the separation of parities 
has not been an issue so far is that
at least three impurities are required
to allow both parities within the same
 representation.) ,
which was also noticed in.
This parity operation is specific to the  series.
In the  and  series the parity of
a trace of  generators  is given by 
due to the identity 
(A consequence of this is that many of the operators
discussed so far are incompatible with the  and  series.) .

As parity is conserved one should a priori expect that 
the spectra of positive and negative parity operators are not related. 
An example of a system with conserved parity 
is the infinite potential well.
There, the even and odd modes have distinct spectra which are
not related to each other in any obvious way. 
This is what happens in  SYM in general.
If we however consider the strict planar limit, ,
we find that the two sectors are related. 
We observe that, whenever parity even and odd
states have equal quantum numbers (except parity), they form
pairs of operators with degenerate  scaling dimension. 
As a systematic degeneracy almost inevitably indicates a symmetry 
there seems to be a symmetry enhancement in the planar limit of
 SYM. 

We start by discussing the most simple example of such a planar parity pair 
and afterwards we explain the degeneracy at the one-loop level
by means of an integrable spin chain.


Planar parity pairs 

There are three unprotected operators in the 
representation  with .
One has negative parity





and two have positive parity








The scaling dimension for the first is readily obtained 





The dilatation generator acts on the other two as












corresponding to the scaling dimensions 
(the one loop part of which has been found in)






Intriguingly we find that the
scaling dimension of the two single-trace operators,
 and  approach each other
for  at one-loop as well as at two-loop order.
We hence find a pair of operators with opposite parity
which have degenerate scaling dimensions.
This is actually not an exception, it is rather the rule . 
Among the operators in the representations
 with  
we find  pairs of operators and only  unpaired ones,
cf . tab:onetrace , sec:twoimp  and 
sec:anodim . 
And they are not the only examples, we find them
in the representations
(, ),
(, ),
(, ) and
(, ).
In fact, every representation that admits both parities
seems to have such pairs of operators. 
  

 


Single-trace pure scalar operators of 
dimension .
The operators are distinguished by their 
representation and parity.
The protected operators of 
representation  were omitted.
The operators correspond to states 
of a  spin chain of length
. 

This phenomenon is a signal of an enhanced symmetry in the 
planar limit of the  series
(The groups , , although admitting a planar limit, 
do not show this behavior: One of the parity partners is always absent.) .
It cannot be supersymmetry (this time) for a simple reason:
Supersymmetry is independent of the choice of gauge group whereas 
at finite  the operators  mix and have modified
anomalous dimensions. 
Furthermore, for gauge groups other than  the pairs 
cannot even exist.
Therefore the operators  and
 cannot be part of the same supermultiplet.
As the multiplets of this symmetry seem to be either singlets
or doublets the symmetry is most likely abelian.
In the next subsection we proceed by proving the degeneracy
at the one-loop level. 


A conserved charge 

In order to prove the existence of an abelian symmetry 
in the planar sector we will find a generator  and show
that it commutes with the generator of dilatations .
Furthermore, we demand that  anticommutes with the
parity operation  so that it may relate operators of opposite parities. 





We will restrict ourselves to the one-loop level, 
where we can allow all six scalar fields;
mixing with other fields is a higher-order effect.
The degeneracy at the two-loop level will be investigated
in the next section.

We represent a single-trace operator by a cyclic
-vector spin chain of length  
with zero (angular) momentum as suggested by Minahan and Zarembo 
.
The one-loop dilatation operator is then given by 





where  is a local interaction 
linking sites  and  (the sites are periodically identified).
The local interaction  is given by




Here,  is the identity,
 exchanges sites  and  is a
 trace over sites . 
Graphically this may be represented as in fig:oneloopplanar .

 








Graphical representation of the planar one-loop interaction . 


We introduce a generator 






Graphically it may be represented as in fig:bonussym .

 






Graphical representation of the generator . 


This generator is easily seen to anticommute with parity
(it has negative mirror symmetry w.r.t. the 
vertical axis, see fig:bonussym ). 
A straightforward but tedious calculation 
shows that  indeed commutes with .
We will explain this fact in terms of integrability in 
the next subsection,
cf.  eq:superduper .

We note that  interchanges 
 of eq:pairminus  with 
 of eq:pairplus ,






so the generator  is 
indeed responsible for the degeneracy of their scaling dimensions.
The same is true for all the other pairs of operators we observed.
The unpaired operators, for example eq:singleops , are
annihilated by . 
As an aside we note that the eigenoperators are 

(This could also be inferred by demanding that
the eigenoperators be orthonormal and related by .) .
The corresponding eigenvalues of  are 
 in this case.

Thus we have proven the existence of an additional abelian
symmetry in the planar sector at the one-loop level. 
The symmetry generated by , however, cannot be
compact:
The eigenvalues of  are not integer multiples of a common number. 
Nevertheless, one is led to believe that there exists a
 symmetry (not generated by )
which has uncharged singlets and charged doublets. 
Together with the parity operation  it would form the
group O. In this scenario, when  corrections are included,
the group O breaks to the parity .
It would be very desirable to understand this degeneracy/symmetry 
better, in terms of  SYM as well as in terms
of the AdS/CFT correspondence. 
Another peculiarity of the planar sector 
is a recently found degeneracy in four-point 
functions.
There it was observed that for  a four-point function
at one-loop could be described by a single function, although
by superconformal symmetry, two functions would be allowed.
Four-point functions are related to three-point functions and
anomalous dimensions by means of the operator product expansion. 
Therefore these issues might be related in some way.
It would also be of interest to study whether the
degeneracy can be observed as a symmetry of planar
-point functions.






Higher charges of the spin chain 

A much more enlightening way to prove 
is to make use of integrability of the spin chain. 
In it was shown that the
interaction eq:D2spin  has just the
right relative coefficients to exhibit integrability.
The corresponding  matrix is







where  is the local dilatation generator
eq:D2spin  acting on an auxiliary site , 
see for details. 
This  matrix satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation for the  case







and thus gives rise to an integrable spin chain.
Integrability predicts the existence of a tower
of commuting charges . The zeroth charge is 
the cyclic shift, it equals 
the identity in the zero (angular) momentum sector. 
The first charge is identified with the dilatation generator





up to a constant. 
Using the expressions in we find for the
second charge





 From the fact that  and  commute we easily derive 






We have seen that the second charge of the integrable spin chain
has important consequences. It is thus natural to 
investigate the third charge . Up to polynomials
in ,  and  we find some generator  which
commutes with ,  and parity .
In contrast to  we find that  does not pair up
operators, it simply assigns a number (charge) to each operator.
This is in fact what is to be expected. 
The reason why  was interesting is that it 
anticommutes with  while  commutes thus giving rise to pairs. 
The next charge, , will again give rise to some new
generator, , that anticommutes with parity. This generator will 
relate the same pairs, only with different coefficients (charges). 
Due to eq:firstcharge  we know that the spectrum 
of  is related to the spectrum of one-loop 
anomalous dimensions. A natural question to ask is whether
the spectra of the higher charges , , , 
have a physical meaning in the gauge theory. Except for special classes of operators,
the two-impurity operators for example, we find no obvious relation
between the spectra of  and . 
Thus, there might be some non-trivial
information contained in the higher charges. 
Clearly, the deep question is why  integrability 
emerges from the planar gauge theory.


Integrability at higher loops 

In the previous section we have found planar parity pairs and
justified their existence using integrability at the one-loop level. 
At the two-loop level integrability has not been established yet.
An obstacle in doing so is that two-loop interactions are
interactions of next-to-nearest neighbors, whereas 
an integrable spin chain usually involves nearest neighbor interactions only.
Although some next-to-nearest neighbor interactions are included
in the tower of higher charges, these cannot be related to the
two-loop dilatation generator, because  and  do not commute 
while the spin chain charges do.
In order to construct an integrable spin chain with non-nearest
neighbor interactions we cannot make direct use of the
R-matrix formalism and the Yang-Baxter equation.
However, we may use our discovery of degenerate pairs in the previous section 
as the starting point.
Integrability at one-loop gives rise to a conserved charge .
The charge anticommutes with parity 
and thus pairs up operators.
By promoting  and  to their full counterparts
 and  we may generalize the integrable 
spin chain to higher loops or non-nearest neighbor interactions. 
The observed degeneracy at the two-loop level 
is a clear indication that a conserved  exists up to two-loops.

By going to the two-loop level we again restrict ourselves to the operators
described in ssec:purescalars . Effectively this means we 
consider a XXX ( spin ) spin chain 
which does not have the trace term.
We can now represent all interactions by means of permutations
of adjacent sites. A generic term will be written as





In this notation the one-loop dilatation generator 
(we will drop factors of  in this section) and the 
charge  are given by 






We start by showing that the degeneracy of parity pairs
holds at two-loop.  From the assumption that 
planar  SYM is integrable at three-loops
we derive the corresponding dilatation generator. 
Then we investigate the constraints on the four-loop dilatation 
operator and conclude
with an analysis of a tower of special three-impurity operators. 


Two-loops 

At the two-loop level we have found that the dilatation generator 
 receives the correction





and we expect that also 
receives some correction . 
For the degeneracy to hold at the two-loop level 
we have to find a  such that 





We find that this is satisfied by





This proves the degeneracy of anomalous dimensions 
at two-loops.
In performing the commutator we were required to make use of
the impossibility of three antisymmetric spins in .
This indicates that for spin chains with next-to-nearest neighbor
interactions, integrability requires that 
for each site there can only be two states,
i.e. a  spin chain.
This, however, does not exclude that integrability
extends to all six scalars of SYM. When the other scalars
are included, we have to consider fermions and derivative
insertions as well. This might be, roughly speaking,
a  spin chain.
The interactions involving all
relevant fields might then be integrable.
At least for the superpartners of the
operators under consideration this must indeed be
the case due to supersymmetry.

In addition we have found the extension 
of the third charge  to two-loops,
see sec:highercharges . 
This suggests that also
the higher charges will generalize to at
least two-loops.
If this is indeed so it justifies our claim that 
planar  SYM at two-loops is integrable.
It is thus natural to conjecture that 
integrability holds at all-loops. 
This would mean there exist 
infinitely many commuting charges  with
loop expansion






where  and .
Considering the structure of 
the first few known terms
we assume that  is composed of
up to  permutations involving up to
 adjacent sites. 
For  odd the interactions are
symmetric and parity-conserving,
and for  even they are 
antisymmetric and parity-inverting. 
Note that in the latter case this implies
a vanishing constant piece.



Three-loops 

In this subsection we investigate the constraints on the 
planar dilatation generator at three-loops due to 
integrability. This requirement together with the
correct behavior in the BMN limit, eq:BMNsz ,
fixes  completely. 
This is not supposed to imply that the  we derive 
is the correct planar dilatation generator of  SYM. 
It may well be that the degeneracy of pairs is broken at
three-loops.

As building blocks for the three-loop interaction we allow
symmetric (with respect to the order of permutations 
 to
ensure a real spectrum) and parity-conserving 
(positive symmetry under )
structures.
These should act on only four adjacent sites and have no more than
three permutations. This follows from the general structure of a
connected three-loop vertex. 
We find exactly six structures that satisfy these constraints.
Using the planar BMN limit eq:BMNsz 
we can fix the coefficients of four of these structures. 
The requirement of pairing for three-impurity operators at dimension 
 and ,
see ssec:planardegen  and
eq:dim8pair  fixes the remaining two. We find











The associated correction to  
can be found in much the same way 
analyzing all possible antisymmetric, parity-inverting structures
and requiring that  and  commute.
This fixes  up to a contribution proportional 
to the fourth charge at one-loop . 
Acting on the Konishi descendant  we 
find the three-loop planar contribution to its scaling dimension








subject to the assumption made at the beginning of this subsection.
It is also 
worth noting the contribution to a general two-impurity operator.
Up to a piece proportional to  we find some contribution in 
the upper-left  block (and equivalently in the
lower-right  block)













in analogy to eq:dD4mat .
Considering now both  and  as perturbations of  
(cf . ssec:TwoImpPlanar ) we can obtain 
the planar three-loop contribution to the
anomalous dimension of the operators OfiniteJ . 
We get one
contribution
from the diagonal part of  and one contribution from the
off-diagonal part of  as encoded in the usual formula for second
order non-degenerate perturbation theory. The final result reads 








and it produces the correct result for all values of ,
even for the Konishi eq:kon3  at , .

Using the planar three-loop dilatation generator
it might be possible derive the non-planar version
by analyzing all possible diagrams and fitting their
coefficients to non-renormalization theorems and the
planar version in analogy to sec:twoloop .


Four-loops 

Having convinced ourselves of the usefulness of the constraints
from the pairing and the BMN limit we cheerfully proceed to 
four-loops, just to find that all coefficients but one are fixed. 
Unfortunately, the left-over coefficient does influence 
most four-loop anomalous dimensions, in particular the one of the Konishi
descendant  
(It is not even clear how to treat , because the
interaction is longer than the spin chain in this case.) .
The consideration of higher charges might fix this remaining parameter.
Nevertheless, we will see below that we are able to 
find special operators for which the
four-loop
scaling dimensions turn out to be independent
of the so far undetermined parameter. 

At four-loops we find
in total twelve independent structures.
Five coefficients can be fixed using the planar BMN limit 
eq:BMNsz . Further five coefficients
are fixed by demanding degeneracy of pairs.
An expression for  involving the remaining
two coefficients  can be found in sec:highercharges .
Evaluating some eigenvalues of  up to four-loops
one observes that they do not depend on the parameter . 
This behavior is however expected. At four loops we have the
freedom to rotate the space of operators with the orthogonal 
transformation generated by the antisymmetric 
generator . This gives rise
to the following similarity transformation 





The first term in  due to the transformation is





and this is proportional to what multiplies  in . 
Now, as  and  are related by a similarity transformation,
their eigenvalues are equal and  only affects the
eigenvectors, but not the eigenvalues.


A tower of three impurity operators 

For  odd we observe that there are as 
many even operators in the 
representation  as there are odd ones.
For a complete table of spin chain states, up to dimension 12,
see tab:onetrace . 
If  is even the same is true except for 
one additional operator with negative parity. 
This additional operator is 




which is an exact planar eigenoperator of  with eigenvalue .
The lowest dimensional example at  was
discussed in ssec:Dim234 .
It is annihilated by the extra symmetry generator , i.e. it is 
unpaired.
Note, that for all of these operators two of the impurities 
are always next to each other. 

The operators  are not exact planar eigenoperators of . 
Nevertheless, we can project  to the piece 
proportional to  and find  as the coefficient. 
Consequently we have found a sequence 
of operator with planar dimensions





Interestingly, the anomalous dimension does not depend on the
bare dimension . In that sense, this operator behaves much like 
the highest mode in the series of 
two impurity operators discussed in 
sec:twoimp . Assuming the
highest mode number were  
(The corresponding operator does not exist.
The highest mode number is , for which, however,
the anomalous dimension does not differ considerably.) ,
the anomalous dimension andim 
would equal ,
which is also independent of . 
Furthermore, the frequency of the phase factor 
in OfiniteJ  would also be extremal as in eq:special3op .

For a few of the lower dimensional operators we can also evaluate 
the anomalous dimensions up to four-loops 
(subject to the assumptions in deriving the 
corresponding vertices). Here, the yet undetermined coefficient
 does not contribute.
Intriguingly we find 






for .
For  the four-loop contribution differs






while for  also the three-loop contribution is modified






So the following picture emerges: 
The -loop anomalous dimensions for the operators
of dimensions , 
seem to be equal. 



Conclusions and outlook 

The main message of this paper is the proposal that perturbative
scaling dimensions in 4D conformal gauge theories should not  be 
computed on a case-by-case basis, using the standard, very laborious 
procedure. The latter consists in first working out classical and quantum 
two-point functions of a set of fields, subsequently
recursively diagonalizing and renormalizing the fields at each
order in the gauge coupling  in order to find "good" conformal
fields satisfying the expected diagonal form in eq.two  to
the desired order, and finally extracting the scaling dimensions from
eq.two . Instead one should focus on the dilatation operator
relevant to the general (i.e. possessing an arbitrary engineering 
dimension) class of operators under study. Once it is found,
to the desired order in ,
the computation of the dilatation matrix becomes a straightforward, purely
algebraic  exercise. The subsequent calculation of the eigenvalues
of the matrix then yields the scaling dimensions, while the
eigenvectors resolve the mixing problem. 

In the present work we
illustrated this proposal in a specific example: We obtained the
dilatation operator up to  of  
Yang-Mills theory for arbitrary traceless pure scalar
fields, cf . eqs.introD4 . However, we certainly believe
that our methodology is rather general and should therefore be equally
applicable to other four-dimensional conformal gauge theories with
less supersymmetry.   


In order to save us a significant amount of additional work we did use 
non-renormalization theorems as well as recent results
on the scaling dimensions of the so-called BMN two-impurity operators
 to fix
constants in our two-loop dilatation operator. Incidentally, this
may serve as an interesting illustration how the AdS/CFT 
correspondence (here in its latest reincarnation, i.e. the
plane wave/BMN correspondence) can lead to new insights into
gauge theory. We then went on
to apply our example to a large number of situations of interest,
obtaining with ease a host of novel specific results 
for anomalous dimensions and for the resolution of mixing of 
scalar operators.
This yields important new information on the generic structure
of : E.g. the degeneracy of certain single and double-trace
operators leads to unexpected  terms in the associated
anomalous dimensions, and to the breakdown of a well-defined double expansion
in the 't Hooft coupling  and the genus counting
parameter . One surely very
interesting issue we did not yet address is the interpretation of
these effects in the light of the AdS/CFT correspondence.

Our new results on  SYM  already lead to new insights into the
plane wave strings/BMN correspondence. We were able to extend our quantum
mechanical description of BMN gauge theory ,
deriving
from the two-loop dilatation operator the two-loop contribution to the
quantum Hamiltonian. This contribution strongly hinted at an all 
genera version of the celebrated all loop BMN square root formula, 
cf . eqn. eq:BMNallloop . Whether 
this generalization withstands closer scrutiny remains to be seen, of course.

It would also be very helpful to develop techniques similar to the
ones presented here for the efficient evaluation of correlation
functions of more than two local fields. It is e.g. well known
that conformal invariance completely fixes the space-time form
of three-point functions ()










Therefore the quantities of interest are the finite structure
constants  alone.
These constants appear in the operator product expansion
and apart from the scaling dimensions they
are the other central quantity in a conformal field theory of
local operators
(
A number of structure constants
for two and three impurity BMN operators

have been obtained so far. 
In terms of the BMN correspondence it
would be important to understand their
dual on the string theory side.) . 
However, in order to really obtain this form one has to use the correct
eigenstates of the dilatation operator. Furthermore, standard perturbative
computations are "contaminated" by useless finite and divergent 
contributions from the perturbative expansion of the 
weights . One therefore wonders whether one may
generalize our methodology and develop purely algebraic techniques 
for directly finding the structure constants.
Of equal interest are four-point functions, which also seem
to possess many unexpected, simplifying features waiting to be
explored (see e.g. ).

By exploiting the recently discovered description of the planar
limit of the one-loop dilatation operator as the Hamiltonian of an 
integrable spin chain  
we pointed out the existence of a new axial symmetry
of  Super Yang-Mills theory at , linking fields 
of opposite parity (w.r.t. reversing the order of fields inside
SU traces). 
We were able to prove the symmetry as a direct consequence of
the presence of non-trivial charges commuting with the Hamiltonian.
We furthermore derived this to follow immediately from
the existence of an -matrix
satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation,
i.e. from the integrability discovered in. 
An exciting open question is 
the interpretation of this symmetry (and of the integrability in
general) from the point of view of the planar gauge theory, or possibly from
the point of view of its dual string description.
This is even more pressing as we found much evidence that this integrable
structure extends to two loops (we did prove that at least two further
charges commute with the two loop dilatation operator) 
and it is obviously tempting to
conjecture that it holds to all loops.
One could therefore hope that a proper understanding of the integrability
might lead to the exact construction of the all-order planar
dilatation generator, see also the discussion below.



It would be important to extend the methods of this work
to fix the remaining terms 
in the dilatation operator eq.dilexp  pertaining to further 
classes of operators such as scalars with  traces, 
fermions, field strengths or covariant derivatives.
The latter would be interesting in order to study the 
high spin limit of, see also 
. 
Here we expect the superconformal symmetry of the model to be helpful.
It would also be fascinating to investigate whether the 
reformulation of the planar theory 
as an integrable spin chain can be extended to include the other fields.

It is striking that, once the dilatation operator is found, the 
calculations of anomalous dimension matrices become purely
algebraic. However, in order to fully justify its derivation
we did need to take a look at two-point functions 
(cf . sec:oneloop ,). It is natural to wonder whether
there are further shortcuts that leads to the determination of the
terms in the perturbative expansion of the dilatation operator 
eq.dilexp . For the  model this is not an
unreasonable expectation: First of all, the theory is scale-invariant
on the quantum level and therefore possesses a finite dilatation
operator. Thus one
could expect that the renormalization procedure of 
sec:oneloop , is only a scaffold that
one might be able to avoid. Secondly, the theory's action is unique,
and entirely determined by the maximal superconformal symmetry
. Is there a way to use the symmetry algebra,
possibly paired with some further insights into the  model,
to completely fix the structure of the dilatation operator dilexp ? 

We would certainly like to push our procedure to higher loops.
This is not a 
pointless exercise. E.g. little seems to be known about
the analytic structure of the exact  anomalous dimension
of low dimensional fields such as Konishi. All we currently have is
the two-loop result eq.Kontwoloop , the planar
three-loop conjecture eq.Konthreeloop 
 and the conjectured 
(from AdS/CFT) strong coupling behavior 
. Knowing further terms
in the perturbative expansion might give essential clues about
the convergence structure of the series (is the radius of
convergence zero or finite?) and might allow us to estimate
the strong coupling result by Pade approximants. Incidentally,
the Konishi field eq.dimtwo  is particularly interesting
as it cannot mix with any other fields and is therefore known to
be an exact eigenstate of the dilatation operator to all
orders in perturbation theory.


We have taken  first steps towards constraining the complete dilatation
operator, building directly on 
the consequences of
the spin chain picture: Assuming the above mentioned axial 
symmetry to
hold also beyond two loops we were able to derive a planar version of
the three-loop dilatation operator which in turn allowed us to obtain
further results on anomalous dimensions. A preliminary study of the
possible planar four-loop structures showed that the information which
completely fixed the three-loop case leaves one coefficient of the
planar four-loop dilatation operator undetermined. A speculation of,
potentially, tremendous importance would be that imposing the full
integrability structure completely fixes, at each loop order, the exact
planar dilatation operator.

Renormalization at higher loops 

To obtain the arbitrary loop correlator we insert
all -loop connected Green functions  
in the correlator







In analogy to eq:oneloopV  we change 
the argument  of

Alternatively, we could change the argument

We would then like to rewrite
eq:allloopWsub  in a convenient form for
the conformal structure of the correlator:







where 





The terms  are defined by the equality of 
eq:allloopWsub  and eq:nloopV 






which will have to be solved perturbatively. All
the terms that arise due to normal ordering of the exponential
and the commutator terms in eq:Vndef  need to
be absorbed into the definition of higher order vertices.
For example, the two-loop effective vertex is






The commutator terms in eq:Vndef  were included for 
convenience, we will explain this issue below.
The symmetry of  is translated into the 
effective equality





In fact we can introduce a transpose operation 
on a generator  by the definition 





In other words, letting  act on 
is equivalent to letting  act on .
The symmetry of the vertices translates to 






We renormalize the operators according to 





with 





This gives







We can commute objects with a  and a  index freely and 
use the transpose operation eq:transpose 
to make  act on  instead.
We get







The vertices  in  are symmetric, eq:Vsymtranspose , 
only the commutator in eq:Zndef  requires special 
care, because  and  need to be transformed
consecutively. This effectively inverts their order and
flips the sign of the commutator:





In a renormalizable field theory the dependence of  on  is
determined, we write






We combine the last three exponentials in eq:nloopVrenorm2 
into one with exponent







The -loop Green function  is expected to have multiple poles
at .
In a conformal field theory, however, these poles
must have cancelled in the combination 
as given by eq:Vndef , eq:Vn .
If so, we can finally send the regulator to zero and find 







with 





Note that the commutator term in 
eq:nloopVrenormexp  vanishes due to four powers
of  from  opposed to only three powers
of  from the .
For this cancellation to happen the commutator terms in 
eq:Vndef  and eq:Zndef  are necessary
(We have investigated all possible terms that arise in a four-loop
computation. We found that
exactly the commutator structure in eq:Vndef  
was required to obtain a finite, conformally covariant
correlator.) .

Some comments about the renormalization program are
in order. 
The effective vertices  are connected diagrams.
They are generated from the Green functions  
by removing the normal ordering of an exponential
eq:Vn 
and adding commutators eq:Vndef .
One can easily convince oneself that these operations
produce connected diagrams.
The same is then true also for the dilatation generator .
Secondly, the program ensures that the coefficient
of the two-point function is given by 
free-contractions of the unrenormalized operators.
Thirdly, the effective vertices  are 
symmetric with respect to the scalar product induced
by free contractions, see eq:Vsym .
The same holds for the dilatation generator
which consequently has real eigenvalues
(Some eigenvalues may appear to be complex.
This can only happen if the corresponding 
eigenvector has zero norm. In this case
the operator in fact does not exist.
This happens if the rank of the group is small
compared to the size of the operator. 
Then group identities make some operators
linearly dependent.) .


A collection of anomalous dimensions 

Away from the unitarity bounds 

The following operators have a form similar to
the ones discussed in sec:intro .
As they contain all six scalar fields and 
traces they mix with operators containing fermions and
derivatives,
see ssec:purescalars .
This mixing, however, only becomes relevant 
beyond one-loop and we can determine 
their one-loop anomalous dimensions using 
eq:D2 .

Dimension 5,  

We find three single-trace and three double-trace operators
with dimensions

&&^6 
-250-4850 N^2 +1600 N^4  
-3750 N^2 -4000 N^4  =0.


Two of these operators,
a single-trace and a double-trace one, 
are degenerate in the planar limit.
The degeneracy is lifted by  corrections
and the t' Hooft expansion of their 
scaling dimension is subject to the
issues discussed in ssec:degen .
