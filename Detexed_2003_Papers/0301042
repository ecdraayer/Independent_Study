We investigate the previously proposed cyclic regime of
the Kosterlitz-Thouless renormalization group (RG) flows.  
The period of one cycle is computed in terms of the RG
invariant. Mapping this theory to the sine-Gordon model, 
we conjecture a particle spectrum and S-matrix.  The
S-matrix has an infinite number of resonances with masses that have
a Russian doll scaling behavior that is consistent with the 
period of the RG cycles computed from the beta-function.
Closure of the bootstrap for the S-matrix leads
to an infinite number of particles of higher spin with 
a mass formula suggestive of a string theory.

Introduction 


The Renormalization Group (RG) continues to be one of the most important
tools for studying the qualitative and quantitative properties of quantum
field theories and many-body problems in condensed matter physics.
A widely  important class of theories are those with RG fixed points in
the ultraviolet (UV) or infrared (IR), and our intuitive understanding
of the generic behavior of quantum field theory is largely based on
theories with these properties.  The notion that massive states
decouple in the flow toward the IR is an example of such an intuition. 
However fixed point behavior is not the only possibility, and physically
sound examples with other kinds of behavior are important to explore.  
This paper is concerned with cyclic   RG flows, 
whose possibility was considered as early as 1971 by Wilson.
However at the time no interesting models were known that exhibited
this behavior. 

Recently a cyclic RG behavior has been found in a number of models,
wherein the couplings return to their initial values after a 
finite  RG time :
g(e^L ) = g(L),
where  is the RG length scale .
The models in  are problems in zero-dimensional
quantum mechanics.  The model in  is a natural extension 
of the BCS model of superconductivity and thus a many-body problem. 

The cyclic RG property eq. () has some important implications
for the spectrum of the hamiltonian.  Namely, if 
 is the spectrum of eigenvalues of 
the hamiltonian for a system of size , then 
 E_n , g, e^L  =   E_n , g,  L ,
i.e. the energy spectrum at fixed  should reveal 
a periodicity as a function of .  A nice feature of the
model in  is that in addition to the beta-function with
the cyclic property one could obtain analytic results for the spectrum 
using the standard BCS mean field treatment.  In this way one could study
the interplay between the cycles of the RG flow and the spectrum.  
The manner in which the spectrum reproduces itself after one RG cycle 
is dependent on the existence of an infinite number of eigenstates 
with the 'Russian doll' scaling behavior in an appropriate limit
E_n+1  e^E_n .
In each cycle these eigenstates reshuffle themselves such that the
'th state plays the same role as the 'th state of the previous
cycle.  

The models considered in  on the other hand are relativistic
models of quantum field theory in .  What is surprising is that
this theory is in fact a well-known theory that arises in a multitude
of  physical
problems: an anisotropic 
 left-right current-current interaction that gives rise to
the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) flows.   The standard picture of these
flows, based on the one-loop approximation,  is shown in figure 1.  
The  axis is a line of IR or UV fixed points.  The flows
in the region  on the other hand are already
peculiar in that they both originate and terminate at no clearly
identifiable fixed point.  In it was proposed that this
region has a cyclic RG flow based on the all-orders beta-function 
conjectured in.  However since the flows extended beyond
the perturbative domain , it remained
unclear whether other non-perturbative effects would spoil
the cyclicity.  Furthermore, at the time little was known about the
spectrum.    In any case, if  this proposal is correct it implies
that an important feature of the KT flows has been
overlooked.

Kosterlitz-Thouless flows.  



The main purpose of this article is to provide further evidence
for the cyclicity of the KT flows by investigating the spectrum.  Let
us summarize our main results.  In theories with UV or IR fixed points
the universal properties encoded in the beta-functions are anomalous
dimensions of fields which are related to the slope of the beta-function
at the fixed point.  On the other hand, for a cyclic flow,  the only
universal, coordinate independent property is the period of one cycle. 
We compute the period  in section II in terms of the
RG invariant  
 (at small coupling 
), 
and find the result
.    

In section III we bosonize the currents and obtain a sine-Gordon
theory with a special form of the sine-Gordon coupling with both
real and imaginary parts. (See eq. ().) Other regimes
of the KT flows are known to have an exact S-matrix description
corresponding to the sinh-Gordon and massive/massless sine-Gordon
theories.  In section IV, using symmetry arguments and known results on the
XXZ Heisenberg spin chain, we propose an S-matrix for the cyclic
regime.  The only free parameter of this S-matrix
is  which governs the period of the RG cycles.
 The  S-matrix commutes with the  
quantum affine symmetry,  where  is real .  



 The soliton  S-matrix possesses poles
which  imply the existence of an infinite number of  resonances 
with mass
m_n = 2 M_s n   ,       n= 1, 2, 3, ..., ,
where  is the mass of the soliton.  We show that these resonances
are actually  a spin 1 triplet and a singlet.
The above spectrum, eq. (), which is rather novel in the subject
of integrable quantum field theory, is the Russian doll spectrum that
was anticipated based on the analogy with the results in .
Namely, 
m_n M_s  e^n /  m_n+2  e^m_n ,      n    ,
to be compared with eq. ().   This property of the spectrum
is a strong indication of the cyclicity of the RG.
  
We find  that closing the S-matrix
 bootstrap leads to resonances of higher spin
with a mass formula that suggests a string theory description. 
Theories with an infinite number of resonance poles were also
found in; however these theories 
appear to be rather different, the S-matrices being built out
of elliptic functions.  


In section V we show that the cyclic regime of the KT flows corresponds
to the anti-ferromagnetic regime  of the XXZ Heisenberg
chain.
In terms of , we show that the period of a cycle is
= ^2 ^-1  (-)  .
To our knowledge a cyclic RG has not been observed before for
this spin chain, so clearly we needed to obtain some new results for
this model despite the fact that it is integrable and has been studied
extensively for many decades.   We show that there exists 
a particular continuum limit of the S-matrix on the lattice
 that leads to our conjectured S-matrix. 
However we emphasize that the short distance properties of the theory 
based on our continuum S-matrix goes beyond the lattice formulation
of the XXZ spin chain because of the nature of this continuum limit. 

In section VI we make a comparison between
the results obtained in this paper and those
in reference  concerning the Russian doll BCS
model which also possess a cyclic RG. Finally, in section VII
we state our conclusions and address some open questions. 






Cyclic RG flows in anisotropic  current perturbations 



We define the couplings ,  as the following 
current-current perturbation of the  level  Wess-Zumino-Witten
(WZW) model:
S = S_WZW  + 
,
where  ()  are the left (right) -moving currents, 
normalized as in .


Let us first consider the well-known one-loop result. The beta functions
are 
d dl  = - 4 ^2 , d dl  
= - 4 , 
where the length scale is , with  a microscopic
distance. We will refer to  as the
RG 'time'.    The flows possess the RG invariant:
Q = ^2 - ^2, 
so that the RG trajectories are hyperbolas.
We are interested
in the region  where  is negative.  Let us
parametrize  as follows: 
Q -^2 16  , Q  i  4 ,
where .  Eliminating , one finds 
d dl  = -4 .
This is the same beta-function as in .  The latter is
easily integrated:
(l) = -  4  ((l - l_0 )),
where  is a constant.  One sees from eq. () that 
 flows to  then jumps to  and begins a new
cycle. The periodicity of the RG flow is
 where
.  

Though the 1-loop RG already indicates a cyclicity, since the flows
extend outside of the perturbative domain  one cannot
conclude the flows are indeed cyclic based on the 1-loop approximation. 
However it was shown in  that the cyclicity persists to 
higher orders in perturbation theory, as we now review.  



The all-orders beta function proposed
in  is 
d  dl  = -4 ^2 (1+)^2   (1-^2 )^2  ,
d  dl  =  -4 (+ ^2 )  
 (1-^2)(1-)  .

A few remarks on the status of the conjectured beta-function eq. ()
are in order.  A number of important checks were performed in .  
The most sensitive check was of the massless flows
that arise in the imaginary sine-Gordon theory defined by 
 .  The above beta-function
correctly predicts the known non-perturbative relation between 
the anomalous dimensions in the UV and IR.  An all orders beta-function
was also proposed by Al. Zamolodchikov , 
  and his result was quoted in .  
Zamolodchikov's argument was global in nature
and did not rely on summing up perturbation theory; the main input was
the known properties of the massless flows, thus his beta-function 
appears to be the unique one up to a change of coordinates that captures
the non-perturbative aspects of the flows.   It can be shown that
the beta-function in  is equivalent to () 
under a change of coordinates.  Recently it has been argued that
there are additional contributions that first arise at 4-loops . 
Though this would seem to spoil the properties of the massless flows, 
arguments were given in  that the new contributions would not. 
This is a rather technical issue and consequently we will assume the
above beta-function is correct.  Clearly, the present work
is a further check of the global properties of the conjectured
all-orders beta function.    



The RG flows were analyzed in detail in .  It was shown there
that though the beta function possesses poles at ,  the flows
approach the poles along non-singular trajectories and can be extended
to all length scales.  The analysis of the flows is simplified by 
recognizing that they possess a non-trivial RG invariant: 
Q =   ^2- ^2 (1+)^2 (1-^2)  .
(We have rescaled  by a factor of 16 in comparison to .) 

Q  

One can use  to eliminate , obtaining 
d  dl  = - 4  (1- (1+)^2 Q  ) 
   (1-)^2  . 
This is readily integrated:
l-l_0 = 4   
 + 

,
where  is a constant.  Note that there are no singularities 
at the location of the original poles of the beta function. 


As described in , the RG flows possess a number of phases 
depending on the value of .  For the flows with UV or IR fixed points
the perturbing operators away from the fixed point are scaling fields,
i.e. their scaling dimension is constant along the flow.  Thus
for the flows with fixed points, the RG invariant  encodes 
these scaling dimensions.  The flows with fixed points all correspond
to  and are reviewed in more detail in the next section. 

The cyclic flows on the other hand correspond to .  Here, since
there are no UV or IR fixed points,  does not encode anomalous
dimensions, but rather the only universal feature of the flow,
namely the period of the cycles, which we now calculate.   
The coupling  flows toward , where it jumps to 
 and eventually returns to its initial value.  One
can see explicitly this jump from the solution as follows. Parameterizing
 as in eq. (), 
for  large, and , the solution 
is 
- 4     .  
Thus when  the coupling jumps from 
 to .  

As before, 
define  as the period in  for one cycle, eq. (). 
Evidently
 where  are
the RG times when .  From the exact solution
eq. (), and 
 the fact that ,  
 one finds the simple result
= 2   . 
Note that this is twice the 1-loop result. 

The RG results presented so far also give an indication
of the mass gaps of this theory. Indeed from eq. ()
we see that when  the coupling 
becomes  , which implies a mass gap 
 associated to the
length scale  (we are assuming for simplicity
 and ). This mass is usually associated
to the existence of two bound states, the soliton and
antisoliton, in the application of  this model to the 
XXZ spin chain  
in the antiferromagnetic regime (see section V). 
As we showed above the RG flow to the IR can be made cyclic if
we allow  to jump from 
to  and continue running with the RG. 
After an RG time  the coupling 
becomes again  and hence we expect
another mass gap 
at a length scale  . Repeating
this process through  cycles the corresponding mass
gap will be 
,   
associated to a length scale that we identify with 
the actual size of the system, namely  
. In this manner the cyclic RG 
flow generates a hierarchy of masses ,
among which the lowest one, , is the natural candidate 
for the fundamental particles of the model. 
Later we shall show that these
particles are solitons and antisolitons. The novelty of the
cyclic RG is that it predicts the existence of a hierarchy
of high energy particles which, as  we shall show
in section IV, can be thought of as resonances of the 
fundamentals ones. 

An alternative interpretation
of these results is obtained by running the RG to the
UV instead to the IR. Clearly this running is what
produces the high energy masses which one usually 
does not observe in the standard application of the field
theory model to spin systems, which possesses a natural
short distance cut-off. In this sense the cyclic
RG represents a modification of 
the short distance Physics of the usual spin systems.

Bosonization 

The level-1  current algebra can be bosonized as follows:
J^= 2   e^ i 2    , J_3 = i 2   _z ,
where  is the -dependent part of a free massless
scalar field .  Viewing
the  coupling as a perturbation of the kinetic energy term
and rescaling the field  one obtains the action
S = 4  d^2 x 
,
where to lowest order . 
The field  is normalized such that when , 
 
and the scaling dimension of  is . 
(The coupling  is related to the conventional sine-Gordon
coupling  as  so that the 
free fermion point corresponds to .)   It was shown
that the all-orders beta-function eq. () is consistent
with the known two-loop beta-function of the sine-Gordon theory
in .  
  

Q  

For the flows with fixed points, i.e. , 
the coupling  can be related to
 by properly matching the slope of the beta function at
the fixed points where .  The result is^2 = 2 1+2Q    
Q   = 2^2 2 - ^2 .
The region  is the massive sine-Gordon phase
with .  If , i.e. ,  
the spectrum contains bound states of the 
solitons and antisolitons called breathers,
which are absent if  , i.e.  . 
When , , and  is
purely imaginary, this corresponds  to the massive sinh-Gordon theory.
Finally when , the perturbation is irrelevant
since  and this corresponds to the massless regime
with an IR fixed point. All these regions are plotted
in figure 2.   




 
Description of the different regimes of the
sine-Gordon model as a function of .   


Parameterizing  as in eq. (), and making
an analytic extension of eq. (), we see that 
the cyclic regime corresponds to 
^2  = 2  1 + i /2  = 
4 (4 + ^2 )^1/2   e^ -i ^-1  (/2 )  .
Since  has both real and imaginary parts, this theory is neither
the sine-Gordon nor the sinh-Gordon theories. In this bosonized
description the hamiltonian does not appear to be hermitian 
however this is an artifact of the bosonized description since in
the current algebra description the action is real.  To lowest order,
the  origin
of the imaginary part of  is the square-root in the rescaling
of the field involved in
going from eq. () to eq. ().  Furthermore
the spin-chain realization in section V also has a hermitian hamiltonian. 

We will use some properties of the bosonized description to put forward
a conjecture concerning the spectrum and S-matrices.  
  The sine-Gordon theory is known to possess the 
 quantum affine 
symmetry which commutes with the hamiltonian
and the S-matrix , where 
q = e^2i / ^2   = - e^2i  .
The construction in  is valid regardless of value
of . 
For the cyclic regime, though  has real and imaginary parts, 
 is real:
q = - e^ - /2  .
We point out that
the sine-Gordon theory is also known to possess another, dual, quantum
group structure 
which  encodes the commutation relations of
the monodromy matrix .
The dual quantum group is the algebraic structure underlying the
Bethe ansatz in the quantum inverse scattering method. 
The latter is closely tied to the hamiltonian itself, since the
trace of the monodromy matrix yields the integrals of motion.
Generally, if  then the dual is . 
Let us flip the sign of , which in the field theory is
nothing more than a Klein transformation modifying the statistics
of the soliton fields.   Then 
the dual- is precisely the inverse of the finite RG transformation of one
cycle:  . 
Though this is an intriguing observation,  we will make no further use
of it in this paper.  


 




Spectrum and S-matrices 

In this section we propose a particle spectrum and S-matrices for
the cyclic regime.  Based on the bosonized description of section III,
if the theory contains solitons of topological charge , then
the S-matrix of these solitons should simply be the usual sine-Gordon
soliton S-matrix with the particular value of  given in
eq. ().  One argument is based on the known 
 symmetry of the bosonic theory, since
it was shown in  that the S-matrix is fixed up to 
an overall scalar factor by requiring it to commute with
this symmetry.  The form of  in eq. () is rather special
in that it leads to the real value of  in eq. (); 
a more general complex  would imply a complex .  

Another argument relies directly on the XXZ spin chain.  The latter is
known to have massive spinon excitations whose S-matrix on the lattice
was found in .  In the next section we take a certain 
continuum limit
of this spinon S-matrix and  obtain the sine-Gordon
soliton S-matrix at the value of  in eq. ().  
Finally we point out that the limit  is the isotropic limit
of the spin chain which is known to have a spinon spectrum, and this
supports the idea that the spectrum contains solitons/spinons.  
 
 
 2   .
 


The cyclic S-matrix 

We now describe the soliton S-matrix in detail, and in a way 
that makes the above statements more transparent.  Let 
denote the usual rapidity that parameterizes the energy and momentum
of the soliton:
E = M_s ,       p = M_s .
Let  denote the creation operators for the solitons,
where  denotes the topological charge.  The S-matrix
may be viewed as encoding the exchange relation of these operators:
A_a (_1 ) A_b (_2) = S_ab ^cd  (_1 -_2 )   
A_d (_2 ) A_c (_1 ) .
Extending the formulas in  to the regime () one
obtains the S-matrix
S () =




 
= - () 2i  




,
where 
q = - e^-/2   ,        = e^-i/ 2 .
(.) 
The S-matrix must satisfy crossing-symmetry and unitarity which read
S_ab ^cd  () = S_bc  ^da   (i- ) 
,        S() S(-) = 1.
The above equations lead to the following constraints on the overall
scalar factor :
() (-) =
1  (- z)   (+ z) 
,       () = (i-),
where we have defined
= i 2  ,      z = -i    = 
 2 .
The minimal solution, i.e. the solution with the minimal number
of singularities is () = -     
  
_n=1 ^
 F_n () F_n (i- ) F_n (0) F_n (i)  , 
with 
F_n () =     
   . 
The standard S-matrix for the massive sine-Gordon model
is given by the same formulas (,,)
with the following substitutions:
= 8   , 
z = - 8 i   , q= - e^8 ^2 i / , = e^- 8 / ,
where  is related to  by the equation
 8   = b^2 2 - b^2  = 1 2 Q  
,Q  > 0.
Hence the relationship between the massive sine-Gordon S-matrix
and the cyclic S-matrix amounts simply to the analytic
continuation


- 16 i  .
The analytic extension eq. () is reminiscent of
the staircase models, however
there are some important differences.  The staircase model
corresponds to .
In terms of , it corresponds to 
.  For small , 
this is a deformation of , which is in the sinh-Gordon
regime.  The S-matrix is thus an analytic extension of the
sinh -Gordon S-matrix, with a single resonance, 
 whereas ours is a deformation of
the sine-Gordon one.   Furthermore, for the staircase model,
the c-function, though it roams, monotomically decreases.
For the cyclic sine-Gordon model we expect a cyclic behavior
of the c-function because of the cyclic RG (see the conclusions). 
 

Resonances 

The spinon S-matrix has numerous poles which can be interpreted
as resonances.  This is the reason it does not satisfy
real analyticity .   More generally,  consider a pole at
 with ,  in the S-matrix 
for the scattering of two particles of masses , . As
discussed in  this corresponds to a resonance
of mass  and inverse lifetime  where
^2 = m_1^2 + m_2^2 + 2m_1 m_2 (-i). 
Equivalently:
M^2 - ^2 4  &=& m_1^2 + m_2^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 ,

 
M&=&  2 m_1 m_2 .
The spinon S-matrix has an infinite number of 
poles at 
and  with  a positive
integer. The poles at  yield a real mass and correspond
to resonances with
an infinitely long lifetime , 
while the poles at 
 yield an imaginary mass and are not physical
(see table 1). 
It is interesting to compare this situation to what happens
for the usual massive
regime of the sine-Gordon theory where . In this
case, when ,
the poles at   lead
to the breather bound states, while those at 
 are these same poles in the crossed
channel. 



 
  



Table 1.- 
Poles and masses of the cyclic and the massive
sine-Gordon models.



Since the poles  are right on the cut in the -plane
(),   
it is desirable  to incorporate a small imaginary part  taking
them off the cut and giving the particles a large finite lifetime.
This can be viewed as a kind of "" prescription as follows.
Letting
+ i ,
with  very small,  
the poles are now at 
_n 2n   - i _n ,       
_n 2n  ^2 . 
The prescription eq. () does not spoil crossing-symmetry,
unitarity, nor the Yang-Baxter equation. 
As , from eq. () 
the mass  and width  of the 
n-th resonance is 
m_n 2 M_s n   ,       
_n  4n ^2  M_s n  . 
Each resonance of mass , , actually corresponds
to four particles transforming in the direct sum of the q-deformed
spin 1 and singlet representations. One can easily
see this by noting that the entries 
and their charge conjugates  are non-zero at the poles ,
while   and   are zero. 
If the fundamental solitons have
topological charge , then each resonance is a triplet 
with topological charges  or a singlet with
topological charge . 
This is in contrast to the
usual breather bound state poles at  which occur
in the scattering channel of a soliton with an anti-soliton and are
thus singlets.   
( and  are zero  at the pole ).



In the language of the fusion procedure , which
is equivalent to the bootstrap,   the poles 
 project onto the singlet whereas  
projects onto the (-deformed)  
spin-1 and spin-0 representations. 
This can be seen explicitly by going to the so-called homogeneous
gradation.  
The soliton S-matrix can be expressed as
S (, q) = -  2i   
_21   R   _12 ^-1   P ,
where 
, 
,
with  the topological charge and 
 the permutation operator:
P= 



.
The matrix  can then be expressed in terms of
the projectors  and   onto the q-deformed spin 
and spin  representations:
R  () = 
(q - ^-1  q^-1  )P_1 + (^-1  q - q^-1  ) P_0, 
where 
P_0 = 1+q^2   



,
and .   
The usual sine-Gordon breather poles at  correspond 
to  and one sees that at this
,  , showing that the breathers
are indeed singlets.  A pole at  projects onto the
irreducible spin 1 representation.  However our resonance poles
at  correspond to  where
.   
The resonances, as the sine-Gordon breathers , also carry a
C-parity given by  for the triplets and 
for the singlets.    










  


     

The above spectrum of masses has scaling properties that are
consistent with a cyclic RG.  As argued in section III 
the spinon mass   must be proportional
to , where  is the system size.  
In the limit  or ,
eq. () becomes, 
m_n(L) 1 L   e^n / , 
n/ ,
which exhibits the Russian doll scaling property
 m_n(e^-   L ) m_n+2  (L),

similar to what was found in .  Thus the way the spectrum
reproduces itself after one RG cycle is that  at a given
length  plays the same role as  
at the longer length  (see figure 3). Notice 
that the jump by two in  is consistent with the parity
of the resonances. 
Eq. () also shows that after one RG cycle
two new low energy masses appear in the spectrum.
This gain of the
lowest energy states in the spectrum is what allows
for the reshuffling of resonances
after one cycle and seems to be an essential ingredient
of any cyclic RG.

of the system.  denotes the maximal size of
the system. The Russian doll scaling of eq. ()
is described by the dotted lines. 
  



In a finite size system we expect to have a finite number
of resonances,  ,  which can be estimated as follows.
If in   every RG cycle we get two more resonances, then 
after  cycles with ,
we expect to have  resonances,
with 
n_res     L a . 
This kind of equation was checked numerically for the Russian
Doll BCS model.  




Closing the bootstrap: stringy spectrum 

In the limit that the regulator  goes to zero, the resonances
are stable particles and can exist as asymptotic states. 
Thus, one should attempt to  close the bootstrap including
the resonances in asymptotic states as proposed in . 
Since the bootstrap is equivalent to the fusion construction 
in the theory of quantum affine algebras,  it is clear for example
that the resulting S-matrix for the scattering of the soliton 
with the triplets of resonances should be solution of the
Yang-Baxter equation corresponding to  the universal -matrix
of  evaluated in the representations 
 where  is the  dimensional
-deformed spin- representation.


S^(n)  
1/2  

Continuing to close the bootstrap leads to resonances in the
q-deformed spin  representation  with . 
To simplify matters we will only consider the scattering of the particle
in   of maximal topological charge .  This avoids the 
complexities of non-diagonal scattering and will be sufficient 
to obtain a mass formula as a function of . 

Let  denote the diagonal scattering of the
-th spin  particle of topological charge  with the 
soliton of topological charge .  For ,  refers to the
quantum number in eq. (), and  when , there
is no -dependence and .
If the particle of charge  appears as a resonance
in the scattering of spin  with spin  particles, then the
S-matrix has a simple pole:
_, j  () - _,j ^j+1/2   ,
and the masses are related by the formula
m_c^2 = m_a^2 + m_b^2 + 2 m_a m_b _ab ^c, 
with .   The above equation implies 
the following relation
between the fusion angles:
_ab ^c + _bc ^a + _ac ^b = 2i.
In the equations (,) all the masses are implicitly 
at the same fixed .   


  

Given  one can construct the S-matrix
 from the bootstrap procedure:
_, j+  () = 
_, j   
 S_,  
, 
where . 

Let us first consider the scattering of the spin  solitons with the spin
 resonances discussed above.  We already found that
 and eq. () 
implies .  The bootstrap
equation then reads 
_, 1  () = S_,  
 S_,  .
The factor  only has real  poles
at  
and zeros at  where .   Remarkably
this leads to the fact that the only real pole of  is
at .  
The other poles of  either lead to double poles
or are canceled by the zeros in the other  factor.  

Let  denote the mass of the n-th resonance with spin .  
The above value of  leads to 
m^2_n (j=3/2) = 4M_s^2 . 
Moving on to the spin  resonances, one finds that the fusion angles
are somewhat more complicated.   Since the masses  are
already determined for , the relevant fusion angles
follow from eq. () and one obtains

_1/2,1 ^3/2  &=& n  ,

 
_1/2,3/2 ^1 &=&  2 + h 2 + h^-1   , 
he^2 n/ ,


_1,3/2 ^1/2   &=&  (1+h)(2+h^-1 ) 
(1+h^-1 )(2 + h)  .





The S-matrix is 
_1/2,3/2  () = 
_1/2,1  S_1/2,1/2 .
Similarly to the  case, the above S-matrix has a 
single  simple pole at  where
_1/2,3/2 ^2 = n   - _1,3/2 ^1/2 . 
This leads to the mass 
m_n^2 (j=2) = 4 M_s^2 . 
Having understood the above cases we can readily extend the results to
arbitrary .  Examining the poles in the S-matrix  one
finds a single, real, simple pole at 
_1/2,j ^j+1/2  = _1/2,j-1/2 ^j - _j-1/2,j ^1/2 .
This leads to the mass formula
m^2_n (j) &= & 4 M_s^2  


& =& M_s^2  ( 2 j -1 + h)(2 j -1 + h^-1 ).
 From this mass formula one can determine all the fusion angles:
_1/2,j ^j+1/2  &=&
 2 j -1 + h 2 j -1 + h^-1   ,

 
_1/2,j+1/2 ^j &=&
 2 j  + h 2 j  + h^-1   ,


_j,j+1/2 ^1/2  &=&
 (2j-1 + h) (2 j  + h^-1 ) 
(2 j -1  + h^-1 )(2 j + h)  .
The above mass spectrum is suggestive of a string theory. 
We remark that the higher spin particles that make up the
Regge trajectory of the bosonic string also appear 
as resonances on the physical cut in the Veneziano 
amplitude .   Consider
the "leading Regge trajectory", i.e. the lowest mass at spin . 
When  is very small,  the formula () becomes
m^2 (j) (j - (0) ),
where the Regge slope and intercept are 
= 2 M_s^2 e^2/  ,       (0) = 1/2.
(The leading Regge trajectory corresponds to .) 
The usual field theory limit in string theory is 
which  corresponds to , where all the resonances become
infinitely massive. The fact that our theory has two
coupling constants, namely  and , also
suggests that the underlying string has another parameter
such as a compactification radius.  
If there is indeed an underlying string description,  much remains
to be understood regarding the nature of this string theory.  

Jumping the  barrier? 

We close this section with some speculative remarks 
regarding the possible nature of the string theory, if there
is indeed such a description.   
Consider a non-critical bosonic string theory in  spacetime
dimensions,  where  is the
Virasoro central charge of the matter content with .  
Because , there are some Liouville degrees of freedom
with central charge ,  where .   The Liouville
theory has the action
S_Liouville  = 
d^2 x 4  
. 
The central charge of the Liouville theory is related to  as
follows:
c_L = 1 + 6 ^2.  
The full range  beyond the "" barrier, 
corresponds to 
b^2 = 2 e^i ,      with       = 
c_m - 13 12 
Note that in the range we are considering, . 
Like the sine-Gordon theory,  the Liouville theory has a finite
 quantum group symmetry with  the same as in 
eq. () . 


To relate our S-matrix theory to the string theory we would
need to relate the Polyakov path integral over Riemann surfaces
(summed over genus) 
for the matter coupled to 2d gravity, and it isn't at all clear
how to even begin to do this.  We point out however that this
has been done for the  case leading to an exact 2D S-matrix
.  (For a review, see.)
Here we merely examine the following. 
The  interaction of the Liouville theory 
is one part of the  interaction of the sine-Gordon theory,
and we expect that the Liouville theory for  given
in eq. () shares some common features with the
sine-Gordon theory at the same . 

For , and  small, eq. () 
matches eq. () and thus corresponds to our cyclic
sine-Gordon model.  One sees that this is just below the 
 barrier:
c_m 25 - 3 2  ^2 
Interestingly, when  with 
 small,  is just above 1, 
,  and this corresponds to 
the deformation of the sinh -Gordon theory which is
the staircase model.   
It would be very interesting if the idea of a Russian doll
RG plays a role in resolving the known long-standing difficulties
in going beyond .   

















Realization in the XXZ Heisenberg Chain  


In this section we give further support of our conjecture
by taking a particular continuum limit of the XXZ spin chain. 
It is well-known that in the continuum limit the spin  
Heisenberg chain  is well described
by the  anisotropic current-current perturbation of  section II.
(See for instance .)
In this section we relate  the spin chain parameters to  the couplings
,  in order to determine what regime of the spin chain 
corresponds to the cyclic regime of the KT flows. 



The spin  chain has the hamiltonian 
 
H = - J
  _i=1 ^N 
.
Let us first relate  to the couplings ,  in the critical
(massless) regime, .   In the current-current RG
description,  here the flows terminate in the IR along the critical
line  with . In this regime, 
.  The spin-chain may be mapped onto a theory of
fermions via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. 
   Bosonizing these  Jordan-Wigner fermions, one
obtains the sine-Gordon theory.  
(See for instance .)  
In this  bosonized description, 
the flows arrive at the fixed point via the irrelevant 
operator  with scaling dimension .
The parameter  is known
from the Bethe ansatz to be related to  as follows:
.  In terms of :
 = - 2.
Let us turn now to the cyclic 
regime,  where .  Let us assume that the formula ()
is valid in this regime also.  Although  is imaginary,
  is still real. 
Parameterizing  as in eq. (), , one finds 
= - 2 . 
 From eq. () one sees that the cyclic regime of the RG corresponds
to the antiferromagnetic domain  in the spin chain.
   In terms of ,  the period 
of the RG flows is given in eq. (), namely
. 


There is one additional check of the above series of mappings. 
The spin chain is known to directly possess the 
symmetry on the lattice , where  is related to 
 as follows:  
= 2  (q + q^-1  ). 
Observe that the above equation is consistent with eqs. ()
and ().

The XXZ spin chain with  was studied inusing the underlying  symmetry on the lattice. 
One feature of this algebraic approach is the construction of
so-called type II vertex operators , , which
can be interpreted as creation operators for the fundamental
spinons.  These operators satisfy the exchange relation
Z_a (_1 ) Z_b (_2 ) = R_ab ^cd  (_1 / _2 )  
Z_d (_2 ) Z_c (_1 ).
(Compare with eq. ()). 
The matrix  in the above equation can be interpreted as
the S-matrix for the spinons on the lattice.  An S-matrix for
this regime of the spin chain was also obtained from the Bethe
ansatz in .  The explicit form
of  is precisely as in eq. () where now  parametrizes
 as in eq. () and is thus the same as in eq. ().  
The expression for  on the lattice is
_xxz  () = 
-2i ^-1  (q- q^-1 ^-1 )  
(q^4 ^-2  ; q^4 )_(q^2 ^2 ; q^4 )_  
(q^4 ^2 ; q^4 )_(q^2 ^-2  ; q^4 )_ ,
where
(y; x)__n=0 ^(1- yx^n ).
The infinite product form for overall factor  satisfies
unitarity and crossing-symmetry in the form:
_xxz  () _xxz  (^-1  ) = 
-4q^2 (1-^2 q^2 ) (1-^-2  q^2 )  ,      
_xxz  () = _xxz  (-q  )
which is equivalent to eq. (). 

On the lattice,  the particles have energies expressed in terms of
elliptic functions.  Letting
= -i e^i  , 
then in terms of  the energy and momentum are 
E() = 2K   K' K  
 , 
     
p() =  - 2 .
(See  for definitions.)  In the above formulas the nome
of the elliptic functions is 
 which
is between  and .  

The particular continuum limit that leads to the S-matrix in section 
IV involves taking the momentum and also  to be small. 
Let us first take the momentum to be small.  From the definition of
, one finds that .  Letting
, from the definition of  
one has 
K + 2K    = _0^p + /2   
d  1-k^2 ^2   ,
which can be transformed to 
2K    = _0^p   
d k'^2 + k^2 ^2   .
Above, ,  are the standard moduli of the elliptic functions. 
When  is small,  can be approximated by  and one
finds
p = k' k   .   
We now let  approach one, i.e.  small but not zero. 
Using known expressions in terms of the dual nome
, which goes to zero in the 
limit , one has 
 
K     ,
K'  2  ,   
k 1-8 q ,       k'4 q  .
Thus in this limit one finds
p - k' , 
where the rapidity  is identified as
= - 2   .
Turning to the energy, we need the identity
(u ) =  1- k^2 ^2 ((u))  .
Using the limits eq. () one finds 
E = k' .
Thus the spinon velocity is  and the mass goes with 

. The latter result agrees with the RG estimate
of the mass gap  made
in section II. Identifying the rapidity   from eq. () one
finds that the spectral parameter ,
which agrees with eq. (). 

 The 
 overall factors  and  however are not the same
even though they both satisfy the crossing and unitarity constraint
eq. ()(An erroneous statement was made to the
contrary in.) .    
The infinite product can be rearranged and expressed as:
_xxz  =  (-z)  
_n=1 ^ ((2-2n)- z) ((2n-1)-z )  
((2n-2)- z) ((1-2n)-z )  
where  are defined in eq. ( ). 
Using , this can
be expressed as
_xxz  =   (-z)(1-+ z) 
_n=1 ^( (2n-2)-z ) ( (2-2n)+ z+1) 
( (1-2n)-z ) ( (2n-1)+ z+1 )  
( (2-2n)-z ) ( (2n-2)+ z+1)
( (2n-1)-z ) ( (1-2n)+ z + 1 ) 
Comparing with eq. (), one sees that  
has more singularities than , as it must since 
 is the minimal solution to crossing and unitarity.
Thus  and  differ by CDD factors.
In fact,  is analytic in the range
, while
 is not.  Furthermore the poles in  
at  which give rise to the resonances
are absent in , and are thus no accessible directly
on the lattice.   
The argument that  rather than  is
the proper overall factor is that the cyclic RG flow is
a property of the continuum theory with a current-current
or sine-Gordon description and  is based on this continuum
theory. 
 In any 
case the poles at , with  a positive integer,
which give rise to the resonances, occur in both  
and .  





 
We emphasize that in taking the  particular continuum limit described
above, 
we  have implicitly provided an ultra-violet completion 
of  the XXZ spin chain which goes beyond the lattice model, 
 possibly turning it
into a string theory at short distances. 

 























   

Comparison between the cyclic sine-Gordon model
and Russian doll BCS model 


It is interesting to make a comparison between
the cyclic sine-Gordon model we have studied
in the previous sections and the Russian
doll BCS model introduced in reference , 
which also possesses a cyclic RG. 
The model considered in the latter reference
is a simple modification of the reduced
BCS model used in the study of the superconducting properties
of ultrasmall metallic grains. It describes the pairing
interactions between  pairs of electrons occupying 
energy levels , which are separated by an 
energy distance , i.e. 
. The model is characterized by 
a scattering potential
 equal to  for 
 and 
   for 

in units of the energy spacing . 

The case  is equivalent to the 
usual BCS model which has a unique
condensate with a superconducting gap
given by 
for  sufficiently small. When 
 is non zero the BCS gap equation
has an infinite number of solutions
corresponding to condensates with
gaps 
, where  depends
on  and . This model can also 
be studied using a renormalization group
which reduces the number of energy levels
, namely , 
by integrating out the high energy modes.  
The RG leaves invariant 
the coupling constant 
, while  runs with an equation
similar to the one loop result () and has a cyclic
behavior with a period ,
which in turn is related to the cyclicity
of the gaps 
.
Notice that in this case,  
as compared to eq. (),
the jump in  is one,  
due to the fact that 
there is no discrete symmetry
associated to .
In a finite system the number of the 
condensates  is given 
by , 
in close resemblance to eq. (). 
All these results together with the
corresponding ones for the cyclic sine-Gordon
model are summarized in table 2.

Conclusions 

In this paper we have analyzed in detail
the cyclic regime of the Kosterlitz-Thouless flows
of a current-current perturbation of the
 level  WZW model . 
We have computed the RG time  of a complete
cycle in terms of the RG invariant  of the non perturbative
RG equations , obtaining . 
Using standard bosonization techniques we have
mapped the perturbed WZW model into the sine-Gordon
model parametrized by a complex coupling 
. The latter model 
possesses a quantum affine algebra
 with a real  
quantum deformation parameter ,
together with a dual quantum
group structure 
with .
Assuming the existence of solitons with
topological charge  with 
a factorized scattering S-matrix commuting with the 

 symmetry, we
have conjectured a spectrum and S-matrix for the cyclic
regime of the Kosterlitz-Thouless flows. This 
S-matrix is an analytic extension of the
massive sine-Gordon S-matrix.  
The cyclic S-matrix has
poles leading to an infinite number of resonances with the Russian
doll scaling behavior consistent with a cyclic RG flow.  

Remarkably we found that closure of the S-matrix bootstrap
leads to resonances of arbitrarily higher spin with a string-like
mass formula.  This will be elaborated upon in another 
publication .  As discussed in section IV, 
it would be very interesting if the idea of a cyclic RG could
shed new light on the problem of the  barrier.  

A few remarks concerning the so-called c-theorem are warranted. 
The c-theorem is a statement regarding the irreversibility of
the RG flow: as the scale is increased massive states decouple
and  decreases monotonically .  The c-function 
may be viewed as a function of the scale-dependent couplings,
.   Thus, a cyclic RG would appear to give rise
to a periodic c-function, violating the c-theorem.  
How can this happen in a theory as well-known  as the KT flows? 
One answer is  that Zamolodchikov's proof of the c-theorem assumes
that one can define the theory as a perturbation about a UV fixed
point.  But a cyclic RG by definition has no such fixed point
so the very assumptions of the theorem fail.   It would be
very interesting to perform a thermodynamic Bethe ansatz analysis
based on the S-matrix we have proposed to study the behavior of 
the c-function . 


This work further supports the idea that cyclic RG behavior may be
more commonplace than originally anticipated, and may possibly
represent a new paradigm for Physics. It is tempting, though probably
foolhardy,  to  even speculate
that the generations of fermions in the standard model 
are just the first few in an infinite sequence of Russian
dolls.
