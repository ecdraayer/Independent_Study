It is shown that the four-particle amplitude of superstring theory
at two loops obtained in is equivalent to
the previously obtained results in
. Here the  symmetry in hyperelliptic Riemann
surface plays an important role in the proof.




In some previous papers we have
computed explicitly the two loop -particle amplitude in
superstring theory for all  by using the newly obtained
measure of D'Hoker and Phong
 (for a recent review see
). The new measure of D'Hoker and
Phong is unambiguous and slice-independent. For all  we
proved that the -particle amplitudes are identically zero. A
simple expression was also obtained for the 4-particle amplitude
which is independent of the insertion points of the supermoduli.
Our explicit results beautifully verifies the result of D'Hoker
and Phong, especially for the non-zero four-particle amplitude.

A natural question is the relation with the previously obtained
result in which had been proved
to satisfy all the conditions for a qualified 4-particle
amplitude. In particular, the explicit result has also been used
by Iengo to prove the vanishing of the 2-loop
correction to the  term, in agreement with
the indirect argument of Green and Gutperle,
Green, Gutperle and Vanhove, and Green and Sethi
 that the  term does not receive
perturbative contributions beyond one loop. Recently, Stieberger
and Taylor  also used the result of
 to prove the vanishing of the
heterotic two-loop  term. For some closely related works we
refer the reader to the reviews.

In this paper we will show that the explicit results obtained by
using different chiral measure are actually equivalent. This
should be the case because they are all derived from first
principle. In the proof we used the  symmetry of the
conformal field theory on hyperelliptic Riemann surface.

Our starting point is the chiral integrand obtained in
:
 
As we said in, we need to symmetrize in 
to obtain an explicitly  independent result. This
symmetrization is justified as follows. First we have
 
where  is the stress
energy tensor. In the above, the last  term gives an 
independent result (see) and the first  term will
give an vanishing contribution to the amplitude after integration
over  as we can prove as follows.

By the  symmetry of the conformal field theory on
hyperelliptic Riemann surface(See
 for works on conformal field
theory on  Riemann surface.)  we have
 
where  is the  transformed point of , i.e.,
 and  are the two identical points on the two
different sheets of the hyperelliptic Riemann surface. By using
this result,  we have
 
In the above we have used the  invariance of the
integration measure  and in the last step we have
changed the dummy integration variables 's back into
's. We note that in the above proof we have symbolically
denoted the contribution of the right part as 
. For specific amplitudes the above reasoning can be
justified completely. So effectively we can set 
in the chiral integrand, as we have used in. The
chiral integrand is then given as follows:
 

Now we recall the result obtained in
 for the 4-particle chiral amplitude. We have
 
where
 
is the contribution from the ghost supercurrent. In the above
expression the 's are the three ghost insertion points and
should be set to  if we choose  as the three
moduli to be integrated.

By using the result of, we found that the
contribution to the chiral integrand from 
 is given as follows:
 
The expressions that we will need are given as follows:
 
(See for details and notations.)  By
direct comparison we found the following equality:
 
if we identify , the three ghost insertion points. We
note the important "" sign in front of . This
shows clearly that  is not the complete
expression for the chiral integrand.

To prove that  and  give identical
scattering amplitude, we first note the following:
 
by using the following explicit expression for the 
 correlator:
 
where
 
From eq. (), we see that the second term will give half
of the result of  when we substitute it into
. It remains to compute the rest terms in
. We denote it as  and it is given as
follows:
 
As we proved in, the above
expression is independent of  after integration over all
moduli. To simplify the computation we can make a convenient
choice for the insertion points  or .  We will take
the limit . In this limit we have
 
We will prove that the second term vanishes and the first term
gives the other half of . We note that this is the case
only after we make this special choice for .

First we start with the second term. By using the result of
, we can change the integration over the moduli
 and  into  and 
by fixing . The chiral integrand doesn't change and it
is still given by the following expression:
 
The important point is the following: the rest part of the
integrand is invariant under modular transformation, i.e.,
symmetric under . (We note that 
.) On the other hand,  is antisymmetric under
the following modular transformation:
 
So after integration over all 's,  gives a
vanishing result. This result can also be understood from another
point of view. Because of modular invariance, each term in the
summation in  gives the same result after
integration over all 's and all of them add to zero.

The other term in () is:
 
In order to compute it explicitly, we first note the result of
 proved before. Explicitly we have(All
equality, such as ,  should be understood as
expressions inserted in the complete amplitude and integration
over all moduli is implicit.) :
 
by using the explicit result for the 
 correlator given in (). If we set 
, we have
 
Substituting this result into eq. (), we have
 
This proves
