Abstract 
 
We compute the two-body one-loop effective action for the matrix
theory in the pp-wave background, and compare it to the effective
action on the supergravity side in the same background. Agreement is
found for the effective actions on both sides. This points to the
existence of a supersymmetric nonrenormalization theorem in the
pp-wave background.

Introduction 

The Matrix model of M-theory proposed by   is
believed to give a  non-perturbative description of quantum
gravity. In the original paper  ,  the authors computed
graviton scattering in flat space using the Matrix model and  found
exact agreement with 11-dimensional Supergravity, which is believed to
be the  low energy limit of M-theory. The result also suggested the
existence of a  nonrenormalization theorem for the  term in the
effective action, which was  subsequently confirmed by the study of
supersymmetry in  . Since
then, more detailed investigations have been performed in  flat space
 .  The Matrix
model in a weakly curved background was proposed by Taylor and Van
Raamsdonk in   . The case of a space weakly curved in the
transverse directions was checked explicitly in   .

The Matrix Theory action in the pp-wave background was proposed in
 . Since this  new action is exact in this curved
background, it could provide further tests of the  Matrix conjecture
beyond the proposal on weakly curved backgrounds in  . In
addtion  it is different from the case in  , because the
background  metric now has a nontrivial  component.

The goal of this paper is to compare two-graviton scattering in the
pp-wave background  in Matrix Theory and Supergravity. An agreement
will provide evidence for: (1) the existence of a supersymmetric
nonrenormalization theorem in pp-wave background for the terms
compared; (2) Matrix model as a description of M-theory in the pp-wave
background. As pointed out by, Matrix Theory in a
generic curved background is not expected to agree with
Supergravity. In the pp-wave case, however, we do find precise
agreement as will be shown in this paper. This is likely to be a
result of the large number of supersymmetries of the pp-wave
background.







































The paper is organized as follows. In Section , we briefly
review the  previously known results in flat space and in weakly
curved backgrounds. In Section  , the approximations and
limits of our computation are discussed. In  Section  through
Section , we present the computation on the  Matrix
Theory side. In Section  we present the computation on
the  Supergravity side. In Section  we discuss
some possible future  directions. Some of the technical details are
given in the Appendices.

A Brief Review of Known Results 
In, the one-loop effective potential for two gravitons in
flat spacetime  background was computed in Matrix Theory to be:
 
where  and  are the numbers of D0-branes making up the probe
graviton and source graviton, respectively,  and  are the
transverse relative velocity and distance between them,   is the
11-dimensional Planck mass, and  is the radius of compactification
in  DLCQ. This effective potential agrees precisely with the
Supergravity result .

In, the effective potential for a weakly curved background
with nontrivial  transverse metric components was computed. Again
agreement was found. In fact, the  only modification needed was the
replacement of  by , the geodesic distance  between the two
gravitons.

The Effective Potential,  
In this paper, the main object for comparison on both sides is the
effective potential  . The computation is carried out in the
DLCQ formalism, which was proposed in  Susskind's finite N conjecture
, and further elucidated by
. In this formalism  and   are
identified.  is therefore quantized in units of .

The implications of such a lightlike compactification, however, are
far from trivial. One such complication arises from the
longitudinal zero modes, which appear to cause perturbative amplitudes
to diverge. In addition, there are concerns that the DLCQ of M-theory
in the low energy limit is not necessarily the DLCQ of 11-dimensional
Supergravity because some exotic degrees of freedom such as membranes
wrapped around the lightlike direction may contribute.

Here we are going to take the viewpoint in. Essentially,
the presence of a source exerts a pressure that decompactifies the
region surrounding it, rendering  effectively spacelike by
providing a nonzero  component in the metric.  In the limit of
large N, this bubble of 11-dimensional space expands, and the
approximation of Supergravity as a low energy description is thus
justified. This view is further elucidated in, and we do
not expect new issues to arise in the pp-wave background.

It was also argued in that the perturbative calculations
in Matrix Theory and Supergravity have different regions of validity
( and ). Therefore, in general there is no
reasons why they should match as each effective action is valid only
within its own energy scale.  Thus a mismatch does not immediately
invalidate the Matrix Conjecture. An exact match, however, will point
to the existence of a nonrenormalization theorem, which protects the
terms evaluated from gaining higher loops corrections. If such a
nonrenormalization theorem does exist, then the agreement of both
sides can be viewed as positive evidence for the Matrix Conjecture. It
is with these points in mind that the comparison of the effective
action is made here.

On the Matrix Theory side, the effective potential is computed up to
1-loop. As in flat space, it should correspond to to terms of order
 on the Supergravity side.  The relation
 means only terms of order
 are relevant on the Matrix Theory side for the purpose of such
comparison.

A natural length scale that arises on the Matrix Theory side is
, which for convenience we will denote as
.
(This  should not be confused with the string scale
.)  In addition to the low velocity and large 
approximation necessary to facilitate comparison in flat space, we
will assume also:

 
where  is the  component of the four-form field strength.

This dimensionless number, as we will see in eqn(), is
simply the relative strength of the new terms in the action arising
from the pp-wave background to the quartic terms already present in
flat space. In the opposite limit, ,
the effective potential on the Matrix Theory side resums to give 
 dependence(This can be seen in eqn(), a typical
term in the effective potential.) , which does not appear possible to
be reproduced on the Supergravity side. In fact, this is nothing
new. A similar issue arises already in flat space, where the effective
potential only matches when we take the small  and large  limit,
or more precisely, by expanding on the small parameter 
. In other words, even with the existence of a nonrenormalization
theorem, the results on both sides should only be compared at very
large , where Supergravity is applicable.


Background Field Method 
We will follow the Background Field Method as reviewed
in .  is expanded into a background field  and a
fluctuating field , i.e. . Only the part of the action that
is  quadratic in  will be of  interest below.

The Matrix Model action in the DLCQ of M-theory in the maximally
supersymmetric pp-wave background is  :
 
where 

Taking the ratios of any of the -dependent terms to the
-independent  non-derivative terms gives the parameter in
eqn(). In other words, the  assumption stated in the
previous section is identical to treating the new terms  arising from
the pp-wave background as a perturbation to flat space. Note that this
is exactly the opposite of the  approximation made in  ,
where the -independent terms are treated  as perturbations to the
-dependent terms. While the computation of the  1-loop effective
potential is possible in both limits on the Matrix Theory side, an
agreement with Supergravity is possible only in the large  limit
given in eqn().

In what follows, unless stated otherwise, we will always assume the
indices  goes from 1 to 3,  goes from 4 to 9, and  goes from
1 to  9.

In addition to the action above, there are terms arising from the
ghosts and gauge fixing,  which we simply state below:

 

 
Thus, the complete Matrix Theory action is:

 

To simplify the notation, we will put . This factor
can be  restored by dimensonal analysis. It is also convenient to
define  , which corresponds to a loop counting parameter
in the Matrix  Theory.



Expansion About The Backgroud 

The fields , , and  are expanded in the following way,
with a  purely bosonic background:
       

The above background has the interpretation of one graviton (the
source) sitting at the origin(Another possible interpretation
is a transverse five brane at the origin.) , while another
graviton (the probe) approaches  from the position given by  in
the matrix . We will use the shorthand  .

After a Wick rotation, where we define  and , and
at the  same time rotating  to , the quadratic part
of the action  is: (For simplicity, all subsequent
superscripts of  on the  Euclideanized fluctuation fields will be
omitted.)

The Sum Over Mass 
The partition function,  of the above action can be computed
as  a product of functional determinants. The 1-loop effective action
  is then simply related to  via:

 
The 1-loop effective potential is defined as:

 

To first approximation, however, it is not necessary to compute the
functional determinants. As was suggested by Talfjord and Periwal
  and Talyor  , one could deduce the effective
potential by simply evaluating the mass spectrum of the fluctuating
fields. From the masses, the 1-loop contribution to  could be
easily deduced using the formula:

 

The physical reasons for this is that at large distances, i.e. the
limit  where Supergravity is valid, all the string stretching between
the  D0-branes can be assumed to lie in their ground state. This
result can  also be verified using the complete expression for
 in terms of  functional determinants. We provide an argument
for this in Appendix A. In what follows, we will omit the superscript
, assuming this is understood. The contribution from tree
level, which does not concern us  here, is simply the Lagrangian with
 replaced by . Both  contributions will be put back together at
the end in eqn().

One important point to note is that this method is valid only up to
the  lowest powers of , as is already known in the flat space
case. In flat  space, the above formula reproduces every term
predicted by a  Supergravity computation with the right coefficients,
but the Matrix  Theory corrections to Supergravity, i.e. terms with
even higher powers of   and  which would not be found in
Supergravity, will not come  out with the correct coefficients. In
fact, the parameter  can be treated as  the counting parameter
for this purpose. All terms of order , which is  basically
 in the Supergravity language, will be found on the
Supergravity side, but terms on the Matrix Theory side with higher
powers of ,  which represent short distance effects, should be
treated as corrections. To  compute them correctly, one needs to make
use of the complete expression in terms of  functional determinants.

For our purpose, however, the above approach is sufficient. We are not
interested in computating the correction to Supergravity, rather we
would  like to check whether the terms already predicted by
Supergravity in the  pp-wave background can be reproduced by a Matrix
Theory calculation.


A Simple Case 
In the next section we will work out a more efficient method to
compute   without  explicitly diagonalizing the mass
matrix. Nevertheless, it is instructive to work out  the simplest case
in a direct approach to get the basic idea of the computation.

In this simple case, we put  and , while all the
other  are  set to  zero(Note that by putting all 
to zero for , we made sure that  in this case  the Myers term
will not contribute to the mass matrix.) . Here  is a constant,
which can be  interpreted as the impact parameter of the approaching
probe graviton towards the  source sitting at  the origin. In this
case, the mass matrix constructed from eqn(), () and
() is easily diagonalized to give the mass spectrum listed in
Table .
 
 
 
The Mass Spectrum for a Simple Case. The numbers inside the
round brackets indicate the number of physical  degrees of freedom of
the fermions with the given mass. 
 is given by 
. 
It should be noted that the velocity in the table above is measured in
Euclidean time  , i.e.  
. In a comparison with Supergravity, a Wick  rotation back into
Minkowski time    is required, which introduces extra minus
signs in .

With the mass spectrum at hand,  can be evaluated using
eqn():

 
V_eff  =-1 2 (2)
(3 3 +6 6 -8 4 )-1 2 
6r^2+^2/3^2 +10r^2+^2/6^2 +2r^2+_+  
 +
2r^2+_- -8r^2+^2/4^2+v -8r^2+^2/4^2-v -4r


At this point it is useful to restore the factors of , which we
denote as . For instance, the first square root term in the
about equation  becomes:

 

This can in turn be written as:

 

The expression for  given above, being a Matrix Theory
result, is only  expected to match with Supergravity in the large 
limit (if it does at all!). Defining the large  limit by
eqn(), we can then expand the 1-loop effective potential
in powers of . Thus, expanding  gives:

 

Wick rotating , and restoring  gives:

 

The  terms give the factor  , which translates into
 in the Supergravity language. This is the order we are
interested in. We throw away the higher powers of  (which are
always accompanied  by powers of ) because they correspond to
short distance corrections to  Supergravity, just as in flat space.

Here the first term is just the flat space result. The second and the
third term are the interesting ones, with new  and  
dependence created by the pp-wave background. A comparison of their
coefficients with Supergravity will show exact agreement.


Mass Matrix Computation  
In the more general cases, when the velocity and the impact parameter
point in arbitrary directions, calculating the effective potential
 by finding the entire  spectrum, then taking their
square roots and expanding them in powers of  and  becomes
inefficient, since in the most general case this involves finding the
eigenvalues of mass matrices of very high dimension.

Instead, it is possible to make use of the sum over mass formula in
eqn() without explicitly diagonalizing the mass
matrix. Let us denote the  square of the mass matrix as . Since
there is never any mixing between the  bosons, the fermions and the
ghosts, we can study their mass matrices separately.

In terms of , the sum over mass formula becomes:

 

The square root of  can be defined unambigously by its expansion in
powers of   in the Supergravity limit, as was discussed
in Section .  Note that  is defined to be the mass
matrix for real  bosons. If it is taken  to be the mass matrix
for the complex bosons, then there will be an extra factor of  two in
front of .

Simple Recipe for Mass Matrix 

In this subsection we will give a simple recipe for writing out 
for both the bosons and the fermions. The mass for the ghosts is
exactly the same as in  the simple case of Section .

First of all, we should note that the mass of  and 
are always   and  respectively for  and
. The mass of all eight physical  degrees in  is
always . These are independent of the background . Mixing
occurs only among the  and among the  and
. Hence in what  follows, we will denote the
component arising from say  in the bosonic
Lagrangian simply as  without mentioning 
explicitly. Note also that   is symmetric.

Rules for Bosons 


1.  

 2.   mixes  and 

 3.   mixes  and
... etc 


Note that Rule 3 applies only to  but not . Such mixing is
the effect of  the Myers term in the Matrix Theory action.

Rules for Fermions 

The mass matrix for the fermions can be written in a closed form:

 

The General Case 
Once the mass matrix squared  is known, eqn() can then
be used to  compute the 1-loop effective potential explicitly. In
accordance with our earlier  discussions, only terms up to order
 are kept.  After restoring
all factors of , , and , the 0 and 1-loop effective
potential is given by:

  V_eff ^0,1-loop =N_p 2R  (_I=1 ^9 v_I^2+ g_++ ) +
N_p N_s M^9  R^3   15(_I=1 ^9 v_I^2)^2 16
r^7 -^2 _i=1 ^3  v_i^2 96  r^5  - 7 ^2
_a=4 ^9 v_a^2 96  r^5 
  +15^2 32  r^7 [
_i=1 ^3 x_i^2(-_i=1 ^3  v_i^2+_a=4 ^9
v_a^2)+2 (_i=1 ^3 x_i v_i)^2 ] 

+^4N_pN_s R^3M^9 1 768r^7 
32[_i=1 ^3(x^i)^2]^2+[_a=4 ^9(x^a)^2]^2-12_i=1 ^3(x^i)^2_a=4 ^9(x^a)^2
This is the equation to be compared with the Supergravity result.
Notice the effective potential has manifest 
symmetry, as should  be expected from the symmetry of the original
Matrix Theory action. Just as in flat space, one should be
able to recast this 1-loop effective potential in the form 
. A comparison with the Supergravity side will indeed
confirm this, as this  is precisely the form of the effective
potential on the Supergravity side as derived in Appendix B.

Having computed the effective potential on the Matrix Theory side, the
next step will be to compare it with the result from a Supergravity
calculation. Before this could be done, the issue of gauge choice has
to  be addressed.

It is necessary to make a gauge choice when solving the Einstein
equations. A gauge choice corresponds to a choice of the coordinate
system one  uses to describe the physics. On the Matrix Theory side,
such a choice of  coordinates was made right from the very beginning:
The action in  eqn() was written in coordinates that made
the  symmetry manifest. Before a comparison is
possible, a  corresponding choice of coordinates, i.e. a choice of
gauge has to be  made on the Supergravity side.

A comparison of the above equation with the general expression for
 in  eqn() will in the end determine the correct
gauge choice for the  Supergravity computation. There will be a
further discussion about gauge choice in the  Supergravity section.

The Supergravity Effective Potential 
To find the two-body effective
action, one only  needs to solve for the metric perturbation caused by
the source graviton at the linear order  ().

The action is given by:
 
 is the Einstein action for the metric:
 
 is the action for the three-form:
  




 is the action for the source graviton (the subscript  means
"particle"):
 
with  being some constant.

The above action gives the equations of motion for the metric, the
3-form field, and  the source graviton, all listed below.  
 The
Einstein equation:
 
The Maxwell equation:
 
The geodesic equation:
 
 and  are the
stress tensors obtained by varying  and  w.r.t. the metric,
given below:
 
 
 
Setting  to zero means the absence of the source graviton. In
this case, a solution to the above equations of motion is the
pp-wave background.   The metric  and the 4-form field
strength are given by:

 

 
In our convention,  take the values
;   take the values ;
 take the values  ; and  take
the values 

The introduction of a source graviton, i.e. a non-zero , perturbs
the  above pp-wave solution:
 
It suffices to solve the geodesic equation at the zeroth order of
, which gives a  solution
  
and the corresponding stress tensor of the source graviton is then:
 
where  is a constant (note that
 is a constant  for a geodesic) and in what
follows  we will use  instead of . Note that the order of
 is the same  as the order of .  Also note that
the only non-vanishing component of   is
.

In what follows we will integrate everything over the  direction,
thus  getting rid of  and derivatives w.r.t .   On
the Matrix Theory side, the effective potential was only computed up
to 1-loop. In  Supergravity language, that means we are only looking
at order . To  find the effective potential on the
Supergravity side up to this order, we need only  the linearized
(i.e. to the linear order of ) Einstein equation and Maxwell
equation.

We consider static solutions which has no  dependence. Also we
restrict our  attention to metric and gauge field perturbations that
go to zero at infinity.  The linearized Einstein equation in 11
dimension is:
  
where the perturbation to the total stress tensor is given by
 
 is the perturbation to the
stress tensor of the gauge field, which is to be expressed in terms
of the perturbation to the field strength.

First look at the  component of the Einstein equation:

R_- =-1 2 _A=1 ^9
^2h_-  x^Ax^A  and T _- =_11 ^2T_- =_11 ^2 [T_- ]_P=_11 ^2p^+_A=1 ^9(x^A) where
 (as can be readily verified) has been
used.

This gives h_- =_11 ^2p^+ ^4 15 16 1 x ^7 where we use  to denote the 9-dimensional vector in the
transverse  directions.

The  component of the Einstein equation is, R_-A =-1 2 _B=1 ^9 ^2h_-A  x^Bx^B +1 2 _B=1 ^9
^2h_-B  x^Ax^B  and T _-A =0 which gives h_-A =0 Now we look at the linearized Maxwell equation, in terms of the gauge
potential  perturbation  (note


). We choose to work in the  "Lorentz gauge" where
.  The upper  component
of the Maxwell equation gives: _D=1 ^9 ^2_D a_AB- -
_D=1 ^9  _D[h_- F_DAB+ ]=0 Using the
expression for  that we just found, we have:  a_ij- =_11 ^2p^+ ^4 
15 32 _k=1 ^3_ijk x^k x ^7 
while all other 's vanish.  This gives the field
strength: f_-ijk &=&_11 ^2p^+ ^4 
15 32 _ijk [7_i=1 ^3(x^i)^2 x ^9 -31 x ^7 ]

f_-ijb &=&_11 ^2p^+ ^4 
15 32 _k=1 ^3_ijk [7x^kx^b x ^9 ]Next consider the upper  component of the Maxwell
equation. Using the fact that   and  except for
, we have: _D=1 ^9 ^2_D a_ABC =0 hence, all .  Now the  component. Using  
we get _D=1 ^9 ^2_D a_A-+ =0 thus .
Now we go back to look at the  component of the Einstein
equation. Using , we  get  R_+A =-1 2 _B=1 ^9 ^2h_+A  x^Bx^B +1 2 _B=1 ^9
^2h_+B  x^Ax^B  Using
, , and , we get T _+A =0
So we conclude that h_+A =0 Now consider the  component of the Einstein equation R_+- =-1 2 _A=1 ^9 ^2h_+-  x^Ax^A  +1 2 _A=1 ^9  g_++  x^A h_-  x^A   and T _+- =1 6 (^2h_- -f_-123 ) In writing , we made use of the following equations:
[T_+- ]_A&=&^2 4_11 ^2 h_- 

[T_ij ]_A&=&1 4_11 ^2 _ij (-2f_-123 -^2h_- )
 [T_bc ]_A&=&1 4_11 ^2 _bc (2f_-123 +^2h_- )
 [T_ib ]_A&=&-
 4_11 ^2 _j,k=1 ^3_ijk f_-jkb  Solving this Einstein equation we have: h_+- =-^2_11 ^2p^+ ^4 
[5 64 _i=1 ^3(x^i)^2 x ^7 
+1 192 1 x ^5  ] The 
component of the Einstein equation reads: R_AB &=&-1 2  [_C=1 ^9^2h_AB  
x^Cx^C -_C=1 ^9^2h_AC  
x^Bx^C -_C=1 ^9^2h_BC  
x^Ax^C +_C=1 ^9^2h_CC  
x^Ax^B +2^2h_+-   x^Ax^B   ] 
 &+&1 4 
[2h_- ^2g_++   x^Ax^B +2g_++ ^2h_-   x^Ax^B +g_++  x^A h_-  x^B +g_++  x^B h_-  x^A  ]  and T _ij &=&- 1 3 _ij (2f_-123 +^2h_- )
  T _bc &=&1 6 _bc (2f_-123 +^2h_- )
 T _ib &=&-
 4 _j,k=1 ^3_ijk f_-jkb  So far the need to make a gauge choice for the metric has not
arisen. Now to solve for   we must make a gauge choice for the
metric.  Let  and  denote the
complete  inverse metric and Christoffel symbol respectively (by
"complete", we mean  they include both the unperturbed and perturbed
part). We shall fix the  gauge by specifying
.

As can be easily verified, G^ ^+_ &=&_C=1 ^9_Ch_-C =0

G^ ^-_ &=&_C=1 ^9(-h_-C _Cg_++ +_Ch_+C -g_++ _Ch_-C )=0

G^ ^A_ &=&_C=1 ^9_Ch_AC -1 2 _A(_C=1 ^9h_CC +2h_+- -g_++ h_- )
so we need to specify  to fix
the gauge.

Using the above expressions for ,
we can rewrite   as R_AB =-1 2 
[_C=1 ^9^2h_AB  x^Cx^C -(G^ ^A_ 
) x^B -(G^ ^B_  ) x^A +1 2 (g_++  x^A h_-  x^B +g_++  x^B h_-  x^A   )
]   In general relativity we often use the "harmonic gauge" where we set
 (which is satisfied by the
unperturbed pp-wave background). Here, however, we shall opt for a
different gauge.

As derived in the Appendix B, the effective potential is given by:
 
where  is the number of D0-branes forming the probe graviton, and
, . As
 all vanish,  they simply drop out of the effective
potential.

The computation on Matrix Theory side in section  tells
us that in the effective potential there are no terms of the form
 for , nor are there terms of the form
. This suggests we choose the gauge such  that 
, and .  To make , we
set:
 
then, to make , we set: _b(G^ ^i_ )=1 2 _ig_++ _bh_- - 2 _ijk f_-jkb which implies
 
In this gauge, the Einstein equation gives:
 
  

Now let us look at the upper  component of the Maxwell
equation.  It gives the following equations:&
&_D=1 ^9_D^2a_ij+ -g_++ _D=1 ^9_D^2a_ij- -_D=1 ^9_Dg_++ (_Da_ij- +_ia_jD- +_ja_Di- )

&
&+_k=1 ^3_ijk -_D=1 ^9_Dh_Dk +_m=1 ^3(_mh_mk -_kh_mm )+_k[1 2 (g_++ h_- +_D=1 ^9h_DD )]

& &=0 _D=1 ^9_D^2a_bc+ =0 

_D=1 ^9_D^2a_ib+ =0 Solving them gives: a_ij+ &=&^3_11 ^2p^+ ^4 (_k=1 ^3_ijk x^k)1 384x ^7 [-29_m=1 ^3(x^m)^2+_a=4 ^9(x^a)^2]

a_bc+ &=&0
 a_ib+ &=&0 They give the field strength: f_+ijk &=&^3_11 ^2p^+ ^4 _ijk 1 384x ^9 [-58_m=1 ^3(x^m)^2-3_a=4 ^9(x^a)^2+149_m=1 ^3(x^m)^2_a=4 ^9(x^a)^2
]

f_+ijb &=&^3_11 ^2p^+ ^4 (_k=1 ^3_ijk x^k)5 384 
x^b x ^9 [-41_m=1 ^3(x^m)^2+_a=4 ^9(x^a)^2]As can be easily checked, all the  we have found
indeed satisfy the  Lorentz gauge.

Finally, we consider the  component of the Einstein equation:
R_++ &=&-
1 2 _A=1 ^9_A^2h_++ +1 2 _A,B=1 ^9_Ag_++ _Bh_AB -1 4 _A,B=1 ^9_Ag_++ _Ah_BB 

&
&+1 2 _A,B=1 ^9h_AB _A_Bg_++ +1 2 _A=1 ^9_Ag_++ _Ah_+- +1 4 _A=1 ^9g_++ _Ag_++ _Ah_- 

& &- 1 4 _A=1 ^9h_- (_Ag_++ )^2
and T _++ =-
 2 (2f_+123 +_i=1 ^3h_ii )+ 6 g_++ (2f_-123 +h_- ) From this we find h_++ =^4_11 ^2p^+ ^4 
1 6912x ^7 116[_i=1 ^3(x^i)^2]^2+2[_a=4 ^9(x^a)^2]^2-17_i=1 ^3(x^i)^2_a=4 ^9(x^a)^2To summarize, the nonzero components of the metric perturbation are :
  [eqn()],  [eqn()], 
[eqn()],   [eqn()], 
[eqn()]; and the nonzero components of the field  strength
perturbation are:  [eqn()] and
  [eqn()].

Substituting the expressions for the metric into our formula for
 in  eqn(), averaging   over
(i.e. dividing by ), and noting that
, , we find
  
Comparison of the above formula with eqn() on the Matrix
Theory side  shows exact agreement.

We would like to emphasize the approximation involved once again. We
treated the source graviton as a perturbation to the exact pp-wave
background, and the calculation was performed only to first order in
. However the solution that we found for these linearized equations is exact in
.

Discussion and Future Directions  
In this paper, the effective potentials of Matrix Theory and
Supergravity describing  graviton scattering are computed, and they
are found to agree exactly at order  , up to quantum
corrections at short distances.  This provides evidence that the
Matrix Theory action proposed in describes  M-theory in the
pp-wave background. Furthermore, it implies the existence of a
nonrenormalization theorem protecting the terms studied against higher
loop  corrections on the Matrix Theory side. Such nonrenormalization
theorems have been  studied in flat space
. In these papers, the   symmetry in the
transverse space appears to be a crucial ingredient. In the  pp-wave
background, however, this is broken to , so it
will be  interesting to see how the result could be extended in this
case.

Our result at order  agrees with Taylor and Van Raamsdonk's
proposal in for  Matrix Theory in a weakly curved
background up to linear terms.  As mentioned in their discussion,
their proposal  is proven only in the case where the background is
produced by well-defined Matrix  Theory configurations. It is not the
case for the pp-wave background, so their  proposal for the Matrix
Theory in this background, while convincing, is not a proven
fact. Thus the result at , i.e. terms linear in the background,
can be treated  as additional evidence for their proposal, similar to
the explicit calculation in, this time with a nontrivial
 metric component.

The result at order  is beyond linear order in the background,
and hence is a  completely new result. In fact, our calculation
explicitly shows that there are no higher  powers of  in the effective
action of the Supergravity side at the order  . On the
Matrix Theory side, higher powers of  are also not  expected for
long distances. When they do appear, they are always accompanied by
higher powers  of  , which indicates that they are
corrections to Supergravity at short  distances.  However, as it
stands, the corrections for velocity dependent terms are  unreliable
because they are computed using the sum over mass formula, which is
exact  only for terms independent of velocity or terms proportional to
,  as is shown in the Appendix A. Evaluating these
corrections exactly requires going  beyond the sum over mass formula,
and an efficient way of handling the mass matrix  will be of use.

An obvious future direction is to push our Matrix Theory computation
to 2-loop. This can test whether a nonrenormalization
theorem exists for the terms  compared. A 2-loop computation is also
necessary if we are to extend our result to  three-body interactions.

In this paper, a very special bosonic background is chosen, with the
source graviton  sitting at the origin. It may be of interests to
generalise to the  case where neither of the gravitons are fixed at
the origin.







A very interesting prospect is to calculate scattering from a
transverse fivebrane,  recently constructed in. However,
the effect of a transverse fivebrane in this background may only be
visible through a higher loop computation on the Matrix Theory side.

Appendix A 
Sum Over Mass Formula 

In this appendix we will prove the sum over mass formula in 
eqn(). 

The effective action  of a theory expanded upon a background  
in the background field method is given by:

 

Here  is the mass matrix squared for the fluctuating fields, and 
the trace  is over both the functional space and the field component 
indices (which are, besided the  indices, the spacetime indices 
 for the bosons, and the 16 Dirac spinor indices for the 
fermions). 

Take the trace of the boson, for example:

 

The trace over functional space can be computed using the "plane-wave" 
basis wavefunctions , 
 
The trace  is now over only the field component indices. If we define 
 by:
 
Then, the bosonic part of  becomes:
 
The operator in the middle can be rewritten in the following way:
 
Where  is defined as:

 

The commutator terms give corrections to Supergravity, so for the purpose of this paper, which is to see whether Matrix model can reproduce Supergravity results, we can ignore them. This 
claim will be proven shortly, after the result from approximating  is 
examined. In this approximation, we have:
 
Note that , the square root of , can be defined through its 
expansion in powers of 
. 
Putting everything together, and minding the minus signs for the fermions 
and the ghosts, we 
get the sum over mass formula in eqn().
Now, we return to the claim made above, that the commutator terms in  
will not contribute to terms in the Supergravity limit.
To show this, we first write  in a most general form:
 
Here  is a general function of  and its derivatives, and is 
defined  by the above equation. Looking back at the definition of  in 
eqn(), we see that  counts the number of terms involved in forming the 
commutator, and  is the number of derivatives not acting on . For example, when 
, it implies , and , corresponding to the approximation we made 
above. All the other values of  correspond to commutator terms in , and in 
particular,  when , because a commutator takes at least two terms.

Putting  in terms of  into , we will encounter the 
following factor inside the integrand:

 
 is the biggest integer no larger than . In the last line, we 
made use of the fact that  will be integrated from  to 
 so that any odd functions in the integrand will give zero. As a 
result, only terms with even powers of  are kept. Therefore, the 
effective potential becomes:

 

Thus, the effective potential can be recasted in the following form:

 
As before, . The reason these factors of  are 
inserted will be clear shortly. 

In a comparison of 1-loop Matrix Theory with Supergravity, the
relevant  terms on the Supergravity side are proportional to
, which  is of order  on the Matrix Theory
side. This means any terms of  higher powers of  are
irrelevant for such a comparison as they  represent only Matrix Theory
corrections to Supergravity, and finding them is not the  purpose of
this paper. In other words, to examine whether the Matrix  Theory can
reproduce Supergravity in the appropriate limit,  only terms up  to
 need to be kept.

It makes sense, therefore, to examine each factor in  and
count  the powers of  it contains. We begin with the mass
matrix squared. By inspection of the explicit expressions given in
setion , one sees that  can always be written in
the following form:
 
For example, using eqn(), we have:
 
Similarly,  can be constructed using the rules given in section , 
while . 
From the explicit expressions of , it can be shown easily that , 
, and 
. These facts are related to the large number of supersymmetries of our system and will be of use shortly.
The last line in eqn() is a symbolic statement that for any , whether 
positive or negative,  will only give non-negative powers of 
. Another important point to note is that every  arising 
from  is accompanied by a factor of .
Now look at :
Let 
where  is the number -derivatives acting on  inside , and 
 is the number of  inside .
By definition, we have:
 
For ;

For ;

For  consists of commutators. In this case, 
we have:

 
For fixed  and ,  and  have the following extremal values:





The reason  is that  must act at least once on  to give 
non-vanishing commutators like  in .
Look at:
 
where .
Noting , we must have:
 
From this derivation of the lower bound of , we see that the equality holds only 
when  and . Then, eqn() gives:
 
A comparison with Supergravity with one-loop Matrix Theory means keeping terms only up 
to . Therefore, we need only consider the range of  to 
be:
 
For :
There can be no factors of  from  because they increase the 
powers of  beyond 3, hence taking us beyond the limit of Supergravity.
Without any factors of , the effective potential is simply:
 
Here,  is again the trace over the boson minus the trace over the fermions and the 
ghosts.
For :
There can be at most one , either from  or 
 
But for only one , we have:
 
For :
Now it is possible to have  coming from one of the following three 
cases:
(i) Both  come from :
 
(ii)Both  come from :
Since we showed that  when , there is only one -derivative acting on 
 in , we must have either:
(a) 
or  (b) 
.
In either case, .

(iii) One  comes from  and one from 
:
We already showed that  when , so we have:
 
This implies either:
(a) 
or  (b) 

(a) is identical to case (iib) above. (b) is of order  using the fact mentioned before.  
This exhausts all cases contributing to terms up to order 
 in . In particular, we have shown that none of the commutator 
terms in , corresponding to  with  , contributes to terms relevant to Supergravity. This completes the proof of the claim made under equation ().

Appendix B 

Deriving  

The Lagrangian of the probe graviton moving in a curved spacetime with 
metric  is given by(This approach is borrowed from.) :
L =-m-G_ x ^x ^  
=-m-(g_ +h_ )x ^x ^ 
We make a Legendre transformation:
L' =L -P^+_px ^-where 
P^+_p=L  x ^-  
=m1+h_- x ^ -G_ x ^x ^   
When we let , this gives
G_ x ^x ^=2x ^-+g_++ +v^2+h_  
x ^x ^
This is a quadratic equation for , which we will solve for 
, keeping only terms of lowest order of . Recalling that all  are at least of order , we have:

x ^-=-  1 2 [v^2+g_++ +h_++ +g_++ (1 4 g_++ h_- -h_+- )

+_A [2h_+A -h_-A (v^2+g_++ )]v^A+_A,B h_AB v^Av^B ]

+1 8 h_- v^4
-1 2 v^2(h_+- -1 2 g_++ h_-   )
Taking the limit , the  in eqn() is simply , which is the effective potential  that we need. It contains the interaction between the probe and the source up to terms linear in . An alternative way of writing such interaction is:

L  G_   h_ = T^  h_  
This structure was used by Taylor and Van Raamsdonk to identify the effective potentials on both sides.
