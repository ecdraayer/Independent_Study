Introduction 

Two dimensional exactly solvable models with boundaries have
attracted a great deal of research interest recently from the
point of view of boundary conformal field theory, and
critical behavior, but also because of the rich variety
of physical phenomena they display, which in principle can be
exactly investigated (see e.g.-).
There has been also much interest on problems related to quantum
impurities, mainly because of the important role they play in low
dimensional physics, but also because of their
relevance to boundary conformal field theory
. There are numerous studies related to quantum
impurities yielding a great number of interesting and useful
results (see e.g.). In this article we
focus basically on the thermodynamic analysis of lattice
integrable systems in the presence of quantum impurities and
integrable open boundaries.

For both integrable lattice models and relativistic integrable
field theories, in the bulk, the corresponding free energy has been
derived and the conformal properties have been extensively studied
- by means of the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz.
It is however of great interest to extend these studies for
integrable models with boundaries. In analogy to the bulk case,
when boundaries are added, the corresponding boundary free energy
and the so called  function, which characterizes theground state degeneracy due to the boundaries,
 can be specified  by means of the
thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. On the other hand statistical systems
at the critical point it is known to display conformal invariance
, therefore they can be associated with certain
conformal field theories. The low temperature behavior of the free
energy per unit length of such system, in the bulk, is described by
 f(T) = f_0  - c 6 u T^2 +,
  T1, where  is the central charge of the effective
conformal field theory. Furthermore, when boundaries are added the obtained free energy is modified up to an  contribution ( denotes the size of the systems) namely,
 f(T)= f_0 (T) -TL  g,  
where the ground state degeneracy  is expected to be related
with the boundaries of the system.One of the main aims, when studying such systems is to employ proper techniques in order to specify the central charge and the ground state degeneracy -when boundaries are present.

As already mentioned from the integrable systems point of view,
the central charge and the ground state degeneracy  can be
identified by employing thermodynamic Bethe ansatz techniques (see
e.g.-,
). In this study in particular the alternating integrable spin chain
 and the  model in
the presence of a quantum impurity ("Kondo type" boundaries see
e.g.) are investigated via the thermodynamic
Bethe ansatz, and the corresponding free energy is derived at low
and high temperature. The relevance of the results for the
 model to the boundary flows in minimal
 and generalized coset models is
discussed. Finally the alternating open spin chain with diagonal
and non-diagonal integrable boundaries is considered and the
corresponding boundary free energy and the  functions for the
left and right boundaries are determined by first principle
calculations at low and high temperature.



Quantum Impurity 

The alternating spin chain 

Let us first focus on the alternating spin chain in
the presence of a quantum impurity. For what follows it is
necessary to introduce the basic constructing element of the
model, namely the  matrix, which is a solution of the
Yang-Baxter equation 
R_12 (_1  - _2 ) R_1 3 (_1 )
R_23 (_2 ) = R_23 (_2 ) R_1 3 (_1 )
R_1 2 (_1  - _2 ).  We consider
the  matrix obtained in, namely
 R_0k ^1,s  =
(+ i (12  +^3  S^3 ) ) + (^+ S^-  +^-  S^+ )


 
 

                                                          
where
,   act in general, on a  dimensional space
, and they satisfy the following commutation
relations [ S^+ , S^-] &=&  2 i S^3 i   ,   [ S^3
, S^] = S^, 
 S^3 0 &=& S0 ,  S^+ 0 =0. 
 We can now define the transfer matrix of the
chain (If we derive the transfer matrix of the model with
proper inhomogeneities we obtain massless relativistic dispersion
relations for the particle-like excitations of the model
.)  t= tr_0  T_0 () where 
T_0 () = R_0 2N+1 ^q ()R_0 2N ^1 ()  R_0
2N-1 ^2 ()R_0 2 ^1 ()  R_0 1
 ^2 () ,  and  is related to the
spin  () representation ( is related to the
spin  representation) (). Following the
standard Bethe ansatz method described in e.g.,-, the Bethe equations are obtained
 
where
 
Notice that the main difference between the usual bulk case (without impurities) and ()
is the appearance of the  term in the left hand side of
() due to the presence of the spin 
impurity. Moreover we should mention that , 
play the role of "flavors" in accordance with the picture in, where the spin  ( flavor) chain
is studied with impurity of spin .

 In the thermodynamic limit, , the string hypothesis is valid, namely
the solutions of equation () can be grouped into strings of
length  with the same real part and equidistant imaginary parts
_ ^(n,j)  &=&_ ^n + i
2 (n+1-2j),  j=1,2,...,n, 

_ ^0,s &=&_ ^0 +i 2 ,
  where  is real, and
 is the negative parity string and  is
real. In order to formulate the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz we consider all the strings with length 
plus the negative parity string.
The Bethe ansatz equations () can be written after we
apply the string hypothesis 
X_nq (_ ^n)_j=
1 ^2 X_nq_j  (_ ^n)^N  =
(-)^n _m= 1 ^-1  _M_m  E_nm (_ ^n -
_ ^m )
_M_0  G_n1 (_ ^n -_ ^0 )
  

g_q (_ ^0)_j=
1 ^2 g_q_j  (_ ^0)^N  = -_m=
1 ^-1  _M_m  
G_1m (_ ^0 -_ ^m )_M_0  
e_2 (_ ^0 -_ ^0 ),  where
 
and , , and  are given in the appendix ().

We introduce the  densities of the holes  and pseudo-particles
, and once we take the logarithm and the derivative of the Bethe ansatz equations (), () we conclude _n ()=
12 ( Z_nq_1  ()+ Z_nq_2  ()) +
1L  Z_nq (-_m=1 ^-1 A_nm 
* _m () - B_1n  * _0 () 

 -(_0 () + _0 ()) =  12 (b_q_1  ()
+b_q_2  ()) +1L b_q ( -_m=1 ^-1 B_1m  * _m ()
-a_2 *_0 ()  where 
is the density of the negative parity string, and  is the
length of the spin chain(We treat the impurity, which
sits at the  site of the chain, separately, therefore 
is the length of the bulk part.) , and the quantities ,
, , and  are given in the appendix
(), (), (), and (). It is also
convenient to solve  in terms of 
, therefore we consider the convolution of the
first of the equations () with the inverse of
 A_nm ^-1  = _nm  -
s()(_nm+1  +_nm-1 ) where 
, 
.
 Having in mind the identities
A_nm ^-1  * Z_mq_i  () = s()
_nq_i  ,     A_nm ^-1  * B_1m () = - s() _n
-2   we obtain the following expressions  
_n () &=& 1 2  s()
(_nq_1  +_nq_2  ) - _m=1 ^-1 
A_nm ^-1 * _m () -_n -2  s *
_0 () 
 &+& _n -2  s *s *
_0 () +1L s() _nq  

_0 () &=&- _0 () +s*
_-2 ()  note the extra
 contribution term in the first of the two above
equations, which is due to the impurity. Let us now derive the free energy of
the system , which is given by

f= e-Ts &=& -
12 _n=1 ^-1  _- ^ d
(Z_nq_1  () +Z_nq_2  ())_n ()-12  _- ^ d(b_q_1  ()
+b_q_2  ())_0 ()
&-& T_n=1 ^-1 
_- ^  d (_n ()
(1+_n () _n () ) + 
_n () (1+
_n () _n () )) 

&-& T_- ^ d (_0 ()
(1+_0 () _0 () ) + 
_0 () (1+ _0 () 
_0 () )). 
The thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations are obtained by minimizing the free energy () and by virtue of (), we conclude that they coincide with the ones of the
model without impurities and they are
given by  T 
(1+_n ()) &=& -1
2 (Z_nq_1  ()+Z_nq_2  ()) + T_m=1 ^
-1  A_nm * (1+_m ^-1 ()) 

&-& T B_1n *(1+_0 ^-1 ()) 
 T 
(1+_0 () 1+_0 ^-1 () )
&=& -1 2 (b_q_1  ()+b_q_2  ()) +T
_m=1 ^-1  B_1m * (1+_m ^-1 ()
) 
 &-& T a_2 *(1+_0 ^-1 ()),
 
where .
 Alternatively we can write the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations
by virtue of () in the following form, 
, _n ()
&=&s()*T (1+ _n+1 ())(1+
_n-1 ()) -12 s()(_nq_1  
+_nq_2  ) 
 &+& _n 
-2 s()*T ( 1+ _0 ^-1 () ) 

_-1 () &=& s()*T (1+ _
-2 ()) 
 _0 () &=& - s()*T 
(1+ _-2 ()).  Although the
thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations remain the same as in the
bulk case, the free energy of the model is modified because of the
presence of the quantum impurity. In particular, there is a non
trivial contribution to the free energy which is given by the
following expression, after we apply () and
(), () to () f = e_0  + f_0 
+f_b  +O(1L )  where  is
the bulk free energy given by f_0  = -T 
2 _- ^ d
s()(1+_q_1  ())(1+_q_2  ()).
  is the energy of the the state with the
seas of strings with length ,  filled  e_0  =
-14  _i,j =1 ^2 _- ^ d
Z_qi q_j  () s() -12L  _j
=1 ^2 _- ^ dZ_qq_j  (s()  where the non-trivial 
 contribution to the bulk ground state energy is due to the
impurity. Finally,  is the free energy contribution of the
impurity (after we make the shift 
) f_b  = - T L  _- ^ 
ds(1  T ) (1+_q ()).
We can accurately evaluate differences of
boundary free energies, or ratios of  functions
(), for different temperatures and not specific
values at each temperature. This happens basically because an
overall  contribution, which can not be explicitly
evaluated, may survive in the bulk calculation (see
()) of the free energy as well (see also
). The boundary free energy, and the
corresponding -function () can be computed at
any temperature by employing numerical methods, however it is
possible to make analytical calculations at 
"weak-coupling" and  "strong-coupling" point (see
e.g.).

In particular, for  the main contribution to the
integral in () comes from the 
 behavior. The corresponding behavior of
 is given by
 (see also) (1+_n ^ )^-1  &=&1(n+1)^2  ,
  n=1,
 (1+_-1 ^ )^-1  &=&1 ,
  (1+_0 ^ )^-1  = 1- 1 ,  
which obviously does not depend on
, . The boundary free energy contribution is for
 "weak-coupling" point (see e.g.),
f_b ^  = -T L 
(q+1).  
In the special value where 
 the boundary energy becomes following () f_b ^  =
-T2L  (),  which is the half  of the expected value.
In the isotropic case ,  can take any value
from 1 to  and the impurity contribution is given by
().

When  the main contribution to the integral in () comes
from the  behavior - recall that we considered the shift
. The quantity  for 
 and  is given by
 (1+_n ^0 )^-1  &=& 
^2 (q_1  +2 ) ^2 ((n+1) q_1 
+2 ) ,   n=1, ,q_1 -1,   (1+_q_1  ^0 ) =1 

(1+_n ^0 )^-1  &=& ^2 (q_2  - q_1  + 2 ) 
^2 ((n-q_1 +1) q_2 -q_1  +2 ) ,
  n=q_1 +1, ,q_2 -1,   (1+_q_2  ^0 ) =1 

(1+_n ^0 )^-1 
&=&1 (n-q_2 +1)^2  ,   n=q_2 +1, ,

(1+_0 )^-1  &=&1 ,   (1+_0 ^0 )^-1  = 1- 1
 .  where .
The situation is more complicated now, because the behavior of  depends clearly on the flavors (see ()).
In particular, for  the boundary entropy is ,
and
this is the
completely screened case (see e.g).
For 

f_b ^0  = - T L  ((q+1)q_1 +2  ) 
(q_1 +2  )   
this is the behavior of the non-trivial "strong-coupling" point
(see also) with flavor  and impurity spin . For 

f_b ^0  = -T L  ((q-q_1 +1)q_2 -q_1 +2  ) 
(q_2 -q_1 +2  ) ,  
this case also corresponds to a "strong-coupling" point, with flavor 
and a reduced spin impurity .
For 

f_b ^0 = -T L (q-q_2 -1)  this is the partially screened case with
 reduced impurity spin . Finally, for  ()
f_b ^0 =-T 2L  (-q_2 ).  
We should emphasize again  that the boundary free energy is calculated up to an overall
 contribution which we are not able to derive explicitly. Therefore, we
consider only differences of the free energy for different temperatures, and from that
via relation () we deduce the ratio of the  function,

g_  g_0   =  12 (1+_q ^ )
(1+_q ^0 )   where 
is derived in  (), ().
The model under study is related to  and
 model, as already concluded  in.
Indeed the central charge conjectured in, and found in is given
by
c=3q_1  
q_1  +2  +3 q q +2   and
it is expressed as the sum of the central
charges of the   models at level  and 
 (). Therefore we expect that our results ()-(), ()
should be related to
boundary flows in  models in analogy to the bulk case.
Finally, we should note that our results for the free energy ()-()
for  coincide with the ones found in for the spin 
chain with spin  impurity.

In general the impurity sitting at the  site of the chain can
be thought as an immobile "particle" with constant rapidity
. Therefore, the particle-like excitations of the chain
can interact (scatter) with the impurity giving rise to specific
scattering amplitudes see e.g., which we are
going to study in detail elsewhere. The scattering should involve
in addition to the usual  part (in the isotropic limit of our
model),  type scattering as well. This is expected since our
chain is related to  model,
and it is known (see e.g.) that
the -matrix that describes  models has apart from the
 invariant part an  part as well, namely
 S_WZW_k   = S_SU(2)  S_RSOS ^(k) .
  is the usual   matrix
and  is the  matrix for the  model with
restriction parameter  see also.

The generalized  model 

It is known that the effective conformal field theory for the critical 
model is the unitary minimal model , whereas the critical 
model corresponds to the generalized  coset model  
. It has been also recently shown that the effective
conformal field theory for the generalized critical  model
() consists
of two copies of  coset models, namely 
.
Our aim is to study the boundary behavior of the generalized 
model, with "Kondo type" boundaries. In particular, the corresponding boundary free
energy and the -function will be derived, and their relevance to boundary
flows of conformal field theories will be discussed.

To describe the model, an orthogonal lattice of 
horizontal and  vertical sites is considered. The Boltzmann
weights  associated with every site are defined as
 
With every face
 of the lattice an integer  is associated, and every
pair of adjacent integers satisfies the following restriction
conditions, 0l_i+1  - l_i  +P 2P, (a) 
 P l_i+1  + l_i  2-P, (b)  where
 for  odd,  for  even (let 
), for  and  for  for the horizontal pairs, while 
for the vertical
pairs (array type II).

 The fused Boltzmann weights
have been derived by Date  in and they are
given by

w^q_i ,1 (a_1 , a_q_i +1 ,b_q_i +1 ,b_1 )
=_a_2  a_q_i    _k=1 ^q_i  w^1,1 (a_k ,
a_k+1 ,b_k+1 ,b_k +i(k-q_i ))

where  are arbitrary numbers satisfying
.  are the Boltzmann weights for the 
model, they are
non vanishing as long as the condition ((a)) is
satisfied, and for  they are given by the following expressions 
w(l,l1,l,l1 )&=& h(i-)  

w(l1,l,l1,l )&=& -h()h_l+1  h_l  

w(l1,l,l1,l )&=& h(w_l )h_1 
h_l    where,    and  are Jacobi theta functions and,
 
 We are interested in the critical case where  becomes a simple
 hyperbolic function i.e., 
h() =  ,  
 ,
 and  are arbitrary constants.
 Furthermore,
w^q_i , p (a_1 ,
b_1 ,b_q+1 ,a_q+1 )=_k=0 ^p-2 _j=0 ^q_i -1  
( h( i(k-j)+) )^-1  
 _a_2  a_q  
_k=1 ^p w^q_i ,1 (a_k , b_k ,b_k+1 ,a_k+1 
+i (k-1)), again  are arbitrary
numbers satisfying , and the pairs
,  and ,   satisfy
(), for . The fused weights satisfy the
Yang-Baxter equation in the following form _g 
w^pq (a,b,g,f)w^ps (f,g,d,e
+)w^qs (g,b,c,d) 
 = _g 
w^qs (f,a,g,e)w^ps (a,b,c,g+
)w^pq (g,c,d,e).  Here we only
need the explicit expressions for  which are
 
w^q_i ,1 (l+1,l'+1,l',l 
))=h_q_i -1 ^q_i -1 (-)h_a 
h(ib-)h_l   

w^q_i ,1 (l+ 1,l'-1,l',l ))=h_q_i -1 ^q_i -1 (-)h_b h(+ia)
h_l  

w^q_i ,1 (l-1,l'+1,l',l 
))=h_q_i -1 ^q_i -1 (-)h_c h(id-) h_l   

w^q_i ,1 (l- 1,l'-1,l',l 
))=h_q_i -1 ^q_i -1 (-)h_d h(ic-) h_l  
 where a=l+l'-q_i  
2 ,   b=l'-l+q_i  2 ,    c=l-l'+q_i  2 ,
   d=l+l'+q_i  2 , 
and

h_k ^q () = _j=0 ^q-1  h(+i(k-j)). 
 It is obvious that  are periodic functions,
 because they involve only simple hyperbolic functions (), ()
, ), i.e.
 
w^q_i ,1 (a,b,c,d+i) = (-)^q_i  w^q_i ,1 (a,b,c,d).
 
Now we can define the transfer matrix of the 
model T^q_1 ,q_2 , q;pb_1 b_2N+1   _a_1  
a_2N+1   &=& _j=1 ^2N-1 w^q_1 ,p (a_j ,a_j+1 ,
b_j+1 ,b_j )w^q_2 ,p (a_j+1 ,a_j+2 ,
b_j+2 ,b_j+1 )
 & &w^q,p (a_2N+1 ,a_2N+2 ,
b_2N+2 ,b_2N+1 )where we impose periodic boundary
conditions, i.e.  and . By finding the
eigenvalues of the transfer matrix we end up with the Bethe ansatz equations of the model,
(see also)
 
  It is important to mention that the eigenstates
of the model are states which satisfy (see also)
 
To formulate the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz for the  model we consider all the strings () with length  ,. The densities of the corresponding holes and pseudo-particles are derived from the
Bethe ansatz equations (), after we insert all the allowed strings, and they satisfy  
_n ()= 12 (Z_nq_1  ^() (
)+Z_nq_2  ^() ()) + 1L 
Z_nq ^() (- _m=1 ^
-2 A_nm ^() 
* _m ().

 


, where . From the constraint () it follows that
, then the density of the  string can be
written
in terms of the remaining densities
 
_-2 () = ^0 ()-_m=1 ^a_-2 -m ^(-2) *_m ()  where
 is given in the appendix () with , and ^0 () =
 (q_1  2 ) + 
(q_2  2 ) 4 (2 )
((-2)2 )  + 1L (q 2 ) 2
(2 )
((-2)2 ) .
By means of the relation () the equation
() can be rewritten in the following form 
_n ()= 12 (Z_nq_1  ^(
-2) ()+ Z_nq_2  ^(-2) ())+ 1L Z_nq ^(
-2) (- _m=1 ^
-3 A_nm ^(-2) 
* _m (),  
,  are given by (),
(), with . Following the standard procedure
of minimizing the free energy of the system (,  is derived by ()) we obtain
the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations which are the same as in
the bulk T(1+_n ()) =
-12 (Z_nq_1  ^(-2) ()+Z_nq_2  ^(
-2) ()) + _m=1 ^-3  A_nm ^(-2) * T
(1+_m ^-1 ()),  alternatively we
can write _n () &=&s()*T (1+
_n+1 ())(1+ _n-1 ()) -1
2 s()(_nq_1   +_nq_2  ).  
 The
corresponding free energy is f(T)= e_0  + f_0  +f_b 
+O(1L )  where  is given by
() and  is the bulk part of the free energy
given by (). We wish to compute the non-trivial boundary
part of the free energy, which is given as in the previous case
-for the alternating spin chain- by ().
Again we can evaluate differences of free energies at 
and . For this purpose we need the solutions of 
(), for  and . For 
, the main contribution in () comes for
 the solution is 
(1+_n ^ )^-1  =^2 ( ) 
^2 ((n+1)  ) ,   n=1, , -3. 
and for  the main contribution to the free energy
() comes for , and the
corresponding solution is (1+_n ^0 )^-1 
&=& ^2 (q_1  +2 ) ^2 ((n+1)

q_1  +2 ) ,   n=1, , q_1 -1,   (1+_q_1  ^0 ) =1 

(1+_n ^0 )^-1 &=& ^2 (q_2  - q_1  + 2 ) 
^2 ((n-q_1 +1) q_2 -q_1  +2 ) ,
  n=q_1 +1, , q_2 -1,   (1+_q_2  ^0 ) =1 

(1+_n ^0 )^-1 &=& ^2 (2  ) 
^2 ((n - q_2  +1) -q_2  ) ,   n=q_2 +1,
,  
We observe that the solution
at  does not depend on , while at 
the solution clearly depends on the values of .
Having in mind the above
solutions we are ready to derive ratios of  functions, in
particular g_  g_0   =  1
2 (1+_q ^ )(1+_q ^0 ) ,
 where  are given by
(), ().

It is worth making some remarks concerning (),
(), and (). In the special case where
 we recover the results of for
boundary flows in minimal models , (), whereas for
 we recover the results of for
boundary flows in generalized  coset models 
. The corresponding  matrix for the generalized coset
 model conjectured in is given by
S = S_RSOS ^(k) S_RSOS ^(l) , and in the limit
 it reduces to  given in ().
Again from (), () and ()
the structure 

 of the effective conformal field theory is manifest
(compare with the boundary flow in  coset models).



Open Boundaries 

The main aim of this section is the investigation of the thermodynamics of the
alternating spin chain in the presence of integrable boundaries. To construct
the spin chain with boundaries in addition to the  matrix
another constructing element, the  matrix, is needed. The 
matrix is a solution of the reflection (boundary Yang-Baxter)
equation, R_12 (_1 -_2 )
K_1 (_1 )
R_2 1 (_1 +_2 ) K_2 (_2 ) 

= K_2 (_2 )  R_12 (_1 +_2 )
K_1 (_1 ) R_21 (_1 -_2 ) .
 
In what follows we are going to use Sklyanin's formalism
 in order to construct the model with boundaries.
The corresponding transfer matrix  for the open
alternating chain of  sites and ,
 spins is (see also e.g.,),  t() = _0  K_0 ^+ ()
T_0 () K^- _0 () T_0 (),
 where(We could have considered =odd and put an
impurity at the  site of the chain. Then we would have an
impurity contribution to the free energy similar to the one in
paragraph 2.)  T_ 0 () = R_0N ^1 () R_0N-1
 ^2 ()R_02 ^1 () R_01 ^2 (),
  T_ 0 () = R_10 ^2 () R_20
 ^1 ()R_N-10 ^2 () R_N0 ^1 (),
 and  where ,  are arbitrary boundary parameters for the left and right boundaries, and  is the matrix
K^- () = (
          ).
                                                          It is interesting to point out that the
diagonal boundaries for the critical  spin chain
() correspond to Dirichlet boundary
conditions for the sine-Gordon model,.
Presumably the purely anti-diagonal  matrix
-which completely breaks the  symmetry- should
correspond to Neumann boundary conditions for the sine-Gordon
model.


The diagonal  matrix 

We consider first the case in which the  matrix is diagonal,
namely . The corresponding Bethe ansatz for the model,
are known and they are given by
 
where  are boundary
parameters for the left right boundaries of the chain and they are
related to some external magnetic field acting on the boundaries.
Here, for simplicity we consider  to be integers less or
equal to .
The corresponding densities of pseudo-particles and holes, in analogy to
() satisfy
(again we consider as in the bulk all the strings  and the negative parity string ())
& & _n ()=Z_nq_1  ()+
Z_nq_2  () +1L  K_n  - _m=1 ^-1 A_nm 
* _m () - B_1n  * _0 () 

 &-& (_0 () + _0 ()) =b_q_1  
+b_q_2   +1L  K_0  -_m=1 ^-1 B_1m  *
_m () -a_2 *_0 ()  
where  is the length of the chain and, K_n ()
&=& a_n ()+ b_n ()- 
Z_nx^+  ()+Z_nx^-  () -1 
 
K_0 () &=& a_1 ()+ b_1 ()- 
b_x^+  ()+b_x^-  () + 1  
, , and  are given in the
appendix by (), and (). The unit that appears in
the expressions for ,  is a result of the
subtraction of a   term from the densities (see
also). This subtraction seems necessary for the
accurate derivation of the density, because in the boundary case
's can take values from  to , as opposed to
the bulk case where 's take all the values from 
to .

The free energy for the model with open boundaries is given by
() up to a  factor in front of the
expression. The appearance of the factor  in front of
all the integrals comes from the fact that we originally derived
the integrals from zero to infinity. After we minimize the free
energy, we obtain the same thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations as
in (), (). Finally, by virtue of (),
() the following expression for the free energy is
obtained f=f_0 +f_b  +O(1L ) where  is the
bulk free energy given by f_0  = e_0 - T
2 _- ^  d 
s()(1+_q_1  ())(1+_q_2  ())
 is the bulk part of the energy of the state with the
seas of strings ,  filled, e_0 = - 1
4 _i, j=1 ^2 _- ^ d
Z_q_i q_j  ()s(). 
 and the boundary contribution to the free energy is
f_b  = -T2L  _n=1 ^
-1 _- ^ d
K_n ()(1+_n ^-1 ()) +T2L 
_- ^ d
K_0 ()(1+_0 ^-1 ()). 
From the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations () we
consider the convolution of  with the equation of
() for  and  (with a (-) sign in front of
the equation for  ), we also consider the convolution of
 with the equation for the negative parity string,
recall also relations (). Moreover, we consider the
equations () for all  and the
negative parity string, with a (-) sign infront. We add all the
above equations and we end up with the following expression for
the free energy f_b =e_b  + f_b  =e_b  +TL 
(1+_-1 ) +T2L s* (1+_x^+  )-T
2L s* (1+_x^-  ) where  is the boundary energy
contribution  e_b  &=& -14L _- ^ 
ds()( K_q_1  ()+
K_q_2  ()) 
 &=&  -1
2L _- ^  ds() (12 
_i=1 ^2 
(a_q_i  ()+b_q_i  ()-Z_q_i x^+  +Z_q_i x^-  )-
()).The boundary contribution to the free
energy for each boundary then is f_b ^ =T2
L  (1+_-1 ) T4L  (1+_x^  ),
and the corresponding ratios of the
 () functions for the left and right
boundaries () are g_ ^  
g_0 ^   = - 12 (1+_-1 ^ )
(1+_-1 ^0 )   1
4 (1+_x^  ^ )(1+_x  ^0 ) .
 The last term of the above equation, for
 integer less than , corresponds to the quantum
impurity contribution (up to a  factor), which has
been already computed explicitly for ,
(), (). We focus on the first term of
(), which we compute again for . It
is easy to conclude from the solution for 
(), () - 12 (1+_
-1 ^ )(1+_-1 ^0 )  = -12  
-q_2  .  The result () is
also valid for the spin  chain. In the isotropic
limit the above ratio () becomes unit, i.e. there is no
difference in the boundary free energy at low and high
temperature. In the special case where  we
recover the result found in for the sine-Gordon model
with boundaries (In the repulsive regime, i.e. when no
bound states "breathers" exist, we can make the following
identification   or 
.) , and also the result of
 for the  spin chain with open boundaries at zero
external magnetic field. Note that for  there
is no boundary
parameter dependence. 





The non-diagonal  matrix 

We consider, for the first time in a spin chain model, the more
general case of the open alternating spin chain with non-diagonal
boundaries. The corresponding Bethe ansatz for the  model at
roots of unity have been recently derived in. The
novelty of the method described in is basically that
it does not rely on the existence of a reference state
"pseudo-vacuum". It was shown then in, that in the
case where  () the problem of
finding the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix ()
reduces to a set of functional relations which can be written in
the following compact form, (see also)
detM[^q_1 ,q_2  ()]=0 where
 
where

f^q_1 ,q_2  () & =& -^N (+iS_1  +i2 ) ^N  (+iS_2  +i2 )(2+2i) (2+i) 
 & &((+i)(2  ^2  2)
 
and

f^q_1 ,q_2  () = f^q_1 ,q_2  (--2i),  f_k ^q_1 ,q_2  ()=f(+ik)  
Let now  be
the null vector of the matrix () with 
and

Q() = _j=1 ^M 
(j )(+_j +i)
 


  
then the eigenvalues are given by the following expression
^q_1 ,q_2  () =
f_0 ^q_1 ,q_2  (-Q(
+i) Q()  +
f_0 ^q_1 ,q_2  ()Q(Q() .
 
Finally, from the analyticity of the eigenvalues we obtain the Bethe ansatz equations
&&(_ 
+ i 2 (2(_  - i 
2 (2+1)) + ^2 ^2  (2 _ -i) 
(_  - i 2 (2
(_  + i 
2 (2+1)) + ^2  ^2  (2 _  +i)  

&&
g_1 (_ )e_1 (_ )e_q_1  (_ )^N 
e_q_2  (_ )^N = -_M 
e_2(_ -_ )
e_2(_ +_ ).  Note that
the boundary parameters at the left and right boundaries have been
considered to be the same. In fact, the boundary parameters have
to be tuned properly (i.e.  and 
) so that the method described in can be
applied. Note also that in this case the Bethe ansatz states have
to satisfy the following constraint, M=(S_1 +S_2 )N
2 -12 .  The above constraint follows from
the asymptotic behavior of the transfer matrix for 
, in particular from () it can be deduced
t() - 2 e^(2N +4)+2i
+iN   by comparing the later equation with
the eigenvalues () we obtain the constraint
().


Let us first consider the case with purely anti-diagonal 
matrices, namely  becomes very big. Then it is obvious
that the above Bethe ansatz equations () take the form

g_1 (_ )^-2 e_1 (_ )^-2 g_1 (_ )e_1 (_ )e_q_1  (_ )^N 
e_q_2  (_ )^N  = -_M 
e_2(_ -_ )
e_2(_ +_ ).  Relation
() does not impose in this case any extra restriction
on the densities as opposed to the case of the  model for
which a similar relation () holds true, and it imposes
restrictions on the hole densities (i.e. 
). Therefore, the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations are the
same as in the bulk case (), and by following exactly the
same procedure as in the diagonal case, but now with 
K_n () = - b_n ()- a_n () -1,
  K_0 () = - b_1 ()-a_1 () + 1
 we find that the non-trivial boundary part of
the free energy becomes f_b ^ =T4 L 
(1+_1 ). Moreover the boundary
contribution to the ground state energy is given by e_b  =
-12L _- ^  ds() 
(12  _i=1 ^2 
(-a_q_i  ()-b_q_i  ()) -()
).It is worth noticing that the state with the seas of strings
with length ,  filled, is an allowed state for the
case with anti-diagonal boundaries, because the constraint
() is satisfied. The ratios of the 
functions for the left and right boundary () are
given by g_ ^  g_0 ^   =   - 1
4 (1+_1 ^ )(1+_1 ^0 ) 
 where the function
 is given, for  and
, by (), (). Notice that for 
 (at )  and this is
-as in the presence of an impurity at the end of the chain-
the completely screened case.

We are not going to treat the general case in full detail here,
since this is mostly a problem of mathematical manipulations, he
hope though to report on this in detail elsewhere. Let us however
present the general concept of such computation for the special
simple case where , the so called "free boundary
conditions", then the Bethe ansatz equations become 
e_2+1 (_ )^-1 e_2 )
e_1 ^-2 (_ )e_1 (_ )g_1 (_ )e_q_1  (_ )^N e_q_2  (_ )^N 
= -_M  e_2(_ -_ )
e_2(_ +_ ).  It is
evident that the later Bethe ansatz equations have a similar
structure with () -up to the  term in the
LHS of ()-  with  and
 (Following
 we have to chose for the "free boundary conditions"
, which is not an
integer) . The boundary part of the free energy is given again by
() and the quantities  and  are
given by, K_n () &=& -a_n ()+ 
b_n ()- Z_nx^+  ()+Z_nx^-  () -1

 K_0 () &=& a_1 ()- 
b_1 ()- b_x^+  ()+b_x^-  () + 1
 with . It remains to
treat expression () at high and low
temperature, but this is relatively easy to do because the
solutions for ,  are known at 
and  (), (). Basically we have to
focus on the part of expression () that
involves the terms ,  for
 non-integer. The remaining  independent part
of the boundary free energy (), denoted as
, can be easily computed by repeating the steps of
the previous section, and it is given by f_b ^(1)  =
-12L _- ^  ds() 
(12  _i=1 ^2 
(-a_q_i  ()+b_q_i  ())- ()) +
TL  (1+_-1 )+ T2L  (1+_1 ).
 The  dependent part of the boundary
free energy, denoted as  (with terms that involve
, ), which needs to be computed
explicitly for  non-integers, has the form 
f_b ^(2)  &=& -T2L  _n=1 ^
-1 _- ^ d(Z_nx^-  ()
-Z_nx^+  ())(1+_n ^-1 ()) 
 &+&
T2L  _- ^ d
(b_x^-  ()-b_x^+  ())
(1+_0 ^-1 ()).  Again
once we make the shift 
we can compute  analytically, at 
having in mind the expressions for ,  (),
(), and ,  at high and low
temperatures (), (). More specifically,
expression () can be written as 
  where at 
, f_b ^(2)(0,) (x^ ) =T2L 
_n=1 ^-1  
Z_nx^  (0)(1+_n ^-1 )^(0,)  T2L 
b_x^  (0) (1+_0 ^-1 )^(0,) .
 Naturally, the case is similar when
diagonal boundaries with  non-integer, are
considered, i.e. the  dependent part of the free energy
() is given again by ().
Eventually the computation of the expression ()
reduces to a simpler problem, which is the derivation of the exact
Fourier transforms of  and  when  is
non-integer. In particular, expression () for 
 is valid as long as , while expression ()
for  is also valid as long as .

Let us point out that the results of this section are novel not only for the fused model
under study, but also for the case , which corresponds to the  model (sine-Gordon model).

Discussion 

In this investigation we focused on the  "boundary properties"
of the alternating spin chain and the  model,
therefore we considered both models with certain integrable
"boundaries". A quantum impurity was added at the last site of
the chain ("Kondo type" boundary see also), and
the immediate result was a non-trivial contribution to the ground
state energy of the system, as well as in the free energy. We were
able to explicitly evaluate the non-trivial contribution to the
boundary free energy at low and high temperature. A similar
investigation was realized for the  model
(see also) and the obtained results, for special
values of , , compared with the known boundary flows
in unitary minimal models and generalized 
coset theories.  For general values of ,
 our results are rather novel for both the alternating spin
chain and the  model.

Furthermore, the alternating chain with diagonal and non-diagonal
boundaries was investigated, and again the presence of the
boundaries resulted in a non-trivial contribution to the free
energy. This contribution gave rise to the  function ("ground
state degeneracy") along the lines described in. We
were able to derive ratios of the  function for the left and
right boundaries, at low and high temperatures. In the diagonal
case for  the boundary parameter
independent part of the ratio of the  functions coincides with
the one found in and for zero external
magnetic field. We believe the results of this section are also
novel, in particular for the anti-diagonal case our results are
rather new even for .

For completeness the thermodynamics of the 
model with open boundaries should be also investigated. It
would be also of great interest to extend the thermodynamic
analysis for spin chains and  models related to higher
rank algebras. Furthermore, the derivation of the
Bethe ansatz equations for non-diagonal boundaries, is an essential step towards
the investigation of exact non-diagonal boundary  matrices in the spin chain framework.
Let us finally note that a new non-trivial "dynamical" solution of the reflection equation has
been recently found, and it has been realized in the context of the sine-Gordon model.
It is a challenging problem to apply this "dynamical" solution to the  spin chain at roots of
unity, and investigate the thermodynamics and the scattering process in this framework.  We hope to
address these questions soon in a future
work.
