 The anomalous Ward identity is derived for  SUSY Yang-Mills 
theories
, which is resulted out of Wrapping of  branes on Supersymmetric two 
cycles.
From the Ward identity One obtains the Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde
equation and hence can solve for the pre-potential. This way one avoids 
the
problem of enhancon which maligns the non-perturbative behaviour of the 
Yang-Mills
theory resulted out of Wrapped branes.

1. Introduction 
Recently the gauge theory/gravity duality , which is commonly
known as Ads/CFT duality is extended to non-conformal pure
  or   supersymmetric Yang -Mills (SYM)
theories. So far the perturbative behaviour of the 
 SYM
is produced by this duality. The conventional folklore is that the
instantons which are responsible for the non-perturbative part of
the pre-potential are suppressed in the large N limit (since the
gauge gravity duality is valid only in the large N limit). Also the
non-perturbative strong coupling behaviour of SYM concerns the
dilaton which is plagued with
the  singularity of "enhancon". Here we establish the 
anomalous super conformal Ward identity for  SYM in the
gravity dual picture. Further the super conformal Ward identity is
written as  Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde (WDVV) equation
from which one can obtain the exact pre-potential.
 2. The Strategy 
We start with  type IIB little string theory e la' a collection of a
large number of  brane in the vanishing string coupling limit
which gives rise to  SYM. Then we dimensionally reduce
two of its spatial world volume in such a way that we retain 
SYM  in the low energy limit. The  brane has  R-symmetry
as the normal bundle. When one identifies the  subgroup of the
 R-symmetry with the  spin connection of the two cycle which
is compactified, one gets a covariant constant spinor and SUSY is
retained, which is commonly known as twisting.
This is called wrapping of  brane on a supersymmetric two cycles.
If the compact space is a two-sphere, then there will be no extra hyper-
multiplet and in the low energy limit i.e. in the scale much lower than
the radius of the sphere we will get pure    SYM.
Thus it
amounts to consider a gauged  supergravity solution and then lift
it to get the solutions in ten dimensions. We use here the results of
 classical solutions of  gauged supergravity
which is amenable to ten dimensional string theory.

f(x) = e ^x  ^2  _1 + e ^-x  ^2  _1,

gauged supergravity and  is a parameter as the integration constant
of the classical solution. For  the range of the radial
variable is  where  is the solution
for . Here  and  are the
angles of compact two-sphere with radius of compactification as

and ,  and 
are angles of transverse three-sphere.
The conservation of the RR-charge on
the transverse sphere  fixes 
for  number of  branes with string coupling .
The  brane action is given by
S = - _5 d^6  e ^-  
- ( G+ 2 F )  + _5
(_n C^(n) e ^2 F 
)
where F is the world volume gauge field and  is the brane
tension.
. The BPS condition is fixed from
the condition of the vanishing of the potential between two branes which
gives  to be . This condition makes the
transverse boundary of the D brane to be a two dimensional space
consisting  and  which will eventually the moduli space
of    SYM.

We want to establish here the anomalous super conformal Ward
identity.  In the presence of gravity the trace anomaly
 ^_= (g) g^3 (F^a_ )^2   +
c(g^2) 16 ^2  (W_ )^2   -
a(g^2) 16 ^2  (R _ )^2
where  is the beta function of SYM,  and  are central
functions near the criticality,  is the Weyl tensor
and  is the dual of the curvature tensor.
However this relation can be extracted from the two point functions of
the energy momentum tensors. In Ref., it is shown
how to extract these functions from the absorption cross-section
of soft dilatons or gravitons  by the  branes. The probability of
absorption is taken as
ratio of the flux  near  to the in coming flux at very large z .
This gives
= N^4 128 ^3 (z -z_0)^2  ^3.
where  is the frequency of the soft gluon. Here we see the
presence of  which if we write
as in Ref. 
we get a term  in the
cross-section signaling the asymptotic freedom or logarithmic coupling.
Also we see the presence of enhancon when  is zero. This gives
. Similarly one can also calculate
from  R-current the chiral anomaly.
Combining trace anomaly, chiral anomaly and supertrace anomaly one can
write the Ward identity as2 F  - F(A)  'A  = N 8^2 tr ^2,
where  is the effective potential or the pre-potential,
 is the chiral multiplet coupled to vector multiplet
in the    SYM and  is the anomaly multiplet
for example  will correspond to .
Here the bosonic component of   corresponds  to
 or in radial coordinate  . In
the broken phase
the branes will be distributed on a circle or  the eigen
values of  which are  matrices  will be distributed
on a circle. The
second part of eq.(8)
will read as .
 This
equation one can in principle solve in the large N limit and obtain the
exact pre-potential in this limit.
