Introduction  

 In recent years there have been much
effort  to analyze the different aspects of
two dimensional Yang-Mills (YM) theory [1-9]. The
YM  theory is defined by the Lagrangian 
 on a Riemann surface, where  is the field
strength  tensor. This theory is equivalent to the so-called 
-  theory, which characterized by the Lagrangian 
, such as invariance
  under area preserving diffeomorphisms and lack of any
propagating degrees of freedom b1 . These properties are also
shared by a large  class of theories, called the generalized two
dimensional  Yang-Mills (gYM's) theories. These theories,
however, are defined  by replacing  an arbitrary class function of
 instead  of tr e1 . Several aspect of this theories
such as, partition function, generating functional and large -N
limit  on an arbitrary two dimensional  orientable  and
non-orientable surfaces has been discussed in [16-22]. There is
another way to generalize YM and gYM and that is to use a
nonlocal action for the auxiliary field, leading to the so-called
nonlocal YM (nlYM) and nonlocal gYM(nlgYM)
theories, respectively kh1 .  Several aspects of nlYM
nlgYM, such as, classical behavior, wave function, partition
function, generating functional, and also large-  limit of it,
have been studied on orientable surfaces in [11-15]. In all of
these theories, the solution  appear as some infinite summations
over the irreducible representations of the gauge group. In the
large - N limit, however, these summations are replaced by
suitable path integrals over continuous parameters characterizing
the Young tableaux, and saddle-point analysis shows that the only
significant representation is the classical one, which minimizes
some effective action. This continuous parameters characterizing
the representation  is a constrained, as the length of the rows of
the Young tableau is non-increasing. So for small values of the
surface area, the classical solution satisfies the constraint; for
large values of the surface area, it dose not. Therefore  the
dominating representation is not  the one, which minimizes the
effective  action. This introduces a phase transition  between
these  two regime. Some problem has been studied for special cases
of YM[17, 23], gYM [20, 21, 22], nlYM[12, 14],
nlgYM in [13, 15] on sphere. In this  paper I investigate this
problem ( large-N limit)  of nlgYM theories on arbitrary
non-orientable surface.

The scheme of this paper is the following. In sect. 2, I briefly
review the large-N limit of nlgYM theories of  gauge
group on any arbitrary  non-orientable surface and obtain
effective action of theory at large-N limit. In sect. 3, I study
the phase structure of nlgYM for  model in all
order  on an arbitrary surface. In sect. 4,  I study the phase
structure of theory for 
models on any arbitrary non-orientable surface.


Preliminaries  

In kh1 , a non-local generalized two dimensional Yang-Mills
(nlgYM's) theories was defined as:

1 
 e^S:= DB   itr (BF) d+
[ (B) d]  ,
 where B is an auxiliary field at the adjoint representation of
gauge group, F is the field strength,    is a similarity-invariant
 function,  is the invariant measure of the surface;
  .
It was further shown that the partition
function for this theory on a closed non-orientable  manifold,
, with area ,  genus ,  copies of Klein bottle,
and  copies of projective plane (),  is given by the exact
formula kh1 ,kh2   as:
 2 
 Z__g,s,r  (A)= _R=R   d^2-(2g +2s +r)  [-A(R)] ,
 where  's label the irreducible representation of the gauge
group,  which the sum is only over self-conjugate representation,
and also  is:
 3 
  (R) =
_k=1 ^p_k N^k-1  C_k(R).  Here  is the k'th Casimir of gauge group, 's are
 arbitrary constant. The representation of the  gauge  group
 are labelled by  integers  satisfying  ()
 and it is found that:
4 
 d_R&=& _1 i j N  (1+n_i-n_j j-i ),

 C_k(R) &=& _i=1 ^N [(n_i+N-i)^k - (N-i)^k].
  One defines a function  by
 6 
 -N^2V[ A_k=1 ^p _k C_k (R)] 
  := [-A(R)],
where 7 
 C_k (R) = 1 N^k+1  _i=1 ^N (n_i+N-i)^k.
  At the large-N limit of the gauge group,
 I use the  following  definitions b3 
 
 where
9 
 0x:=i N 1  and  
n(x):=n_i N .
 Then, apart some unimportant
constant,  the partition function  takes the form:
 
where
 
and
 15 
   W[] := _k=1  (-1)^k _k ^k(x).
Note that the sum in (2)  is only over self-conjugate
representations, which  in (10) shows this constraint also. This
requirement in  means  that there is the additional
constraint   to the sum as:
 10 
 n_i = - n_N-i +1 .
  In the large-N limit, this implies that the continuum variables,
 , satisfy:
 11 
 (x) = -(1-x).
  So one can  define a new function such as:
(x)= cc 
(x)  0 x 1/2 

-(1-x)  1/2 x 1 .
Here the function  being defined on the interval [0,
1/2], in which . Then, by institute (15) in (11), it
is seen that these models have interesting solution,  only for
even values of  and therefore one can arrive at:
 
Introducing the density function as 
 do . Thereof  is an
even function of , thus  is even, then the
interval corresponding to values of  () is [].
 It is seen that the condition
 demands , and also
 16 
 _-a ^a  u(z) dz = 1.
  The saddle point that dominates this path integral is given by the
equation of motion. It is found that:
 17 
  h(z)& = &P_-a ^a 
  z u(z')dz' z^2 - z'^2 ,

&=&P_-a ^a  u(z')dz' z - z' ,
 where  indicates  the principal value of integral and
 19 
 h(z)&=& W'(z)

 &=& A 4(1-g-s-r/2) V' A _0^1/2 W[(x)]dx  , 

&=&A 4(1-g-s-r/2)  V' A _-a ^a W(z)u(z)dz .
  A part from some coefficient, this equation is the same as that
 obtained in kh1 , kh2  , which obtained for this theory on
 orientable surface, and can be solved in the same manner.  the
 density function, , found from (18) depend on the
 modified area  and  therefore  , in which as 
 increases, a situation is encountered where   exceeds 1. So
 the solution of (18) is  valid only for  less than  some
 critical value .  is the value of  at which the
 maximum of  becomes 1, . The region
  is called the weak coupling phase (WCP) regime  and the
 region  is called the strong coupling phase (SCP) regime.
 By the same procedure which used in k4 , I can expand the
 density  function in WCP regime, , around absolute
 maxima, , and it is found that for the points which are
 adjacent of critical point, , the difference of free
 energy in SCP and WCP regime is:
 20 
 F_s-F_w ^3,
    where
 the free energy of the theory is defined as:
  21 
 F := S__cla.  ,
  and
 22 
 = u_w(z_0) - 1.
  By considering  as a function of  and expand it around ,
 one can arrive at:
 23 
 (A) = +   where
 24 
 =(    ) _= _c 
 d dA _A=A_c .
 So for the case which 
and  are nonzero, we have
 25 
 F_s-F_w (A-A_c)^3 +     Here  is a constant which is independent of modified area
 of manifold,  (or ). Thus, almost all models which, the density
 function of that have some absolute maxima, and exist the proper
 quantity  in which, ,
 has a third order phase transition on any arbitrary non-orientable
 surface.

 models. 

In this case  is an even function of ,
 then we can use of (18). So by solving (17 ), it is found that:
26 
 u_w(z) =k a^2-z^2 _n=0 ^ 
 (2n-1)!! 2^nn! a_k^2n z^2k-2n-2 ,
where  is obtained from (16 ) as:
 27 
 a_k =[ 2^k(k-1)!! (2k-1)!! ] ^1 2k  .
 It has been shown that  (26 ) has three extremum points at   and
 Ali , in which  is
independent of  and is determined from
 28 
_n=0 ^k-2 (2n-1)!! 2^n+1 (n+1)! _k^-(n+1)  =
1. Using , (where 's are extremum points),
one can see:
 29 
u"_w(z_0) =-ka^2k-2 (2k-1) a^2-z_0^2  _n=0 ^k-2 
(2n-1)!!z_0^2k-2n-4  2^nn!a^2k-2n-4  .
  So when , then , so that for
 () models the density function  is minimum at
  but for  the density function is maximum
 only  for cases which  or
 30 
 1> g + s + r/2,
  therefore , we see that the density function of these theories is
 maxima at , when (30 ) has been satisfied.
By substitute (27 ) in (26 ), we obtain:
 31 
u_w (z_1,2 )=^1 2k  f(k)
 where  is independent of (or ). Using (24) and
(25), we have
 32 
  (A) =
 d dA ^1 2k   _A=A_c (A-A_c)
+ where, we use of . Thus if
 is nonzero, these
theories has a third order phase transition. Note that for the
case which , the relation (30 ) is satisfied and this
means that these theories has third order phase transition on
sphere, also if  and , the order of phase transition
of theory on projective plane (RP) is 3 for all order of
, but if  and  ,   the condition (30 )
is not satisfied, then the theory has no phase transition on Klien
bottle and other non-orientable surfaces.

the  models. 

I now consider  with arbitrary
. At the first I assume that  .
So by solving (17 ), one can obtain:
33 
u_w(z) =  4 a^2 - z^2 (4 + a^2 + 2z^2),
 and from (16 ),
 34 
a^2(8 +3a^2) = 16.
  The shape of  depends on .
   It is seen that
35 
 u"_w(0) = 4 (3a^2 -4).
    So for  ,   has only one extremum  point at
 , if , and also
 36 
 &= &d(u_w(0) -1) dA _A=A_c , 

 &=& 1 108 ^2   
 12/ _c + 1 + 48/ _c  - 1  1 + 48/_c  -1   .
 Thus,  the  density function is maximum at  ()
for the case which  (), and this is
satisfied only on sphere and projective plane. However the order
of phase transition of this model is three on sphere and
projective plain and on other orientable and non-orientable
surface has no phase transition. For   this
model has three extremum point at  and , where
37  z_0= 2 3 ( 1+
48   -2  ) . From this for the case
which , one can obtain that  is minimum at
 and has two maxima at . So by obtaining 
and use of (23-25) , one can arrive at:
 38  =
2 3  4_c + 3 
6^3/4 (_c +3)^1/4  d dA _A=A_c 
>0.
So according with (24 ) and (25 ), this theory has phase transition only
on S and RP and the order of it is 3.
For the case which (for all value of ),
 the density function  has
three extremum point at  and ,  where
39 
z_0 = 2 3 ( 2 + 1 +
3   )  .
It is clearly seen that this model of theory has phase transition
 on all surfaces which . Indeed, it  is not difficult to check
 that  is negative, and also, from (39 ), one can obtain
 , and then:
 40 
 d dA  _A=A_c & = & d dA (u_w(z_0) - 1)_A=A_c ,
 

 &=& 2 3 2 3   d dA _A=A_c ,
  so according with (24 ) and (25 ), it is found that if
  , then  the 
 model whit  has a third order phase
  transition on all closed orientable  and non-orientable
  manifold except on sphere, torus, projective plain and Klein bottle.

conclusion 

I study the large-N limit of  nlgYM theories on  arbitrary
non-orientable surface. By obtaining the effective action of these
theories at the large-N limit, it is shown that apart some
coefficient, the saddle point equation is the same as that obtain
for these theories on orientable surface. I study the phase
structure of
  model
 and it is seen that all order of this model has
 third order phase transition only on projective plane.
 Also, by considering   the 
 model of  nlgYM, I found that, for the
case , this theory has third order phase transition
on , and on other non-orientable  surface has no phase
transition, whereas for the case  this model has phase
transition on all closed non-orientable surfaces except projective
plane and Klein bottle, and the order of phase transition is 3. It
is clearly seen that all order of 
model on any arbitrary closed non-orientable surfaces has the same
phase structure of  model of nlYM.

Note that the whole reasoning is independent  of the number of
points
 as  attains its absolute maximum. It is clear that a similar
 situation prevails for the cases which  has many absolute
 maximum, and  also in this case, one can realize the WCP regime
 and obtain the phase structure of theory in the multi-critical
  points. It is remarkable that there might be cases which
    is zero (not negative). At this state the theory
   has phase transition, but the order of phase transition is not
   3.
