 The abelian form of the first class constraints of
SU(N) Yang-Mills theory in  is obtained explicitly.
Considering the abelian constraints, it is shown that Coulomb
gauge does not lead to Gribov copies. We also show that in the
strong coupling limit, the gauge symmetry of the theory is
similar to that of QED.

 It is well known that SU(N) Yang-Mills theory is a constraint
 system possessing non-abelian first class constraints ,
  ^0_a=. _a-gf_abc A _b.  _c0,a=1,,N^2-1,
   in which,  are the structure coefficients of SU(N) algebra,
 's are momenta conjugate to gauge fields 
's,
  A_a^i(x),_b^j(y)=_ab ^ij (x-y),i,j=1,2,3,
   and  is the coupling constant of the gauge field
 self interaction. The constraints 's () form a representation
 of SU(N) algebra, i.e.
  ^0_a ^g_1 ,^0_b ^g_2 =gf_abc ^0_c ^g_1g_2 ,
  where  and  are smooth real functions and .
 In 1978, Gribov showed that Coulomb gauge 
 is insufficient to fix the gauge freedom of the action generated by non-abelian constraints
 's ().
 He observed that for SU(2) Yang-Mills theory
 there exist at least two points on the gauge orbit that satisfy Coulomb
 gauge. This effect is in general called Gribov ambiguity
 and became a serious drawback for the quantization of Yang-Mills theory.
 There have been many attempts to remedy the Gribov ambiguities for example by
   
 considering proper gauge fixing condition like the axial gauge 
, 
 applying quantization approaches in which there is no need
 to do gauge fixing, 
 using the celebrated BRST-BFV approach where one considers
 BRS transformation instead of gauge transformation, 
 and/or applying stochastic quantization method, see for example
 reference. 
  It is well known that Gribov ambiguities can be resolved by perturbation. In what
 follows, we introduce an approach to remedy these ambiguities in SU(N)
 Yang-Mills theory which is valid in the strong coupling limit.
  It is proved that non-abelian constraints become abelian if one
 maps each constraint to the surface of the other ones
. To be explicit, consider two independent
 constraints  and  which satisfy the following algebra:
  ,=C+D,
   where  and  are some functions of phase space coordinates.
 One can show that the constraints  and
  are equivalent to  and  and commute with each
 other, i.e.
      The non-abelian constraints 's () can be made abelian in
 a similar way. Using the Helmholtz theorem in vector analysis,
 one can write the vector  as,
   _a(x)=-_y. _a(y) 4x- y +_y _a(y) 4 x-y ,
   up to some surface terms. Inserting  from
 Eq.() into Eq.(), one can obtain a set of new
 constraints, say 's, equivalent to 's (), defined as
 follows,
  ^1_a(x)=. _a-gf_abc A _b. _y _c(y) 4 x-y +g^2R^(2) _a(x),
  where,
  R^(2) _a(x)&=&1 g^2 (gf_abc A _b. _y. _c(y) 4x- y )

&=&f_abc f_cde A _b._yA _d. _e  4x-y .
  To obtain the second equality, we have considered 
 (). It is important to note that the constraints 's are equivalent
 to 's since,
  _a^1=^0_a+gf_abc A _b._y_c(y) 4x- y .
  As can be easily verified by direct calculation, one finds
 , as a result of the above
 mentioned theorem (see Eqs.(,)).
 Inserting  from  Eq.() into Eq.() and using Eq.() again,
 one obtains 's, a new set of constraints equivalent to
 's, which satisfy the following algebra,
   ^2_a,^2_b=O (g^3).
  At th step, one finds 's,
  ^N_a (x)=. _a (x)-gf_abc A _b.
 [(^N-1 _n=0 (-g)^n^(n) )^t]_a(x)-
 gf_abc A _b.((-g)^N^N)_c (x),
   where,
   ^t(x)=_x_y_y _a(y) 4 x-y .
   The operator  is defined by the relation,
   (_ab (x,y))_ij =f_acb  (_x1 4x- y )_i(A _c(y))_j,i,j=1,2,3.
   It is obvious that,
  ^2_ab (x,y)&=&_z_aa_1 (x,z)._a_1b (z,y)

 &=& f_ac_1a_1 f_a_1c_2b _z_x1 4x- z A _c_1 (z)._z1 4z- y A _c_2 (y),
  and
  (V )_a(x)=_y_ab (x,y).V _b(y),
  in which  is some vector field .
 The constraints 's are equivalent to 's because,
  ^N_a=^0_a+gf_abc A _b.(_n=0 ^N-1 (-g)^n^n  )_c,
  where,
   _a(x)=_y_a(y) 4 x-y .
  Since,
  ^N_a=^N_a_(^N_b=0) +O (g^N+1 ), ba,
  one verifies that , (see
 Eqs.(,)).
 To obtain the abelian constraints one should obtain
 's.
 Using Eq.() one verifies that,
  ^_a(x)&=&. _a(x)-gf_abc  A _b(x).[
 (_n=0 ^(-g)^n ^n)  ^t]_c(x)

 &=&. _a(x)-gf_abc  A _b(x).(1 1-g  ^t)_c(x),
   By construction, the constraints 's are equivalent  to
 's (see Eq.())
 and, as can be verified by direct calculation,  satisfy the algebra,
  ^_a,^_b=0.
  Consequently, the generator of gauge transformation is
  G__a(x)^_a(x),
  where  is some infinitesimal real smooth
 function. Since , one verifies
 that,
  _(.A _a(x))&=&. A _a(x),G_

 &=&.A _a(x),_y _a(y).  _a(y)

 &=&-^2_a(x).
   We conclude that Coulomb gauge intersects
 the gauge orbit only once as is the case in QED. Therefore,
 Coulomb gauge does not lead to Gribov copies.
  In the strong coupling limit, , the
 abelian constraints  become simply ,
 similar to QED. This result can be verified noting that from
 Eq.() we have,
  _g ^_a(x)=. _a(x)+f_abc  A _b(x).(1   ^t)_c(x),
  Defining , one can write 
. Using the identity  (see Eq.()) one
 obtains,
  .(V )_a&=&_x._y f_acb 
 (_x1 4x- y )A _c(y).V_b (y)

 &=&-f_acb  A _c(x).V_b (x)

 &=&0.
  Therefore the second term in Eq.() is vanishing and we
 have,
  _g ^_a(x)=. _a(x).
  Consequently,
  _g _A =,
  which is similar to the gauge symmetry of QED.   It is interesting
 to obtain  Ward identities corresponding to
 the gauge transformation generated by  (). To this aim, one
 should first add a
 proper combination of 's to the Hamiltonian  to make
 the Poisson bracket of  with 's
 vanishing. Since ,
 this can be achieved by mapping  to the
 surface of constraints 's. This may
 provide a useful method to study the strong coupling limit of
 the theory.
