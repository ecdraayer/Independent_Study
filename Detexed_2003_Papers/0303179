Introduction 

  
Operators intertwining representations of Lie groups play a very
important role both in mathematics and physics. To recall the
notions, consider a Lie group    and two representations
   of    acting in the representation spaces  ,
which may be Hilbert, Frechet, etc. An  intertwining
operator     for these two representations is a continuous
linear map
  :  C C',  :  f     j, 
 fC,  jC'   
such that 
 T(g)   =   T'(g)  , gG  
An important application of the intertwining operators is that
they produce canonically invariant equations. Indeed, in the
setting above the equation
  f   =   j   
is a  -invariant equation. These are very useful in the
applications, recall, e.g., the well known examples of Dirac,
Maxwell equations. The intertwining operators are also very
relevant for analyzing the structure of representations of Lie
groups, especially of semisimple (or reductive) Lie groups, cf.,
e.g., , , , . There are two types of intertwining
operators : integral and differential. For the integral
intertwining operators, which we shall not discuss here, we refer
to ,  for the mathematical side and to  for
explicit examples and applications. For the  we refer to
, , ; (for early examples and partial cases see, e.g.,
, , , , , , , , , , , ,
, ). 

  
In the present paper we discuss  multilinear    such
that:
 _k  :    f f  _k 
     j  , f C,  jC'  
 _k  
 T(g) T(g)  _k 
   =   T'(g)   _k , gG  
Clearly, for    ,  reduce to , , resp. 

Let us give an example of such operator for  . Let  
  and consider   - functions so that the
representation is acting as  :








where    is a parameter characterizing the
representation (for more details see Section 4). Consider now
the operator:
 _2( f )   =  f"' f'  -   (f")^2
  
where    are the first, second, third, resp.
derivatives of  . Let us denote the space of functions with
  as transformation rule by  . Then it is easy to
show that    has the following intertwining property:
 _2  :   f   f 
     j  , f ^0 ,   j ^8   
 _2   ( 
T^0(g) T^0(g) ) 
  =   T^8(g)   _2 , gG  

  
We would like to note that our problem is related to the problem
of finding invariant  -differentials. In the simple example
above such a relation is straightforward. Indeed an example of
invariant quadratic differential is the Schwarzian (cf., e.g.,
) :
 
&Sch  (f)      ( f"'f'   -   (f")^2
(f')^2  )  (dx)^2 &Sch  ( f f_0 
)   =   
Sch  (f(x))    f_0 , 
f_0(x)  =   x -- x  
&Sch  (f_0)   =   0 
   

Of course, such direct relations are an artifact of the
simplicity of the situation. Our setting is more general than the
problem of finding invariants as in  since it allows in
principle arbitrary representation parameters. Below we give such
operators for any semisimple Lie group.

For other examples of multilinear invariant operators see, e.g.,
, . These examples rely on adaptations of the classical
polynomial invariant theory of Weyl . Another approach is to
use invariant differentiation with respect to a Cartan connection
.

  
Our approach is different  from those just mentioned. It is
a natural generalization of the    procedure of . More
than that. The present paper contains  two   interrelated
developments.  First   we propose  new generalized
Verma modules . They are called   - Verma modules,
 , and coincide with the usual Verma modules for .
As a vector space a   - Verma module is isomorphic to the
symmetric tensor product of    copies of the universal
enveloping algebra  , where    is the subalgebra
of lowering generators in the standard triangular decomposition
of a simple Lie algebra  .
The  second   development is the proposal of a procedure for
the construction of  multilinear   for semisimple Lie
groups  . This procedure uses the   - Verma modules and
coincides for    with our procedure for the construction of
 linear   . For all    central role is played
by the singular vectors of the   - Verma modules. Explicit
formulae for series of such singular vectors are given for
arbitrary . Using these are given explicitly many new
examples of multilinear . In particular, for  
  are given explicitly all bilinear . Using the
latter, as an application are constructed  -differentials
for all  , the ordinary Schwarzian being the case
.


  
The organization of the paper is as follows. 

In Section 2 we first recall the usual Verma modules formulating
their reducibility conditions in a way suitable for our purposes.
Then we introduce the new generalization of the Verma modules,
which we call   - Verma modules, and we give some of their
general properties.

In Section 2 we consider the singular vectors of the -Verma
modules. Using the singular vectors we show that -Verma
modules are always reducible independently of the highest weight
in sharp contrast with the ordinary Verma modules (). We
also give many important explicit examples of singular vectors
for . For  bi-Verma (= 2-Verma) modules we give the
general explicit formula for a class of singular vectors, which
exhausts all possible cases for .

In Section 4 we first recall the procedure of  for the
construction of linear . Then we generalize this procedure
for the construction of  multilinear . This is a general
result which produces a multilinear  for every singular
vector of a   - Verma module, the procedure of  being
obtained for .

In Section 5 we study bilinear operators for 
mentioning also which which results are extendable to
. We give explicit formulae for all bilinear 
for  and , noting the difference
between the algebra and group invariants. We study in some detail
partial cases, in particular, an infinite hierarchy of even order
 producing -differentials for all , the
ordinary Schwarzian being the case . We also give many
examples for .

In Section 6 we give some examples which illustrate additional
new features of the multilinear  for  .

In the Appendix we have summarized the notions of tensor,
symmetric and universal enveloping algebras.

k - Verma modules 

  
Let    or  . Let    be a semisimple Lie
algebra over    or a split real semisimple Lie algebra
over  . Thus    has a triangular decomposition:
  , where    is a
Cartan subalgebra of  (the maximally non-compact Cartan
subalgebra for ),  , resp.,  , are the
positive, resp., negative root vector spaces of the root system
 , corresponding to the decomposition  
  into positive and negative roots. [For
 this decomposition is a partial case of a Bruhat
decomposition.] In particular, one has:  
. In our cases 
 , , and further
   will denote a vector spanning  .  Let
   be the system of simple roots of .   Let  
  denote the set of dominant weights, i.e.,
   iff   for all
.  Let    be the universal enveloping
algebra of    with unit vector denoted by  . (The
notions of tensor, symmetric and universal enveloping algebras
are recalled in Appendix A.)

Let us recall that a  Verma module     is defined as
the HWM over    with highest weight    and
highest weight vector  , induced from the
one-dimensional representation    of
  , where    is a Borel
subalgebra of  , such that:

 &X  v_0   =   0 , X^+ 
&H  v_0   =   (H) v_0, H    Thus one has:
 V^L   
U()_U() v_0    U(^-)v_0  
(isomorphisms between vector spaces). One considers    as a
left  -module (w.r.t. multiplication in ).

Verma modules are generically irreducible. A Verma module is
reducible iff it has singular vectors (one or more) . A
 singular vector   of a Verma module    is a vector
 , such that   
and :

& X  v_s   =   0 , X^+ 
&H  v_s   =   ((H) -(H)) v_s, ^+,  0,   
H    The space   is a submodule
of    isomorphic to the Verma module  
  where    is the highest weight
vector of  ; the isomorphism being realized by
 . Furthermore, there exists (at
least one) decomposition  
, , ; the latter 
statement in the case    means that  ,
, . For each such decomposition there
exists a composition of embeddings of the Verma modules  
  which thus form a nested sequence of
submodules, so that    is a submodule of  ,
,  . Each such submodule is
generated by a singular vector of weight  . The
singular vector of weight    is given by  :
 v_s   =   v_s^m    =   P ^m  
(X^-_1, , X^-_)v_0   where    is
a homogeneous polynomial in its variables of degrees ,
where    come from ,
  form the system of simple roots . The polynomial
   is unique up to a non-zero multiplicative
constant. From this follows that the singular vector of weight
   is given by:
 v_s   =   v_s^    =   P ^m_n_n    
P ^m_1_1   v_0  

Finally, we should mention that in this setting the highest
weight satisfies:
 (L+  ,  _1^) - m_1  =  (L+
)(H__1 ) - m_1  =  0  ,  
where    is half the sum of all positive roots,   
 for any ,    is the scalar
product in  ,    corresponds to   
under the isomorphism  . As a consequence one
has:
 (_i-1  +  ,  _i^)   =   m_i  ,   i=1,,n,
  _0 =,  _i = _i-1  - m_i_i  

One should note that the condition  is in fact necessary and
sufficient for the reducibility of a Verma module. Thus one may
say equivalently that the Verma module    is reducible iff
there exists a root    and    so that holds
 :
 (L+  ,  ^) - m  =  (L+
)(H_) - m  =  0  
We have chosen a different exposition here since in the
generalization of the Verma modules we introduce below we do not
rely on an analogue of  and reducibility is discussed via
singular vectors.

  
We introduce now a generalization of the Verma modules. Let
   be a natural number, let    be the tensor
product:
 _k()     T_k(U())   =  
 U() U()  _k  
and let    be the symmetric tensor product:
 _k()     S_k(U())   =  
T_k(U())/I_k(U())   Then arbitrary elements of
   shall be denoted as follows:

u   =    u_1 u_k   , 
u_j U() ,   
where    denotes the symmetric tensor product which
is preserved under arbitrary permutations  .

Definition:    A   k - Verma module    
is a highest weight module over    induced from the
one-dimensional representation of    (cf. ) so that:
 _kV^L     
_k()   v_0 
     _k(^-)   v_0 ,   _U()   
(isomorphisms between vector spaces).    is considered a
left  -module (w.r.t. multiplication in ).
Denoting arbitrary elements    of    consistently with
 :
 
v   =    u_1 u_k     v_0 , u_j U(^-)   
we define the action of  as follows: 

X  v   =   _j=1 ^k   u_1 X u_j
u_k     v_0 , XU() . 
 

Remark 1:    Clearly,  1 - Verma modules are usual Verma
modules.  Corollary:  (from the above definition)    Let
 ,  let    be from the PBW basis of ,
 let    be the (negative) weight of , i.e.,  
. Then we have: 
  
H  v  =&  _j=1 ^k   u_1 H u_j
u_k      v_0  ==&   _j=1 ^k   u_1 u_j u_k      ( H - _j(H) )   
v_0  ==&  ( k (H) - _j=1 ^k _j(H) )  v
 .   

  
We need some more notation to proceed further.  Let  
 of ways  can be presented as a sum of positive
roots . (In general, each root should be taken with its
multiplicity; however, in the cases here all multiplicities are
equal to 1.) By convention  .  Let  
,  factors.  Let
 , 
, and let  
.  Let    and let   
 of elements  
, such that  , each such
element being taken with multiplicity  .
 Clearly,  ,  , .
Finally we define:
 _k^+_>      
_k= (_1,,_k) _k ^+   
_1 _k   
where some ordering of  , (e.g., the lexicographical
one), is implemented.  Let    and let   
 of elements  
, such that  , each such element
being taken with multiplicity  .
 Clearly,  ,  , 
. Now one can prove the following:

Proposition 1:    Let  and let
 
_kV^_       v    _kV ^L   H v  = 
(k(H) - (H)) v   .  Then we have:




















 where in c  the ordering of the root system
inherited from the ordering of    is implemented.  Proof:    Completely analogous to the classical case 
. Singular vectors of k - Verma modules 

  
In contrast to the ordinary Verma modules (), the  -
Verma modules for   are reducible independently of the
highest weight, which is natural taking into account their tensor
product character. This we show by exhibiting singular vectors
for arbitrary highest weights.

We call a  singular vector   of a  - Verma module
   a vector  , such that  
  and :



 i.e.,    is homogeneous:  
  for some . For   
coincide with .

The space    is a submodule of   
isomorphic to the Verma module  
  where    is the highest weight
vector of  ; the isomorphism being realized by
 
. 

In the next two Subsections we show some explicit examples for
the cases  .

  
We consider now the case    i.e.,  bi-Verma  (=
2-Verma) modules. We take a weight  , where
   and    is any simple root. We have
 , where  is the biggest
integer not exceeding . The possible singular vectors have the
following form:

_2v_s^n    =   _j=0 ^[n/2]   
^_nj    ( X^-_)^n-j 
  ( X^-_)^j 
   v_0  
The coefficients    are determined form the condition
a  with     all other cases of   are
fulfilled automatically. Thus we have:

Proposition 2:    
The singular vectors of the   bi-Verma (= 2-Verma) module
   of weight  , where    and
   is any simple root, are given by formula 
with the coefficients    given explicitly by:
 
&^_nj    =   _0  (n,(H))  (-1)^j  (2-_j,n/2 )   n
j    ((H) +1-n+j)  ((H) +1-j) ((H) +1-n)  ((H) +1-[n/2])   &
&(n,(H))   =    1, &  for    even and arbitrary
  1, &  for    odd,  
 0, &  for    odd,  
  
   
and  is an arbitrary non-zero constant.  Proof:   
By direct verification.  We give the lowest cases of the above general formula for
illustration (fixing the overall constant  appropriately) ;


















Proposition 2 confirms that  bi-Verma  modules are always
reducible since they possess singular vectors independently of
. In fact, they have an infinite number of singular vectors
of weights   , for any even positive integer    and any
simple root   .  Noreover, they possess singular vectors of
other weights, also independent of . For example we consider
weights  , where    is a
positive root, and    are two simple roots,
e.g., of equal minimal length (for simplicity). Then there exist
singular vectors of these weights given by, e.g.:

 
_2v_s^    =&    _1   X^-_1   X^-_2    1_u  - 
_2    X^-_2   X^-_1    1_u  -&- 
( _1 + _2 +1 )  
X^-_1    X^-_2
   v_0  , L_a  &  (H_a)  ,    a=1,2 
   









 where for the two solutions (present
in this case) the coefficients are: 











 
















Furthermore, the structure of the Verma modules is additionally
complicated since there is no factorization of the singular
vectors as for , cf. . For the latter consider the
weight  ,  with    as
in the previous example. Then there exists a singular vector of
this weight given by:

 
_2v_s^_0    =&    ( 2_1 _2 + _1 - _2 -1
)   ( X^-_1 )^2   X^-_2    1_u  -  2
_1 _2   X^-_1   X^-_2   X^-_1

Here we consider the case . i.e.,  tri-Verma  (=
3-Verma) modules over arbitrary  . Consider a weight  
, where    and    is any simple
root. We first note the dimension of the weight space:
 
  _3V ^_n    =   (n -3 [])  
(1 + [] ) 
 +  _,[]    The possible singular vectors
have the following form:

_3v_s^n    =   _ j,k _+ n-j-k j k   
^_njk    ( X^-_)^n-j-k 
  ( X^-_)^j    ( X^-_)^k 
   v_0   
The coefficients    are determined form the
condition a  with    - all other cases in of
  are fulfilled automatically. We give now the singular
vectors for    denoting   :







 














 




















 


































We give those examples in order to point out some new features
appearing for  tri-Verma modules in comparison with the  bi-Verma
modules:   Independently of    there exists
a singular vector at  any level   , except the lowest
, while for  bi-Verma modules singular vectors at  odd   levels exist only for special values of  ;
  
There exists  more than one singular vector   at any fixed
level    for    and arbitrary  . For
special values of    there exists a second singular vector
for  .  

Similar facts hold for   - Verma modules for . These
questions will be considered in another publication. In the
present paper we would like to demonstrate on examples the
usefulness of these modules, which we do in the next Sections.

Multilinear   

  
We start here by sketching the procedure of  for
construction of  linear   which we generalize in the
next subsection for  multilinear  . Let    be a
semisimple Lie group and let    denote its Lie algebra.
(Note that the procedure works in the same way for a reductive
Lie group, since only its semisimple subgroup is essential for
the construction of the . We restrict to semisimple groups
for simplicity. For more technical simplicity one may assume that
in addition    is linear and connected.) Let   
be an Iwasawa decomposition of , where    is the maximal
compact subgroup of ,    is abelian simply connected, the
so-called vector subgroup of  ,    is a nilpotent simply
connected subgroup of    preserved by the action of  .
Further, let  be the centralizer of  in . (
has the structure , where  is a finite
group,  is reductive with the same Lie algebra as .)
Then    is called a  minimal parabolic
subgroup   of . A  parabolic subgroup   of    is any
subgroup which is isomorphic to a subgroup    such
that:  ,  ,  
,  .   [Note that in the above considerations
every subgroup    may be exchanged with its Cartan conjugate
 .]   The number of non-conjugate parabolic subgroups
(counting also the case  ) is  ,  
.

Parabolic subgroups are important because the representations
induced from them generate all admissible irreducible
representations of  , . In fact, for this it is enough
to use only the so-called  cuspidal   parabolic subgroups,
singled out by the condition that  rank rank;
thus  has discrete series representations.

Let    be a cuspidal parabolic subgroup and let    fix a
discrete series representation    of    on the Hilbert
space    or the so-called limit of a discrete series
representation (cf. ). Let    be a (non-unitary)
character of , , where    is the Lie algebra
of . We call the induced representation 
Ind an  elementary
representation  of . (These are called generalized
principal series representations  (or limits thereof) in .)
Consider now the space of functions

_  =    C^(G,V_)    
(gman)  =  e^(H)  D^(m^-1 ) (g)    
where  , , , , .
 The special property of the functions of  is called  right covariance   (or equivariance ). It is well known
that    can be thought of as the space of smooth
sections of the homogeneous vector bundle (called also vector
 -bundle) with base space    and fibre  , (which
is an associated bundle to the principal  -bundle with total
space  ).

Then the elementary representation (ER)    acts in
 , as the left regular representation (LRR), by:
 (^(g)) (g')  =  (g^-1 g')  , g,g'G   (In practice, the same induction is used with
non-discrete series representations of  and also with
non-cuspidal parabolic subgroups.) One can introduce in
   a Frechet space topology or complete it to a
Hilbert space (cf. ). The ERs differ from the LRR (which is
highly reducible) by the specific representation spaces
. In contrast, the ERs are generically irreducible. The
reducible ERs form a measure zero set in the space of the
representation parameters , . (Reducibility here is
topological in the sense that there exist nontrivial (closed)
invariant subspace.) Next we note that in order to obtain the
 one may consider the infinitesimal version of ,
namely:
 (^(X) ) (g)      ddt  ((-tX)g)_t=0   , X 

The feature of the ERs which makes them important for our
considerations in  and here is a highest weight module
structure associated with them. [It would be lowest weight
module structure, if one exchanges    with  , as is
actually done in .] Let    if  is complex or
real split, otherwise let    be the complexification of
 with triangular decomposition:  
 .   Further introduce the right action of   
by the standard formula:
 (X ) (g)   =   ddt  (g(tX))_t=0    
where, ,  ,  , which is
defined first for  and then is extended to    by
linearity. Note that this action takes    out of   
for some  but that is exactly why it is used for the
construction of the .

We illustrate the highest weight module structure in the case of
the minimal parabolic subgroup. In that case  is compact
and  is finite dimensional. Consider first the case when
 is non-abelian. Let    be the highest weight vector
of . Now we can introduce  -valued realization
   of the space  by the formula:
 (g)       v_0  ,  (g)    
where    is the -invariant scalar product in
. On these functions the counterpart    of the LRR
, its infinitesimal form  and the right action of
   are defined as inherited from the functions  :




 In the geometric
language we have replaced the homogeneous vector bundle with base
space    and fibre    with a line bundle again with
base space   (also associated to the principal  -bundle
with total space  ). The functions    can be thought of
as smooth sections of this line bundle.   If  is abelian or
discrete then  is one-dimensional and    coincides
with  ; so we set  . Part of the main result
of  is:


Proposition:    The functions of the  -valued
realization    of the ER    satisfy :



 where  is built
canonically from  and contains all the information from
, except about the character  of the finite group
).   Now we note that conditions   are the defining conditions
for the highest weight vector of a highest weight module (HWM)
over  with highest weight , in particular, of a Verma
module with this highest weight, cf. .

Let the signature    of an ER be such that the
corresponding    satisfies  for some
   and some  . If  is a real root, then
some conditions are imposed on the character  representing
the finite group  . Then there exists a   :


 
where    is uniquely determined so that  
.

The important fact is that   is explicitly given by  :
 ^m   (g)   =   
P^m  (X^-_1,, X^-_)  (g)   where
   is the same polynomial as in  and 
denotes the action b . One important technical
simplification is that the   are  scalar 
operators since they intertwine two  line  bundles
 , .

  
Now we generalize the above sketched construction of  to
 multilinear  . We have the following.

Proposition 3:    Let the signature    of an ER
be such that the   - Verma module    with highest
weight  ,   has a singular vector  
, i.e.,   is satisfied for some
 . Let us denote:
 _kv^_s   =   _k^  v_0  
where    is some concrete polynomial
as in c . Then there exists a multilinear  which we
denote by    such that:
 _k^_  :     _k 
      , ,    
 _k^_   _j=1 ^k 
 1_u ^(X) 
1_u  _k 
  =   ^(X)    _k ^_ , X 
where    is uniquely determined (up to the representation
parameters of the discrete subgroup ) so that  
. The operator is given explicitly by
the same polynomial as in , i.e.,
 _k^_ ( 
  _k )   =  
_k^    ( 
 _k )  
where the hat on    symbolizes the right action
b , the explicit action of a typical term of
   being (cf. c ) : 
  
&
 X^-_^1_1  X^-_^1_n_1     
   
X^-_^k_1  X^-_^k_n_k       
  _k   =&=  
( X^-_^1_1  X^-_^1_n_1   ) 
   ( X^-_^k_1  X^-_^k_n_k   )    Proof:    Completely
analogous to the case  (cf. ).  Remark 2:    The analog of the intertwining property 
on the group level, i.e.,
 _k^_  
 (g) (g)  _k 
  =   (g)    _k ^_ , gG  
will hold, in general, for less values of    than .
This in sharp contrast with the    case, where there is no
difference in this respect. An additional feature on the group
level common for all    is that some discrete
representation parameters of  , not represented in  ,
get fixed.  Remark 3:     Let us stress that since we have realized
arbitrary representations in the spaces of scalar-valued
functions    then also the  are  scalar  
operators in all cases  geometrically speaking, these
operators intertwine (tensor products of) line bundles. This
simplicity may be contrasted with the proliferation of tensor
indices in the approaches relying on Weyl's  polynomial
invariant theory , cf., e.g., , , where  
,  ,  .  

Finally we should mention that the simplest formulae are obtained
of one restricts the functions to the conjugate to  subgroup
    :
 C_       =  R    
,    (R ) ()   ()
,       
Clearly, the elements of    and consequently    are
almost determined by their values on  because of right
covariance  and because, up to a finite number of
submanifolds of strictly lower dimension, every element of 
belongs to  . The latter are open dense submanifolds of
   of the same dimension forming non-global Bruhat
decompositions of . Connectedly,    is an open dense
submanifold of  .

The ER    acts in this space by:
  &( T^(g) ) ()
  =   e^(H)    D^(m^-1 )  (& D^(m)  ()   =   D^(m)  ()   =   
 v_0  ,   D^(m)  ()     
where  ,  ,   ,
 , and we have used the Bruhat
decomposition  , (). [The
transformation can also be defined separately for  
  and there exists smooth passage from  to
these expressions. This is related to the passage between
different coordinate patches of  .] One may easily check
that the restriction operator    intertwines the two
representations, i.e.
 T^(g)   R   =   R   (g) , 
gG 

Bilinear operators for SL(n,R) and SL(n,C)  

  
In the present Section we restrict ourselves to the case  
, mentioning also which results are extendable to
. We use the following matrix representations for
, its Lie algebra  and some subgroups and subalgebras:































Since the algebra  is maximally split then the Bruhat
decomposition with the minimal parabolic:
   =   sl(n,)   =   _0   _0    _0   
may be viewed as a restriction from  to  of the
triangular decomposition of its complexification:
 ^  =   sl(n,)   =   ^_+      ^_-   
Accordingly, we may use for both cases the same Chevalley basis
consisting of the  generators , , 
given explicitly by:
 X^+_i  =  E_i,i+1   , X^-_i  =  E_i+1,i  ,
H_i  =  E_ii  - E_i+1,i+1   , i = 1,...,n-1  
where  are the standard matrices with 1 on the
intersection of the -th row and -th column and zeroes
everywhere else. Note that , , , resp.,
generate , , , resp., over  and
, , , resp., over .

  
We consider induction from the minimal parabolic case, i.e., 
. The characters of the discrete group   
are labelled by the signature:  
,   : 
 ch _(m)   =   
ch _( _1,_2,...,_n )
      _k=1 ^n-1   (_k)^_k   , 
mM_0  
The (nonunitary) characters    of    are
labelled by  , , which is the value of
   on  diag,
(with the unity on -th place), , i.e.,
  :
  ch _c(a)   =&   ch _c (_k t_kH_k )      _k t_k (H_k)   =  
_k t_kc_k   =   _k _k^c_k  a   =&   _k
a_k  A-0  , a_k  =  t_k H_k  A_0  , t_k, _k = t_k    

Thus, the right covariance property  is:
 (gman)   =   _k=1 ^n-1   (_k)^_k   
_k^c_k   (g)   and in this case we have scalar functions,
i.e.,    because    is discrete. Thus, the ER
acts on the restricted functions as (cf. ):
( T^c, (g) ) ()
  =   _k=1 ^n-1   (_k)^_k   _k^c_k 
 (  (note that ). The functions
 depend on the  nontrivial elements of the
matrices of . For further use those will be denoted by
, i.e., for  we have  with
 for , cf. j .

The correspondence between the ER with signature  
  and the highest weight   ,   used in the general
construction of the previous Section, here is very simple :
 , so that  . Further, we recall
that the root system of  is given by roots:
 , , so that 
 for  and 
, where , , are the simple roots with
non-zero scalar products:  ,
 , then  
. Then we use .

We need also the infinitesimal version of :
 ^c(Y)  ()     
( ddt  ( T^c, (tY)  ) ()
)__t=0    , Y  
which we give for the Chevalley generators  explicitly:









 where   ,  
 , and we are using the
convention that when the lower summation limit is bigger than the
higher summation limit than the sum is zero.

We also need the right action  for the lowering generators
which on the restricted functions is given explicitly by:
 X ^-_i ()   =   ( D^i+1 _i  + 
_k=i+2 ^n  z^k _i+1  D^k _i )  ()  

Naturally the signature    representing the discrete
subgroup    is not present in  , . Thus,
formulae  , are valid also for the holomorphic ERs of
.

Now to obtain explicit examples of multilinear  it remains
to substitute formula  in the corresponding formulae for
the singular vectors of the k-Verma modules. We note that often a
singular vector will produce many . For example each formula
valid for any simple root will produce  formula, each
formula valid for roots as  will produce 
formulae for each . To save space we shall not
write these formulae except in a few examples in the cases 
and .

 
Now we restrict ourselves to the case  . We
denote:  ,  ,  ,  
,  . We start with  bilinear   ,
. We combine Propositions 2  3. For   
Proposition 2 gives  all singular vectors   of bi-Verma
modules since all weights in    are of the form  
, . Thus we have:

Theorem 1:    All bilinear  for the case of  
  are given by the formula:
 _2^_n  ( )   =  
_j=0 ^[n/2]   ^_nj   ^(n-j)   ^(j)    where
 ,  
, and the coefficients    are given in
Proposition 2. The intertwining property is: 
  &_2^_n    
( ^c (X) 1_u  +  1_u ^c (X) )
  =   ^c'  (X)    _2 ^_n   , X&c  =  -(H), c'  =  2(c+n)    
Proof:    Elementary combination of Propositions 2  3 in
the present setting. In particular,  ,  
. As we mentioned, the corresponding intertwining property on the
group level is restricting the values of    and, as for
, of some discrete parameters not represented in  . In
the present case we have:

Theorem 2:    All bilinear  for the case of  
 are given by formulae  and  with
'integer' highest weight:  . The
intertwining property is: 
  &_2^_n     ( T^c, 
(g) T^c,  (g) )   =   T^c',(g)    _2 ^_n  , gG &c  =  -(H)  = 
-p, c'  =  2(c+n)  =  2(n-p) ,
 =   =  p(mod  2) 
   
Proof:    Follows by using Theorem 1 and checking  for
 
which sends    into   
Thus, the signatures of the two intertwined spaces coincide and
are determined by the parameter  .

Next we consider the example of  invariant   functions
, i.e., functions for which the transformation law 
has no multipliers - this happens iff  . For
these functions the bilinear  are given by the special case
of Theorem 2 when  , which by  further
restricts    to be even or  . Formula  with 
substituted simplifies to:
 _2^0_n  ( )   =  
_j=1 ^n/2    (-1)^j-1   (1-_j,n2  )   n-j
n(n-1)    n j    n-1 j-1   
^(n-j)   ^(j)  , n2  
 _2^0_  ( )   =     _x
  =      and in addition we have fixed the
constant    for later convenience. Let us write out the
first several cases of  :




 where
(standardly)  ,  
,  
. Note that b  (i.e.,  for  )
was already given in . We give now two important technical
statements.

Lemma 1:     For    the (formal) substitution
   in the 
 gives zero: 
 _2^0_n  ( _0 )   =   0 , _0(x)     x -- x 
, n 2 + 2  
Proof:    By direct substitution. In the calculations one
uses the fact:
 _x^m    x -- x 
  =    (-1)^m   m!   ^m-1  (- x)^m+1   
, m 
After the substitution of  in  the resulting
expression is proportional to    which is zero
for  ; (the latter making clear why the Lemma is not valid
for ). Lemma 2:     Let   Diff, the group
of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of the circle  
. Then we have: 









 Proof:    For   and a,b  this is just
substitution. Further we note that:
_2^0_n  ( _0 )
  =   (   _2 ^0_n  ( ), _0(x)  =   x -- x    is
just the intertwining property of    and then
c  follows because of Lemma 1. Remark 4:    We give an example from the last Lemma:
  P_6(,)   =&  
10   ( )^2  ( 3    -  4
 ( )^2 )  _2 ^0_4  ( )  -&-  5    ( ^(4)    (
 -  6     +  6  (
)    Using  it is straightforward
to show  . In fact, the first term in
 vanishes for    because of . The
vanishing of the second term in  prompts us that the
trilinear expression in    is also a . This is indeed
so, cf. the last Section for some more examples for trilinear
operators.  We can introduce now a hierarchy of    invariant
 -differentials for every   :





 where the property b  is just a
restatement of  for  and   for . The usual
Schwarzian  Sch  is one of these objects (cf. ). It has
an additional property :
 Sch _4 ( )   =   Sch _4 ()     +  Sch _4
() , , Diff _0S^1  
showing that it is a 1-cocycle on Diff , .

Remark 5:    One may consider also  half-differentials   and using a  and  write:
 Sch _1 ()      _2 ^0_  (
)  
(  dx )^1/2    =  
  ( dx )^1/2    =  
  ( d )^1/2    Property b  then
follows from  .  Finally, we just mention the case when the resulting functions
are invariant:      . This is only possible
when    is even, cf. . Formula  with 
substituted simplifies considerably:
  _2^-n _n  ( ) 
  =&   _j=0 ^n/2    (-1)^j  (1-_j,n/2 )   
^(n-j)   ^(j)   ==&   ^(n)    - 
^(n-1)    +  ^(n-2)    -&- 
^(n-3)    + +   (-1)^n/2   (
^(n/2)  )^2 , n2  
and we have fixed the constant    appropriately. 

 
Now we consider to the case  . We denote:
 ,  ,  . The right action is (
) :
 X ^-_1   =   ( _x  +  y_z
)   , X ^-_2 
   =   _y  , X ^-_3   =   _z   and we have given it also for the nonsimple root vector 
.

The bilinear operator correponding to  is:
  _2^3^_  ()   =&    (
(_1 -_2)  ( _xy   +  y _yz  ) 
 -  _2  _z )   -&-  ( _1 + _2 +1 ) _y
(_x  +  y_z)    where , 
, etc. The two bilinear operators
correponding to   are given by:
  _2^3^_2  ()  =&  (a_1  + a_2 
+ 2a_3)   _zz   +  (a_2  + 2a_3)  
_xyz   +  (a_2  + 4a_3) y   _yzz   +&+ 
a_3   ( _xxyy   + y
 _xyyz   + y^2  _yyzz  )  + 
&+  (b_1  +  2c_1) _y   ( _xz   + y
_zz  )  +  ( b_2 +  2c_2)
 ( _x   + y _z  )  _yz  
 + &+  c_1  _y   ( _xxy   + 2y
_xyz   + y^2 _yzz  )  +&+  c_2  (
_x   + y _z  ) 
( _xyy   + y _yyz  ) 
 + &+  (d_1 +  d_2  +  d_3)  ^2_z  
 +  ( d_2 +  2d_3)  _z  
 ( _xy   + y _yz  ) 
 + &+  d_3  ( _xy   + y _yz  )^2  + 
d_4  ^2_y 
 ( _x   + y _z  )^2 
    
with constants as given in b,c .

The intertwining property is:
 _2^3^_n    
( ^c (X) 1_u  +  1_u ^c (X) )
  =   ^c'  (X)    _2^3 ^_n   , X 
where  ,  ,  

,  , since .

The case of invariant functions, i.e.,  gives a
trivial (zero) operator , while for  we have (up to
scalar multiple):
 _2^3^0_  ()   =   _y (_x  + 
y_z)   

In the case of invariant resulting functions, i.e.,
,  ,  , we have from
:
 _2^3^/2 _  ()   =   
  _z  +  2 _y (_x  +  y_z)  
while from  we have two operators corresponding to the two
solutions given by b,c , resp.:















Examples with  k    3 

We return now to the    setting to give examples of
trilinear  using the singular vectors of  tri-Verma modules
above. The trilinear  for the case of  
  are given by the formula:
 _3^_n  ( )   =   _ j,k
_+ n-j-k j k     
^_njk   ^(n-j-k)   ^(j)   ^(k)    
where the coefficients    are given from the
expressions for the corresponding singular vectors of  tri-Verma
modules, e.g., those given in the previous subsection.

If we pass to the group level then the possible weights are
restricted to be 'integer' (as in Theorem 2) :  
  and the corresponding intertwining property
is :
  &_3^_n     ( T^c, 
(g) T^c,  (g) T^c,  (g) )   =  
T^c',(g)    _3 ^_n 
, gG &c  =  -(H)  =  -p, c'  =  3(c+n)  =  3(n-p) ,
 =   =  p(mod  2) 
    

Next we restrict to the example of  invariant   functions
, i.e.,  . The trilinear  obtained
from the singular vectors in   are:













We recall that the operator in f  has appeared in . 

Analogously to Lemma 1 we note that for    the (formal)
substitution    in
the    gives zero:
 _3^0_n  ( _0 )   =   0 , _0(x)     x -- x 
, n >3  
which because of the factorization follows from Lemma 1 except
for f .

Analogously to Lemma 2 for   Diff  one can
check for the examples in   :













Consider now the case of resulting invariant functions, i.e.,
 , i.e.,  . There is no operator
for , while for  we get from  :

 

 





 


 





We see that at lower levels there occur many factorizations and
trilinear operators are actually determined by bilinear ones. We
illustrate this by two statements for arbitrary  k-Verma modules
and the corresponding multilinear .

Proposition 4:    The singular vectors of the  k-Verma
modules   of level    with  , ,
  ,  in the case   are given by:  
 _kv_s^n    =   _0 
 X^-_       X^-_ _n  
  1_u        1_u _k-n 
   v_0 , 1 n k, (H_) = 0 
Proof:    By direct verification. 
Proposition 5:    The    multilinear 
with the property:

partial cases of .

A Tensor, symmetric and universal enveloping algebras 

Let    be a vector space over  . The tensor algebra 
   over    is defined as the free algebra generated by
the unit element. We have  T(E)  = 
 ^_k=0  T_k(E) , T_k(E)
   EE _k , T_0(E)
 =  F.1  .   The elements    are called covariant
tensors of rank 
 t  =  t^i_1i_k  e_i_1 e_i_k   
where  ,    is a basis of  ,  
. (The rank of a covariant tensor does not depend on
the choice of basis of .) The tensor    is called symmetric
tensor if    is symmetric in all indices. Let
us denote
 S(E)  =   ^_k=0  S_k(E)  
where    is the subspace of all symmetric tensors of rank
. Note that if , then:
 S_k(E)  =  (n+k-1k )  

Let  , resp., ,   be the two-sided ideal of
 , resp., ,   generated by all elements of the type
 . Then we have
 T(E)  =  S(E)I(E)  , S(E)   T(E)/I(E)
 , S_k(E)   T_k(E)/I_k(E)  

Consider now a Lie algebra  . The universal enveloping
algebra    of    is defined as the associative
algebra with generators  , where    forms a basis of
   and the relations
 e_ie_j - e_je_i  =  _k c^k_ij e_k
   [e_i, e_j]   hold, where    are the structure
constants of  . Equivalently  ,
where    is the tensor algebra over  ,    is
the ideal generated by the elements  
. Since  
  and    are isomorphic,
then also    as vector spaces. This is the
content of the Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt (PBW) theorem.

Further in the case of    we shall omit the 
signs in the expressions for its elements. With this convention
as a consequence of the PBW theorem    has the following
basis:
e_0 = 1,   e_i_1i_k  = e_i_1  
e_i_k ,   i_1i_k   
where we are assuming some ordering of the basis of , e.g.,
the lexicographic one.

Finally we recall that    and    are completely
determined from the following commutation relations:


 and Serre relations:


 where
  rank   are the
Chevalley generators of  , (corresponding to the simple
roots  ),   
is the Cartan matrix of  , and    is
normalized so that for the short roots    we have  
.

Note Added  


This note should be read after Remark 4. 
It was published first in our paper:
  Phys. Atom. Nucl. 61  (1998) 1735-1742.

Let us introduce the following notation:
Sch _n ()     12    _2 ^0_n ()   .  
It is well known (cf., e.g., ) that the famous KdV equation may
be rewritten in the Krichever-Novikov form: 
_t f + Sch _4 (f) f'  =   0,
f = f(t,x)  ,  
noting that  is the Schwarz
derivative , cf. . To pass to the standard KdV form:
_t u +  u"' -  6uu'  =   0  ,  
one uses the substitution  
, . Motivated by the above we make the  Conjecture   
that the following equations:
_t f + Sch _n (f) f'  =   0 
 ,n2+2  ,  
are integrable (true for ). It may happen (if the
conjecture is true) that this hierarchy of equations coincides
with the KdV one. Then formulae ,  and  would
give an explicit expression for the whole KdV hierarchy in the
Krichever-Novikov form.

The present paper contains two interrelated developments.
First, are proposed new generalized Verma modules. They
are called k-Verma modules, kN, and coincide with
the usual Verma modules for k=1. As a vector space a k-Verma 
module is isomorphic to the symmetric tensor product of
k copies of the universal enveloping algebra U(g^-),
where  g^-  is the subalgebra of lowering generators in the
standard triangular decomposition of a simple Lie algebra  
g = g^+ h g^- . The  second 
development is the proposal of a procedure for the construction
of  multilinear intertwining differential operators for semisimple 
Lie groups  G . This
procedure uses  k-Verma modules and coincides for k=1
with a procedure for the construction of linear
intertwining differential operators. For
all  k  central role is played by the singular vectors of the
k-Verma modules. Explicit formulae for series of such
singular vectors are given. Using these are given explicitly many
new examples of multilinear intertwining differential operators. 
In particular, for  G = SL(2,R)  are given explicitly all bilinear 
intertwining differential operators. Using the
latter, as an application are constructed  (n/2)-differentials
for all  n2N, the ordinary Schwarzian being the case
n=4. As another application, in a Note Added we propose a new 
hierarchy of nonlinear equations, the lowest member being the 
KdV equation.
