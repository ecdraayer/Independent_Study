Introduction 

Pseudo-classical mechanics models, with anticommuting variables, have
found various applications. One class of applications is to the
pseudo-classical description of spin. Consider the 'free-fermion'
Lagrangian
lag1 
L = ifor  complex anticommuting variables  and their complex
conjugates  ( is a real, positive, dimensionless
coupling constant).
This Lagrangian has an obvious  invariance
but it is also invariant under the larger group . In a (coherent
state) basis for which the quantum operators corresponding to the
variables  are diagonal, with eigenvalues , the
Hilbert space of the quantum theory is spanned by anti-holomorphic
functions . This space has dimension  and
carries a spinor representation of .

The above Lagrangian is also invariant, although less obviously, under the
following non-linear, and non-analytic, transformations
susy1 
_^i = [1+ ]^12  
^i +  (+
)2 [1+ ]^12  
^i
where  are constant anticommuting parameters.
These transformations close on those of  to form the
superalgebra . In other words, the above free-fermion Lagrangian
provides a non-linear realization of the supergroup , with
 parametrizing the Grassmann-odd coset .

The full symmetry group is actually much larger than either  or
; it is the supergroup of supersymplectic diffeomorphisms of a
superspace of real dimension , which is generated by all 
functions on the Grassmann-odd phase-space. An alternative
characterization of it is as the closure of its two subgroups 
and . Both subgroups contain , which acts in an
obvious way on quantum wave-functions, so the Hilbert space decomposes
into representations of . In the standard quantum theory these
representations combine to yield the spinor of  and the Hilbert
space norm is the standard scalar product of two spinors.

However, one could attempt to combine the  representations into
representations of  rather than . In this case, the
'Hilbert' space would be a vector superspace of
dimension  rather than a vector space of dimension
, so this quantization of the free-fermion model would be very
different from the standard one; a motivation for
considering this possibility is that the  'Hilbert' space would
then carry a representation of the Euclidean BRST group 
 (see e.g.).

We shall show here that this
non-standard quantization can be implemented, but the result depends on
the resolution of an operator ordering ambiguity which leads to an
ambiguity in the definition of the  charge or, equivalently, the
assignment of  charge to the wave-function. There is a 'natural'
choice, for which the  charge is the direct quantum analog of the
 Noether charge of the Lagrangian () but, for
completeness, we consider other choices too. In many cases the
'Hilbert' space has zero norm states so the physical states in 'Hilbert'
space should be taken to be the equivalence classes of states with
non-zero norm  modulo the addition of zero norm states. The 
representation content of the physical 'Hilbert' space depends on the
 charge assigned to the wave-function. For the 'natural'
resolution of the operator ordering, and ,
we find that the physical Hilbert space is an  singlet!

Presumably, these results could be derived by a direct attempt to
implement the  symmetry on the 'Hilbert' space found by
canonical quantization of () but the non-analyticity of the
non-linear transformations () makes it difficult to see how
to
do this. We
can overcome this problem by introducing the new variables
^i = ^i[1+ ]^12  ,
in terms of which the  supersymmetry transformations are
analytic:
_^i = ^i +  ^i.
The Lagrangian in these new variables is(There is some similarity
to the QM reduction of the Volkov-Akulov model which realizes
Poincare supersymmetry non-linearly in terms of a Goldstino
variable.) 
L =  i[1 + ]^-1  .
This Lagrangian can be shown to be the 1-dimensional pullback of
the  connection one-form in the nonlinear realization of  in
the Grassmann-odd coset space . It is shifted by a total
derivative
under the  transformations and so is a sort of 1-dimensional
Wess-Zumino (WZ) term. It contains 'interactions' which complicate
the canonical quantization
procedure, but this problem is easily solved in a way that will
now be described.

Analytic quantization 

An equivalent phase-space form of the  Lagrangian () is
lagphase 
L =  i- ^i_i + c.c. 
where  are Lagrange multipliers for  complex phase space
constraints, with constraint functions
defvarphi 
_i = _i - 2 [1 + ]^-1 
_i.
Solving these constraints returns us to the original Lagrangian, up to a
total derivative. The -supersymmetry transformations of the new
Lagrangian are
susyphase 
^i &=& ^i + ^i, _i &=& 2 _i + _i-
_i, ^i &=& ^i +
^i.
The  complex constraint functions  are
equivalent to  real constraint functions that are second class, in
Dirac's terminology. However, the  complex constraint functions are in
involution; it is only when we consider their complex conjugates that the
system of constraints becomes second class. In it was shown
that
when  real second class constraints can be separated into two sets of
 real constraints in involution then one may quantize without
constraints on canonical space variables by imposing one set of 
constraints on the Hilbert space states and discarding the other
set(To our knowledge, for
systems with Grassmann second-class constraints the possibility of such a
quantization scheme was mentioned for the first time in. The
idea behind it is that one set of constraints can be
interpreted as the  gauge-fixing conditions for  gauge-invariances
generated by the other set.) . Here we shall adopt an 'analytic'
version of this procedure which, for Grassman variables, actually
preceded the formulation of the method for the real case; in this
context it has been called 'Gupta-Bleuler quantization'.

As the method involves working with an unconstrained phase
space, the anticommutation relations follow directly from the canonical
Poisson brackets, and these may be realized by setting(The
classical anticommuting variable  is the complex
conjugate of the variable , whereas the complex conjugate of
 is, for standard complex conjugation conventions,
. The conjugation in the quantum case
should be understood with respect to the properly defined
 invariant scalar product, as discussed in section 4.) 
_i = ^i  ,^i = _i .To take the constraints into account we require that physical states be
annihilated by the  operators ; this is equivalent to the
'analyticity' conditions(This is analogous to the chirality
condition on 4D chiral superfields, which arises in a similar way from
analytic quantization of the 4D superparticle. See
 for other analogous aspects of the superparticle case.) 
^i  = 2 [1 +
]^-1 _i ,
i=1,,n,
on wave-functions . These conditions have the
solution
= [1+]^-2   for anti-analytic , which has the expansion
= c_(0)  + _i c_(1) ^i  + +
_i_1 _i_n-1   c_(n-1) ^i_1i_n-1   + _i_1 _i_n  c_(n) ^i_1 i_n ,where
c_(n-1) ^i_1i_n-1   1(n-1)! ^i_1i_n-1 i_n c_(n-1)i_n , c_(n) ^i_1 i_n  1n! ^i_1i_n c_(n)  ,  .
In principle each of the  coefficients could have any Grassmann parity
but to implement  invariance we would have to choose all of them to
have the same Grassmann parity, which must be even for a positive definite
norm. In this way we would recover the standard free-fermion Hilbert space,
as a -dimensional vector space, although the  invariance is not
manifest in our approach and has to be imposed. Here however, we wish to
explore the alternative possibility that the 'Hilbert' space carries some
representation of the supergroup . For this to be possible we
must take the anti-analytic function  to have a definite 
Grassmann parity(The same requirement is made in the standard
quantization of the superparticle, in contrast to the 'spinning
particle'. In fact, as the 4-dimensional spinning particle and
superparticle Lagrangians can be shown to be classically 
equivalent, the difference between the
two can be ascribed to
different quantization procedures, in close analogy to the
'free fermion' model considered here.) .
In this case the 'Hilbert' space is a vector superspace of
dimension ; for a reason to be made clear later, we
assume that  is Grassmann-even for  even and Grassmann-odd for 
odd. Our next task is to determine how  acts in this 'Hilbert'
space.

 in 'Hilbert' space 

The linear  transformations of the canonical variables of the
Lagrangian () are generated by the Noether charges
J^i _j = _j^i - ^i_j .
The corresponding quantum  generators are the differential operators
J^i _j = _j_i  -
^i^j .
For wave-functions of the form () we have
J^i _j = [1 + ]^-2  
_j_i ,
from which we deduce the  transformation of  to be
_=_i ^j _j_i 
where .

The nonlinear supersymmetry transformations of () are
generated by the Grassmann-odd Noether charges
S_i = _i + 2 _i - _i_j _j ^j

,S^i = ^i + 2 ^i + ^i _j
^j_j.Note the presence of the terms linear in  and ; these
arise from the fact that the supersymmetry variation of the Lagrangian
is not zero but rather a total time derivative. These terms have no
effect on the transformations of  generated by  and
, which are those of (), but they do 
contribute to the  charge in the  superalgebra of Poisson
brackets of Noether charges. In fact, one finds that the  charge is
bee 
B = (1n -1) J^i _i + where the shift by  is directly attributable to the
-dependent linear terms in  and . In
passing to the quantum theory, the coefficients of these terms become
ambiguous because of operator ordering ambiguities. This ambiguity is
partially fixed by requiring that physical wave-functions  of the
form () transform into physical wave-functions, i.e.
_   -(S  +
S)=
[1+]^-2  _  .
This leaves us with the following quantum supersymmetry generators,
parametrized by a real number :
S_i &=& ^i  +  2 _i -
_i
( ), S  ^i &=& _i  +
 2 ^i +
^i( ) . These have the anticommutation relation
S _i, S ^j  = [J ^j _i -
1n  _i^j J^k _k] + _i^j B
where  is the quantum  generator
B =  (1n -1)J^k _k + 12 (+
).
One sees from this that the choice
= is 'natural' because it leads to a quantum 
generator that is the direct quantum counterpart of the classical
 charge  of (). Nevertheless, we shall consider the
case of general  in what follows.

We now compute the action of the charges , on
physical wave-functions. One finds that
S ^i &=& [1+
]^-2  
[_i ] S_i&=&  [1+
]^-2  
[12 ( + )_i  
-_i( )].
These results yield the following -supersymmetry transformation
of :
trans 
_=
-[q() +  
- ()  ]where
q=12 (+).
For component fields in the expansion () this
transformation implies
transcomp 
&& _  c_(k) ^i_1i_k  = (-1)^k [k-1 -q]
^[i_1  c_(k-1) ^i_2 i_k]  -(1 -
_k,n )(k+1)_j c^ji_1i_k _(k+1) 
(k 2),

&& _ c_(0)  = - _i c_(1) ^i, _ c_(1) ^i = q^i c_(0)  + 2_j
c^ji _(2) .
The full set of  transformations of  are such that
transphi 
=e^iqs()  ()
where  is a local function of . Thus,  is a scalar
anti-analytic superfield when q=0; for other values of , including
the 'natural' value , one may consider  as a charged
scalar superfield, with charge .

We have supposed up to now that  and  are arbitrary real
variables but one might expect the combination  to be
quantized(For example, we have  for the 'natural'
choice  but, as mentioned earlier,  is the
coefficient of a WZ term. By analogy with the bosonic WZ terms, this
coefficient is expected to be quantized, though the origin of this
phenomenon can differ according to the case considered.) . As we
shall see, the representation
content of
the physical 'Hilbert' space depends on  and simplifications,
associated with the existence of zero norm states, occur for special
integer values of .




-invariant norm 

In order to construct an invariant inner product one must first obtain an
 invariant measure under the coordinate transformations
(). With the help of the lemma
_[1+ ] =
(-)[1+
],
it is not difficult to show that the  invariant measure is such
that
d= d_0 [1 + ]^n-1  ,
where
d_0 = _i _i 
^i .
However, because the transformation () involves a
 weight term, an additional factor is needed in the measure when
. Let us replace  by  to remind us that 
carries  charge . Then the following bilinear form is
 invariant:
_(q) ^2=
 d[1 + ]^-q 
_(q) ^2.
Note that the additional factor in the measure is unity precisely when
 but is non-trivial otherwise.

In terms of the original wave-functions 
, the
 invariant
scalar product corresponding to the definition () reads
<> = d_0 [1 + ]^ 
^ where
= - q + n-1 and  is another vector in the same 'Hilbert space'.
It is straightforward to check that the quantum generators ()
are mutually conjugate with respect to this scalar product
(<S _i>)^= <S  ^i
>.
On the other hand, for  the fermionic momentum operators
 and
 are not mutually conjugate with
respect to
(). Note, however, that () is defined modulo
the following similarity transformation (change of basis) in
'Hilbert space'
  =[1+ ]^  '_() ,
  =[1+ ]^  '_() 
,
(^= ). This amounts to the substitution  
 and
shift  in the definition
(), as well as a corresponding change in the observables.
The conjugacy property () of the  supersymmetry
generators is evidently basis-independent. In contrast, an analogous
conjugacy property holds for the fermionic momentum operators only for
the special choice of basis corresponding to :
(< '_(-/2) /^i '_(-/2) >)^=
< '_(-/2) /_i '_(-/2) >.
Thus, the fermionic momentum operators () are mutually
conjugate in the sense that there is a basis in 'Hilbert space' for
which they satisfy ().

Let us now turn to the analysis of the field content of  implied by
the invariant norm ().
In general, there are contributions to () from all coefficients
in the expansion (), but zero norm states occur for special
values of . For example, when  we have
_(n-1) ^2 = c_(n) ^2. As  for this choice of  we see that the
physical Hilbert space is an  singlet. All functions
 with  have zero norm. If instead we set
 then we find
_(n-2) ^2 = c_n^2 -c_(n-1)  ^i  c_(n-1)i .
Again there are zero norm states because the  representation
content appearing in the norm is restricted to ;
these  representations combine to form the fundamental 
  representation of . As a final example, consider .
In this case we have
_(0) ^2 = (-1)^n (n-1)!
^n_k=1  (-1)^k  k c_(k)i_1i_k 
c^i_1i_k _(k) . The  representation content is

.

An inspection of the transformations () leads to the
following general conclusions about the structure of the 'Hilbert
spaces' corresponding to different choices of . For the
choice
condirr 
q= (k  -1),
for integer  in the range  (the
examples
above correspond to , respectively) there is an invariant
irreducible subspace spanned by
set 
c_(k ) ^i_1i_k   , , c^i_1i_n _(n)  .
For  this subspace is the full space of coefficients of 
but
otherwise it is not, and the remaining coefficients are transformed into
the above set; this shows that the representation of  carried
by  is reducible but not fully reducible. The norm
 includes only the components (), so there
exist zero norm states unless .

As the set () is irreducible
under the action of , we can consistently set them to zero:
c_(k ) ^i_1i_k    = c_(k  +1) ^i_1i_k  +1   =
 =
c^i_1i_n _(n)  = 0 . The complementary set of coefficients then forms an irreducible
set on its own, and one would expect there to exist a corresponding
-invariant norm. However, the 'obvious' norm, defined by
(), is identically zero when () is satisfied;
this is easily seen by rewriting () in the superfield form
^k  _(q) _i_1 _i_k     = 0 (and c.c. ).
One can check that these constraints are covariant under ()
provided that the condition () holds. Of course, they do not
correspond to constraints in the Lagrangian () so what we
are now doing cannot be considered as a quantization of that 
Lagrangian but one could add to it the classical
constraints corresponding to (), for which the constraint
functions are polynomials in .

It is remarkable that for  constrained
by () there exists the following alternative  norm
alternnorm 
 _(k -1) ^2 = d_0 (1 + )^n
-
k  
(1 + )
  _(k -1)   _(k -1) .
Taking into account that
_(1 + ) = (-
) ,
it is straightforward to prove invariance of () given
the constraints (), which are crucial to the result.
It is interesting that the 'Lagrangian density' in () is
not a tensor one as in (), but has an additional variation into
a total derivative, as is typical for WZ or Chern-Simons lagrangians.

 and BRST 


We shall now illustrate the above results with the  case;
we also choose , which means that the 'natural' choice of
operator ordering corresponds to . For  we can interpret
the odd coset space  as a BRST superspace because
 is the Euclidean BRST supergroup.  For 
we have
_(q)  = a + _i b^i + _1_2 c .
The coefficients , which form an  doublet, can be
interpreted as (euclidean) Faddeev-Popov ghost and antighost for the
-singlet gauge-fixing term ; the other  singlet 
is then the 'Nakanishi-Lautrup' auxiliary field.

>From () we deduce that the
-supersymmetry transformations for  are
_a &=& -_i b^i, _b^i &=& -^ij _j c,_c &=& _ij  ^i b^j, where 
.
This is not a reducible representation because  transforms
non-trivially while  span a 3-dimensional invariant subspace.
Observe that
_(0) ^2 = c^2  + b^ib_iis invariant. Of course, this is not really a norm
as the variables  are anticommuting.(For odd  this
feature presents a difficulty because in this case the  are
Grassmann odd and the  are Grassmann even, but this
difficulty is overcome by changing the Grassmann parity of ;
this is why we earlier required  and 
to be even for  and odd for . With this definition,
the norm for bosonic variables is always positive semi-definite.) 
In other words, the physical states are vectors in a vector superspace
of dimension  transforming as the fundamental representation of
.

For  the transformations () become
_a &=& -_i b^i, _b^i &=& -^ij _j c + ^i
a,_c &=& 0.This is the 'natural' case for which the physical Hilbert space is a
singlet. Indeed, the  norm () in this case is simply
_(1) ^2 = c^2.
Still with , we may impose the covariant condition
c = 0 ^2  _(1)  _i _k  = 0 .
This leaves us with the irreducible multiplet :
_a &=& -_i b^i, _b^i &=& ^i a.
The alternative norm is
 _(1) ^2 &=& - d_0(1 +)
 _(1) _(1)  &=& a^2 + b_i b^i so physical states once again transform as a fundamental 
 representation of  (the precise correspondence with the
realization
(), () is achieved via substitutions 
,
, where  and

are transformed just as  and ).

Finally, we shall consider , for which the transformation law
() becomes
_a &=& -_i b^i, _b^i &=& -^ij _j c - ^i
a,_c &=& 2_ij  ^i b^j and the invariant norm calculated by the formula () is
_(-1) ^2 = c^2 + 2a^2 - 2b_ib^i .
In this case one cannot single out any invariant subspace and
so ends up with a 4-dimensional irreducible multiplet 
 of .


Discussion 

We have shown that the mechanics of  free complex Grassmann-odd variables
provides a non-linear realization of the supergroup . It can be
viewed as the mechanics of a 'particle' with the Grassmann-odd coset space
 as its phase space. This model is trivial in the sense that
its Hamiltonian vanishes but it is the simplest of a class of models that
realize  non-linearly and for which the Hamiltonian is generically
non-zero. The particle on  is an example, and
one that will be considered in a future publication. Part of the
motivation of this paper was to exhibit some of the properties of these
models in the simplest possible setting. Another motivation is that
coset-spaces of the  supergroup  can be interpreted as
BRST superspaces.

We have shown that there exists an alternative quantization of the
'free fermion' model that implements the classical  symmetry. In
contrast to the standard quantization, for which the states transform as a
spinor of , the states of the alternative quantum theory are vectors
in a vector superspace transforming under . The specific
 representation content depends on the resolution of an operator
ordering ambiguity, which amounts to a choice of  charge for the
wave-function. There is a natural choice, given the initial classical
Lagrangian, because this Lagrangian can be viewed as a WZ term for
 and this leads to specific shift in the 
generator that is naturally identified with the  charge of the
quantum wave-function. For this choice, and a particular
choice of the 'coupling constant',  the 'Hilbert' space contains
zero norm states and the physical 'Hilbert' space is an 
singlet.

For other choices of  charge assignment (and other choices of
coupling constant) one gets other representations of ,
picked out by an
 invariant norm. We showed that there exists a class of integer
 charge assignments for which the representation is irreducible.
Remarkably, in this case the complementary representation contained in
the wave-function, again irreducible, could be picked out by a
different invariant, but not manifestly-invariant, norm provided that
the original representation was constrained to be absent; this case
corresponds to the quantization of the original free-fermion
Lagrangian with additional phase space constraints.

Any quantization of Grassmann-odd variables has to take into account
(explicitly or implicitly) second-class phase-space constraints. In our
case these were non-trivial because of a redefinition of variables needed
for analyticity of the  transformations. We dealt with these
constraints by a variant of the 'gauge unfixing' method involving a
separation of the constraints into analytic and anti-analytic
subsets in involution. It may be helpful if we sketch here how this
method can be used to covariantly quantize the massless 4D
superparticle, as done in. The fermionic constraint
operators are the
supercovariant derivatives  and their complex conjugates 
. These are not all second class (given ) because
the combinations  and
 are first class. Although we should
require that both of these first class operators annihilate physical
states  we need only impose 
explicitly if we also impose , as required for
'analytic quantization', because the other one is then implied. The
independent constraints are therefore  and
 (because these imply ), but
these are just the free field equations for a massless chiral superfield.
