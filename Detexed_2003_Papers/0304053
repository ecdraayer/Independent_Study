We perform a systematic study of the one-loop renormalizability of all 
Poisson-Lie T-dualizable -models with two-dimensional targets. We 
show that whatever Drinfeld double and whatever matrix of coupling 
constants we consider the corresponding -model is always one-loop 
renormalizable in the strict field theoretical sense. Moreover, in all 
cases, the RG flow in the space of the coupling 
constants is compatible with the Poisson-Lie T-duality.
  

Introduction 
Poisson-Lie T-duality is the generalization of the 
world-sheet Abelian T-duality in string theory and of 
the traditional non-Abelian T-duality. It works also 
in situations when a T-dualizable -model does not possess a 
(non)Abelian isometry but only a weaker property called 
Poisson-Lie symmetry.
                                                                     
The Poisson-Lie T-dualizable -models (or, in what follows, the PLT 
-models) are specified by the choice of a Drinfeld double and by the 
-matrix of coupling constants where  is the half of the 
dimension of the double. From the point of view of classical field theory, 
the -model and its dual are related by a canonical transformation 
; they are therefore dynamically equivalent systems.

The quantum status of the Poisson-Lie T-duality remains a challenging 
problem. We stress at this point that the word "quantum" does not 
necessarily suppose that a conformal symmetry is to be required. We 
shall simply study the duality from the point of two-dimensional 
field-theory. Whereas for the semi-abelian case the one-loop quantum 
equivalence of T-dual models has been established for a wide class of 
models, the same problem for the non-abelian case is far 
more difficult. The first steps in this direction were undertaken 
in, where the respective authors established the one-loop 
renormalizability of certain Poisson-Lie T-dualizable -models 
and the compatibility of the RG flow with the Poisson-Lie T-duality. 
They did it for a few low-dimensional Poisson-Lie targets and 
particular choices of the coupling constants.

In this paper, we would like to perform a more systematic study of 
this issue. However, we miss a classification of all PLT -models 
since it would require a preliminary classification of all the 
Drinfeld doubles (indeed, the latter project 
seems as hopeless as the classification of all Lie algebras). On the 
other hand, low dimensional doubles WERE classified in. 
Therefore we consider, e. g., all  existing two-dimensional 
Poisson-Lie T-dualizable targets. We do it and show that they are 
one-loop renormalizable and that the RG flow in the space of 
coupling constants is always compatible with the Poisson-Lie T-duality.



Generic 2 dimensional Poisson-Lie models 
Four dimensional Drinfeld doubles 
A Drinfeld double  is a Lie algebra  
with generators  and  
 equipped with a symmetric and ad-invariant 
non-degenerate bilinear form  such that
dr1 
T_i,T_jT ^i,T ^j
T_i,T ^jT ^j,T_i
It is moreover required that the linear subspaces 
 and  are 
respectively the subalgebras of 

As shown by all the four-dimensional non-isomorphic 
Drinfeld doubles, denoted as  can be written  
dr2 lll 
[T_1,T_2]=T_2& [T_1,T ^1]=0 & [T_1,T ^2]=
-T ^2 

[T ^1,T ^2]=T ^2& [T_2,T ^1]=T_2 & 
[T_2,T ^2]=T ^1-T_1.and are of three  non-isomorphic types:
The fully abelian double 
The semi-abelian double 
The non-abelian double  with Let us construct the Poisson-Lie -models out of these doubles.

The Poisson-Lie models and their T-duals 
A general Poisson-Lie T-dualizable -model has for actionpl1 
(R(g)+)^-1 _ij  (_+gg^-1 )^i(_-gg^-1 )^j,where
_ =_ _ and  and  are the "time " and "space" coordinates on the 
world-sheet. The model () lives on a group manifold  
(corresponding to the Lie algebra ) and it is parametrized 
by a set of coupling constants assembled into the matrix 

In order to determine the -dependent matrix  one 
first defines a triplet of matrices as follows
pl11 
Ad (g^-1 )T_ig^-1 T_ig=a(g)_i^ l T_l,Ad (g^-1 )T ^i=b(g)^il T_l+d(g)^i_ l T ^l.Then
(g)=b(g)a^-1 (g).Note that the matrices  are defined by the adjoint action of  
 on the Lie algebra 

In our two-dimensional case, we may realize the group  in the 
matrix way as follows
g=(cc  e^  & 
 0 & 1)and the generators ,  are given by
T_1=(cc   & 0
 0 & 0),T_2=(cc   0 & 
 0 & 0), T^1=(cc   0 & 0
 0 & ),T^2=(cc   0 & 0 
 -& 0).
Thus we have for the matrices
pll11 
a(g)=(cc  1 & e^- 

 0 & e^- ),
b(g)=(cc  0 & -e^- 
 
& ^2 e^- ),which lead to
pl12 
(g)=b(g)a^-1 (g)cc  0 & -
 
& 0).The matrix  is
pl2 
R=(cc  x & y 
 z & w),
R=xw-yz0,and the right-invariant vielbein
pl3 
dgg^-1 =dT_1+(dd)T_2.Then we obtain from the action () the 
resulting target space metric,pl5 
G=b d^2+x d^2
-2a dd,
with the definitions
pl6 
a=x()+y+z 2 ,b=x()^2+(y+z)()+w,and the torsion potential
pl7 
  dd.Since the target space is two-dimensional, the torsion 3-form vanishes. 

The T-dualized model lives on the dual group target  and 
its action readsdual 
 (R+(g))^-1  ^ij 
(_+gg^-1 )_i(_-gg^-1 )_j,
where  and the  dependent matrix is given by
 (g )=b (g )a ^-1 (g ),where the dual matrices  are defined similarly by

Ad _g^-1  T^i= a(g)^i_ l T^l,Ad _g^-1   T_i=b(g)_il T^l+d(g)_i^ l T_l.

The elements  of the dual group  are of the form
g=(cc  0&0
 -& e^  )and one can check that the matrices are 
obtained from  by the interchange of the parameters 
 and  This leads to
dual2 
(g)=(cc  0 & -
& 0).
 
Finally, the vielbein is now
dual4 
dg g ^-1 =dT _1+(dT _2.
Inserting all these quantities in the T-dualized Poisson-Lie model 
()gives the same target space metric  () in 
which  is transformedinto  and  and 
 get exchanged.

From the previous considerations one can check that the abelian model and its 
T-dual partner are both flat, so we will not consider this trivial possibility
and we will take  in what follows.
  

Isometry and form invariance of the metric 
These metrics have the obvious Killing  with 
dual 1-form 
fi3 
K=a^2+^2 x da d.Besides this isometry, the left group action induces a two 
parameters group of transformation  of the coordinates 
and of the parameters 
fi1 l 
 = =+,x =x,

y =y+(x-1),z =z+(x+1),

w =^2 w+(y+z)+^2 x,
.>0,  R .Using the relations
fi2 
a =a,b =^2 b,  =^2,it is easy to check that  leaves the metric invariant in the 
sense that

The existence of this group implies that we can get rid 
of two parameters in the matrix  we can always take  and
  Indeed, let us consider a set of the parameters 
such that  neither  nor  Using the transformations laws given
above, if we  take for parameters


we can ensure simultaneously the relations  and
  Notice that we have anticipated the positivity restriction
on    which comes out from the riemannian character of the metric (see
()).  In what follows we will therefore take
R1 
R=(cc  x & y 
 y & x),x>0,
^2x^2-y^2>0,yR .                                                                               
For the semi-abelian model, corresponding to  the 
lagrangian is

where  is given in (). This metric is flat, so there is no
renormalization of the parameters. Its T-dual model is not flat, but 
as shown in, it is flat up to some diffeomorphism, and the 
one-loop equivalence between the T-dual pair of models is preserved. 

So the remaining open problem is the non-abelian
model: since  appropriate scalings of  and of the 
coordinates allow to take  As observed in the full 
family of  Drinfeld doubles  gives rise to a single
-model  with   the  model of.
 
The actual form of the metric is now
nmet1 
G=b d^2+x d^2
-2a dd,with the new functions
nmet2 
a=x+y,b=x^2+2y+x=a^2+^2 x ,
^2=x^2-y^2.Its T-dual partner is obtained by the change of parameters
nmet3 
x    x =xx^2-y^2 ,
y    y =-yx^2-y^2 .Geometric aspects 
Let us check the Riemannian character of the metric (). This 
is best done through a calculation of the vielbein 
pl8 
G=(e_1)^2+(e_2)^2,e_1= x  d,
e_2=xdx  ,The metric will be riemannian iff
riem ^2>0,x>0.It follows that  never vanishes. In the sequel we will 
assume that these conditions hold.

Another interesting point is to find the coordinates which do exhibit 
the conformally flat character of this metric. Taking for 
these coordinates 
ff2 
U=12(a^2()+^2),V=(a()  ),a()=x+y,the metric  becomes
ff1 
G=x^2 (yV-V)^2+x^2^2^2 V (dU^2+dV^2),and it will be flat iff the denominator in the pre-factor is some constant. 
An easy algebraic discussion leads to the conclusion that the 
non-abelian model is flat iff
ff3 
x=1and y=0
R=I .

Frame geometry 
The spin connection, defined by 

is given by
fg3 
_12 =12 N d+xNd x ,with
fg4 
N =(a^2+^2)'N=awhere a prime indicates a derivative with respect to  One obtains
N 
N=2y^2=x^2-y^2,and
calN 
N 2x =-y(^2-^2)+x(^2-1).The curvature (in the vielbein basis) has the single component
fg5 
R_12,12 =1^2 (N N ') 2x ,and we have for the Ricci
ricci 
Ric _11 =Ric _22 =R_12,12 ,Ric _12 =0.The explicit form of the curvature component is 
fg7  
N N ' 2x =
x(^2-1)(^2-^2)+4y^2.One-loop renormalizability 
The one-loop renormalizability is ensured if the Ricci tensor can be written
r1 
Ric _ij =()G_ij +_(i w_j) ,
 x_k ,where the  are parameters of the lagrangian to be renormalized and  is 
some (non-Killing) vector. In the vielbein basis this becomes
r2 l 
Ric _ab = (e^-1 )_b^i()e_ai +
(e^-1 )_a^i()e_bi +D _(a w_b) ,

D _aw_b= _aw_b+_bs,a w_s,
 _a=(e^-1 )^i_a_i..
Out of these three relations, two involve only the unknown 
vector :




Defining
r3 
w_1= x  w _1,w_2=x  w _2,we get
r4 
w _1=  ,w _2= ^2 (v+y)+
(+y/x)C_2-C_1,where  is a free parameter and 
r5 
C_1=2()(yx),
C_2=x^2 ^2 ()(^2 x^2 )are constants.

Then we are left with the single relation
r6 
Ric _11 =D _1w_1+2(e^-1 )^i_a=1 ()e_a=1,i .The parameters to be renormalized are  and , so we define
r7 
The relation () gives only two relations (instead of three expected):
r8 l 
^2_x=xy+x^2(^2-1),

-2y_x+2x_y=-x(^2-1)+4y^2..Since we are left with some freedom, let us see what comes out if we impose as 
a further condition the one-loop renormalizability of the T-dualized model. This 
is most conveniently done by switching to the parameters  and  
Then the transformation () becomes
r9 
u    u =1u,v    v =1v.We will define for new renormalization constants
rr1 
 _uu_u+ _vv_v,with 
 _u=_x+_y x+y , _v=_x-_y x-y .
Relation () implies
rr2 l 
 _u(u,v)=+(1-v^2) 2v (u,v)+2vu-v u+v 
+(u+v)(uv-1) 2uv ,

 _v(u,v)=-(1-u^2) 2u (u,v)-2uu-v u+v 
+(u+v)(uv-1) 2uv ..Now  (similarly for ) is renormalized by  while 
 is renormalized by  so, 
the T-dual pair will be renormalizable provided that 
rr3 
 _u( u ,v )=- _u(u,v), _v(u ,v )=- _v(u,v).So, if we define

the joint renormalizability constraints () are equivalent to 
the single constraint
rr4 
m(u ,v )=m(u,v).The function  describes the arbitrariness left over even after imposing the 
stability of renormalizability through T-dualization. 

We have therefore shown that the T-dual pair of Poisson-Lie -models is indeed 
renormalizable, in the strict field-theoretic sense, 
with the most general structure of the renormalization constants
rr5 l 
 2 =m+u-v u+v ,

 _u=+m(1-v^2) v +(1+v^2)(u-v) v(u+v) 
+(u+v)(uv-1) 2uv ,

 _v=-m(1-u^2) u -(1+u^2)(u-v) u(u+v) 
+(u+v)(uv-1) 2uv ,.where  is constrained by (). These renormalization constants 
are well defined since, as already stated in (), the parameters 
 and  never vanish.



Conclusion 
Let us conclude with some remarks:
Absence of torsion and the dimension 2 for the target space is too poor to 
produce conformal geometries of interest for string theory. The case of 3d 
dimensional targets seem to be more promising from this point of view (cf.).
Remarkably, the renormalizability works despite the traceful structure 
constants of the Drinfeld double. However, it is important to note in this context 
that we work with strictly field theoretic renormalization where the Weyl mode 
is frozen to a constant value (the same is true for the  semi-abelian models). In the 
stringy framework, where the Weyl mode is coupled, the one-loop quantum equivalence 
requires that both sub-algebras  and  in the Drinfeld double 
must have traceless structure constants.
The problem of higher loop corrections to the Poisson-Lie T-duality appears to 
be more tricky than in the case of the Abelian or traditional non-Abelian T-duality. 
Of course, one problem to cope with is the fact that a finite one-loop renormalization 
can change the two-loops divergences. But there is also a structural 
aspect of the thing: we expect that the two-loops effective action of the model 
should not  probably have the same structure as the classical action ().
 Why? Because the Poisson-Lie symmetry should be itself only a semiclassical 
approximation of a quantum group symmetry and the full-fledged effective action 
should reflect the latter quantum symmetry rather than the former semiclassical one. 
This means that, starting from the two-loop level, we do not expect that the 
criterion of the strict field theoretical renormalizability should be respected 
but we rather believe that it should be replaced by a sort of quantum group Ward 
identities to be fulfilled by the effective action. It is only in the semiclassical 
(or one-loop) limit that these Ward identities would reduce to the strict requirement 
of the strict renormalizability. Unfortunately, we do not have any hint yet how 
to write down and test the hypothetical quantum group Ward identities. For the 
moment we just conclude that our one-loop analysis of all two-dimensional PLT targets 
indicates a good quantum health of the Poisson-Lie T-duality.
