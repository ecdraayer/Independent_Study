Introduction 

Inhw1,hw2,w1   Horava  and Witten showed that the simplest vacuum of strongly coupled heterotic superstring theory consists of an eleven dimensional bulk space bounded on either end of the eleventh dimension by a ten dimensional orbifold fixed plane. Each fixed plane supports an  supergauge theory on its worldvolume. This theory was compactified on Calabi-Yau threefolds to produce, at low energy, an effective five dimensional bulk space bounded in the fifth dimension by two three-branes. When the Calabi-Yau space supports a non-trivial  gauge instanton with structure group , the gauge group on that three-brane will no longer be . Rather, it is reduced to a group  which is the commutant of  in . In addition to these "end-of-the-world" three-branes, there are, generically, five-branes in the bulk space which are wrapped on a holomorphic curve in the Calabi-Yau threefold. This five-dimensional theory with three-branes is called heterotic M-theory. It is a fundamental paradigm for the so called "brane-world" theories of particle physics. The basic construction of heterotic M-theory was presented inlosw1,losw2,low1 .

To produce phenomenologically relevant models of particle physics on one of the three-branes, called the "observable brane", it is essential to construct the appropriate gauge instantons on the Calabi-Yau threefold. This is similar to  constructing  instantons on a flat  manifold, using for example, the ADHM methodadhm . Now, however, instantons satisfying the hermitian Yang-Mills equations must be found on a curved Calabi-Yau threefold, a much more challenging problem. The basic ideas for such a construction were presented infmw1,fmw2  for elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds using the equivalent concept of stable, holomorphic vector bundles. Extending this work, it was shown inlow2,dlow  that phenomenologically relevant grand unified theories (GUTs) can, indeed, be constructed on the observable brane. This is accomplished by compactifying Horava-Witten theory on elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds with trivial fundamental group that support holomorphic vector bundles with structure group . Choosing  to be  and , for example, leads to GUT groups  of  and  respectively.

Constructing  holomorphic  vector bundles that break the  gauge theory to standard-like models is more difficult. However, it was shown indopw-i,dopw-ii,dopw-iii,dopw-iv  that three-family models with gauge group  do exist in heterotic M-theory. This was accomplished as follows. First, elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds with non-trivial fundamental group  were constructed. It was found to be convenient to choose the base surface of these threefolds to be . See alsoschoenCY . Second, new methods were introduced for producing stable, holomorphic vector bundles with structure group  over these Calabi-Yau spaces. Such instantons break the  group to , as mentioned above. Now, however, the non-trivial  fundamental group allows topologically stable flat bundles, that is,  Wilson lines, which break  down to . Importantly, by sufficiently restricting the Calabi-Yau threefolds, it was shown that new homology classes can appear that allow the theory to be anomaly free and to admit three families of quarks and leptons.

Although very compelling in many ways, standard-like models constructed from  instantons and  Wilson lines have a potential problem. It is well-known that superstring vacua associated with GUT theories with gauge group  may allow nucleon decay more rapid than the experimental bounds. Although the nucleon decay rate can be reduced by imposing certain discrete symmetries and by superstring effects, such vacua do not exhibit a natural mechanism for suppressing nucleon decay. This problem was emphasized by Wittenw2,w3  and discussed inrt . The question of nucleon decay has motivated the authors of this paper to attempt to construct alternative standard-like models of particle physics in heterotic M-theory based on  instantons and  Wilson lines. As mentioned above,  instantons break  to an  GUT group, which is further broken to a standard-like model by a  Wilson line. The key point is that the gauge group of this standard-like model now contains an unbroken  factor, which naturally suppresses nucleon decay.

This program was begun inopr , where the requisite torus-fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds with fundamental group  were constructed. Before proceeding with the construction of  instantons on these manifolds, however, it is essential that one compute the transformation laws of certain elements of the Calabi-Yau homology ring under the  automorphism group. This is necessary in order to establish  the existence and properties of homology classes that are invariant under . As discussed indopw-i,dopw-ii,dopw-iii,dopw-iv , such invariant classes are essential to produce three-family, anomaly free standard-like models. This rather technical, but very important, step in our program is carried out in this paper in detail.

To be specific, in Section Z  we briefly review the construction of torus-fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds with  non-trivial fundamental group . It is shown that such threefolds have the form , where  is an elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefold that is the fiber product of two rational elliptic surfaces  and . Section rat  is devoted to a detailed review of the properties of restricted surfaces  that admit at least a  automorphism group. In addition, the relevant involutions , ,  and  on , as well as the  generating automorphisms  and , are defined and discussed. Inopr  and Section rat , it is shown that generic  surfaces allowing an involution  are elliptically fibered with projection map  and are four-fold covers of a surface . However, the strong restrictions on  necessary to allow a  automorphism group, also produce extra structure on these surfaces. In Section double , it is shown that  can, alternatively, be expressed as a two-fold cover of another surface . Using this result, we demonstrate in Section ruled  that the restricted surfaces are "ruled". That is, these surfaces have a second fibration with projection  whose generic fiber is not elliptic but, rather, the projective space . These, admittingly technical, results play an important role. They allow one to identify, and give the properties of, a canonical set of generators of , which we denote by  and . This is done in  Section basis . Sections -1 , alpha  and  trans  are devoted to computing the explicit transformation laws of these generators under the involutions , , and ,  respectively.  These results are then composed to produce the action of the  automorphism group on the canonical set of generators. This is carried out in Section comp , where an explicit table of the transformations of the generators  and  of  under all relevant involutions is presented. Having found the  action on , we can search for the curve classes that are invariant under this action. In Section comp , we show that these are generated by four invariant classes, which are presented explicitly. Finally, in Section XZ , using the construction outlined in Section Z , we "lift" the four invariant classes on each of  and  to the fiber product manifold . By construction, these classes are in . It is shown that  has seven independent homology generators which are invariant under the  automorphism group on . These classes are, of course, constructed from the lift of invariant classes on  and . We explicitly exhibit these seven generators. Clearly, they survive the modding out of  by the  action. Therefore, the torus-fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds  with fundamental group  admit a rank seven  homology group , as required to produce anomaly free, three family standard-like models.

Having established these requisite results, we can turn to the problem of constructing stable, holomorphic vector bundles with  structure group  on the Calabi-Yau threefolds . This will be accomplished indopr-i . A detailed discussion of the associated particle physics will appear indopr-iii,dlor . A more precise mathematical discussion of the entire program is also in preparationdopr-ii . We emphasize to the reader that, although much of our discussion was within the context of the strongly coupled heterotic superstring, that is, M-theory, our results are equally applicable to weakly coupled heterotic vacua.























The Calabi-Yau Threefolds  Z 

To make the paper self contained and to fix notation, we recall in this section the construction of torus fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds  with fundamental group 
_1(Z)=Z _2 Z _2.
For a more complete exposition, the reader is referred toopr . To construct torus fibered Calabi-Yau spaces  with non-trivial first homotopy group, one starts with simply connected elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds . Denote the projection map by
: X B^' .
The generic fiber of  is isomorphic to a torus . Furthermore, there exists a zero section  which fixes a unique point on each fiber. This point acts as the identity of an Abelian group, turning  into an elliptic curve. In our construction, the base  is chosen to be isomorphic to a rational elliptic surface . Being a rational elliptic surface,  is itself elliptically fibered over . We denote its projection map by
^' : B^' P ^1' .
It can be shown, see for exampleopr , that every elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefold  over a base  which is isomorphic to  is actually a fiber product  of two rational elliptic surfaces  and . That is,
X=B_1  B^' ,
where
B_1  B^' =(b,b^' )B B^'   (b)=^' (b^' )
and  and  are the projection maps of the two rational elliptic surfaces. Note that hidden in the definition of  is an isomorphism  which identifies these spaces. The fiber product structure allows us to construct involutions  on  in terms of involutions  and  on  and  respectively.

As proven inopr , when  and  are each restricted to a two-parameter subset of  surfaces, there exists a freely acting automorphism group  on . This group is generated by two  commuting involutions  and  defined as
invX 
_X1 =_B1 _1  _B^' 1 ,_X2 =_B2 _1  _B^' 2 ,
where  and  for  are involutions on  and . It follows that one can define a smooth quotient manifold
Z=X/(Z _2 Z _2).
It was proven inopr, dopr-ii  that  is indeed a Calabi-Yau threefold, albeit one with  no global sections. Hence, it is only a torus fibration and is not elliptically fibered.
Clearly,  to understand these Calabi-Yau threefolds , it is essential to understand the properties of the Calabi-Yau manifolds  and the action of the automorphism group . 
However, it follows from the above discussion that the properties of   and its automorphism group  are determined by the choice of the rational elliptic surfaces  and , the involutions  and  for  on these surfaces and the specification of an identification map . We turn, therefore, to the properties of rational elliptic surfaces and the classification of their involutions.


Rational Elliptic Surfaces rat 

We begin this section by considering generic rational elliptic surfaces.
As already mentioned, a rational elliptic surface  is an elliptic fibration over . We denote the projection map by
beta 
: B 1 .
The generic fiber of  is isomorphic to a torus . Furthermore, there is a zero section 
e: 1 B
which fixes a unique zero point on each fiber, turning it into an elliptic curve. 
In addition,  there exists a second projection map, denoted by  inopr , such that
_2: B 2 .
The pre-image of  for a generic point , that is , consists of one point. However, at nine points, which we denote by  for ,
_2^-1 (_a)e_a1 .
Hence,  is a blow-up of  at nine points. This description of  is very useful in  determining several geometric properties of the surface. We find that the generators for the homology classes of  are the nine blow-up  lines  , also called exceptional divisors, and the pull-back  of a line  in .  We simply denote  by  as well. That is,  the lattice  is spanned by these ten elements.
Since  is connected, it follows that   and, hence,   is generated by a point. Additionally, since  is compact and orientable, . Using, for example, the Van Kampen theorem, one can show that  and  vanish. Therefore, the topological Euler characteristic of  is given by
(B)=_i=0 ^4  (-1)^i  H_i (B,Z )=1+10+1=12.
It is easy to calculate the canonical bundle , where we have denoted the holomorphic cotangent bundle of  by . The result is
can 
K_B=_2^* K_2  O _B(_i=1 ^9 e_i)=O _B(-3l+_i=1 ^9 e_i).
As shown inopr , these geometric properties, derived using the projection , have consequences for the fibration .
The first consequence is that one can consider the exceptional divisors  as sections of this fibration. For concreteness, we choose the zero section to be
e=e_9.
It was shown inopr  that the class of a generic fiber of (beta ) is given by
df 
f=3l-_i=1 ^9 e_i.
Therefore, (can ) can be written as
K_B=O _B(-f).
Since the Euler characteristic of a smooth torus vanishes, the fact that  requires the occurrence of singular fibers of (beta ). For generic surfaces , these singular fibers are of Kodaira typekodaira-casIII   with . Hence, there are twelve such fibers. 

Having discussed the basic properties of generic rational elliptic surfaces , we can proceed to determine all possible involutions on them. As shown inopr , all involutions
_B: B B
induce an involution on the base , namely, , obeying 
_B = _1  .
Hence,  maps each fiber  to some possibly different fiber . Since involutions  are either the identity map  or a non-trivial map with two fixed points, where the fixed points determine  uniquely, the induced action on the base  gives a crude classification of involutions on . Let us first consider  those involutions which act as the identity on the base.

One such involution is canonically given for any elliptic fibration, namely
(-1)_B : B B.
It is defined as follows. Since the zero section  fixes a unique zero on each fiber, which we denote by  as well, each fiber forms an Abelian group. We will denote the operation of addition on each fiber by   and the operation of inverse on any element  by . The restriction of  to a fiber maps each point  of that fiber to its Abelian group inverse. Therefore, we obtain
(-1)_B_f (a)= . -   a.
Since the choice of the identity element  is determined by the global section ,  is defined globally. Furthermore,  induces an automorphism on the global sections of . That is
(-1)_B : (B)(B),
where  denotes the set of global sections of the fibration . More specifically, for any section 
3.15 
(-1)_B()=. -  ,
where  is defined as follows. Consider any point  and let . Then the section  is defined by .

Another automorphism of  which acts trivially on the base  is given, for any section , by the translation .  If we denote the point of  intersection of  with a fiber  by  as well, then the action of  is given by
t_ _f: a a. +  for each point  on . Again, the action  is globally defined and induces an automorphism on the global sections of , namely
3.17 
t_(s) = s. +  
for any section  in . For  and ,  is defined by . Note that (3.15 ) and (3.17 ) induce an Abelian group structure on . Since this structure is defined in terms of the group law on each fiber, we continue to denote addition and inverse on  by   and .(It is helpful at this point to discuss our notation in more detail. On any fibered surface , a section  will determine a homology class, also denoted by , in . There is a natural notion of addition and inverse in  which we denote everywhere in this paper by  and . For generic fibered surfaces, however, there is no group law on . When  is elliptically fibered, a notion of addition and inverse on  does exist. To distinguish this from the group law on , we denote the group law on  by  and .)  It is clear, that  is generically not an involution. A necessary condition for it to be an involution is that the section  intersect each fiber at a point of order two, that is, . There are four such points on each fiber, which  we denote by  and . Of course, the identity element  is one such point. Observe that  points of order two are also fixed under the action of . For example
(-1)_B (e^' )=. -  e^' =(e^' . +  e^' ). -  e^' =e^' .
However, the above condition is not sufficient to guarantee that  global sections  with   exist. In fact, for generic elliptic surfaces  they do not. They can occur, however, in a restricted subset of surfaces . We will use such restricted surfaces to construct the Calabi-Yau threefolds .

A further type of involution  on  which induces a trivial action on the base  is given by 
_B=t_ (-1)_B.
However, since it is impossible to lift these involutions to a fixed point free involution on , we will not consider them further.

We now discuss involutions on  which act non-trivially on the base . By a theorem ofdopw-i , each such involution can be written as 
_B=t__B,
where  is an involution of  leaving the zero section  fixed and inducing a non-trivial action on . That is,  where  is a non-trivial involution on  with two fixed points, which we call  and . The section  must have the property that
xi 
_B()=(-1)_B().
As shown inopr , a generic rational elliptic surface  does not admit such involutions . However, there is five dimensional sub-family in the eight dimensional family of rational elliptic surfaces which does allow such involutions. Furthermore, it was shown indopw-i  that each member of this five dimensional sub-family has a rank four lattice of sections  fulfilling condition (xi ).

As described inopr ,  leaves two fibers of  stable, namely  and . Furthermore, it was shown that  acts as the identity map on  and as  on . Hence, the double cover
3.22 
: B B/_B
has the image of  and the image of the four points of order two of the fiber  under  as its branch locus. Hence, the image of , that is  , contains four isolated  surface singularities of .

These can be resolved by blowing up and one obtains an  fiber.
It was shown inopr  that, for generic  in the five parameter family of rational elliptic surfaces, the quotient  can be described as the double cover of . That is
3.23 
: B/_B Q,
where the branch locus  of  consists of the union of  a  curve  and a  curve . These are shown in  Figure gen-M , where  the two natural projections of ,  to both  factors of  are also defined.

Having described all possible involutions on rational elliptic surfaces , we now further restrict ourselves to a two dimensional sub-family of rational elliptic surfaces. These were used inopr  to construct Calabi-Yau threefolds  with two freely acting involutions. Since this two dimensional family is a subset of the five dimensional family mentioned above, these surfaces continue to admit  involutions .
However, for these restricted surfaces, the curve  splits into , where  is a  curve and  and  are  rulings. See Figure 2df  for a pictorial description of them.

Note that   intersects each of  and  at one point. Call these points  and  respectively. Furthermore,  and  each intersect  at a single point, which  we denote by as  and . 

What is the double cover  of  corresponding to this restricted branch locus? For maximal clarity, we will here denote this double cover by , relating it to  only later. We continue to indicate the covering map by . Let us consider the composition map . Clearly, we have the projection map
tildep 
p _1: W_M 1 .
The fiber of , for a generic point  , is the double cover of the fiber of projection  at this point, branched over the four points where this fiber intersects the branch locus , namely, at its intersection with  and . It was shown inopr  that this generic  fiber of  is isomorphic to a torus. Hence,  
is a torus fibration. What is the double cover of the fiber corresponding to the point ? Since  is in the branch locus itself,  is a double  line. Furthermore, since  intersects the other components of the branch curve , namely,  and  at   and  respectively,  has four  surface singularities on  located at   for . Recall fromopr  that resolving these singularities would produce an  fiber.
In addition to , there are three other fibers of  which contain singular points of . Singular points  occur when different components of the branch locus of  intersect. Clearly, the remaining intersection  points are in the fibers  and . As explained inopr , the double covers of these three fibers in   are singular, each containing an  surface singularity.  After resolving the singularities, each of these fibers consists of two components, the proper transform of the original fiber and an exceptional divisor which is isomorphic to . This is called an  fiber in the Kodaira classification and is sketched in Figure I2 .

To conclude, the fibration  has four singular fibers, one containing four  singularities and the remaining three with one  singularity each. Resolving these singularities, we obtain a  smooth surface, which we denote by , with  one  fiber and  three  fibers. Recall fromopr  that  and . Therefore . 
Furthermore, the fibration  has four special sections, namely ,  and . These sections, each of which is isomorphic to , are described graphically in Figure four-s . Choosing one of them, which we take to be   , as the zero section completes the proof that  is a rational elliptically fibered surface with one  fiber and three . As discussed inopr ,  is its Weierstrass model. We can  summarize the projections  and  in the diagram

P ^1  [r]_id   & P ^1  & & 

  
Recall fromopr  that  one can choose a smooth fiber, which we call , in  and construct the double cover of  branched over  and the four singular points in . One then obtains the double cover  of , which we denote by  with the cover map
 : B  W_M.
This double covering map   induces an involution   on , which acts non-trivially as  on the base . Defining 
sq: 1  1 /_1  
and noting that , we obtain
d2 

B  [r]^-   [d]_-   & W_M [d]^-p _1   [drr]-,  &&

P ^1  [r]_sq   & P ^1  & & 

 
which defines the fibration . It is important to note that , the double cover of , is not yet the surface . The reason is the following.

Let us  recall fromopr  some of the properties of . First, from the diagram (d2 ) it is easy to see that a generic fiber of  has two disjoint pre-images in . These form two fibers of the fibration  and get exchanged by the involution . Hence, only the fibers  and  are stable in . We denote these fibers  by  and  respectively. Of course, these are the fibers over the fixed points  and  of , the involution on  induced by . Although  in  contains four surface singularities of type , its pre-image   in   is smooth. This is explained inopr  and follows from the fact that the pre-images of the four singularities of  in  are fixed under the covering involution . Be that as it may,  does have singular fibers. Recall that  had three additional singular fibers containing an  surface singularity. Since these fibers are generically not  and  in , their pre-images each  consists of two fibers in . Clearly, each such fiber contains an  surface singularity. Therefore, there are six fibers in  containing a surface singularity of type . We conclude that the surface  is singular, whereas the rational elliptic surface  is smooth. Therefore,  differs from , being obtained from it by blowing up each of the six  singularities, as we will discuss below. 

What are the pre-images of the four special sections of ? First consider . Recall that   intersects the fiber  in  and contains the singular point . Hence, it intersects the branch locus of  in two points and its pre-image  is the double cover of . Since , it follows that   is isomorphic to  as well. Furthermore, since  intersects each fiber of  once, it is a section of the fibration . Note that  also contains two  surface singularities, namely the  pre-image .

The pre-images under  of  and  have similar properties. They form sections of  each containing two  surface singularities, namely the two points    and the two points  respectively. The pre-image  in , the double cover of  branched over  and , is isomorphic to  as well. Clearly, it is also a section of . However, unlike  the other three  sections ,  and  ,  contains all six  surface singularities. This follows from the fact that   contains  and .

Having discussed the singular surfaces , we finally can construct their resolution, the rational elliptic surfaces  that  we wish to consider. If we denote by   the blow-up of   at the six  singularities and let  be the projection map, then  clearly
blow 

B [r]^c  [d]_-  & B  [d]^-    [drr]-,  &&

P ^1  [r]_id   & P ^1  & & 

  
which defines the fibration  as . Combining diagrams (d2 ) and (blow ), we see that
: B W_M
is the covering of  by  where . We denote by  the induced involution on  of . 

What are the fibers of ? As described inopr , each singular fiber with an  surface singularity can be resolved into an  fiber. Hence,  has six  fibers, namely, the pre-images of ,  and . Let us denote the exceptional divisors corresponding to  by  and , the exceptional divisors corresponding to  by  and  and the exceptional divisors corresponding to  by  and . The associated proper transforms are denoted  . Hence, the six  fibers in  have the structure  .

Next, consider the proper transform of the four distinguished sections in . Clearly, they are still sections of . Following the notation ofopr , we denote the proper transform of  by , the proper transform of  by  and the proper transform of  by .  From the distribution of the singularities  at the image of these sections in , as described above, it is clear that  intersects  and ,  intersects  and  and  intersects  and . We will show in the next section that the proper transform of  is .

At this point, we want to make an important technical comment. As discussed above,  is the singular four-fold cover of . , on the other hand, is a smooth surface obtained by blowing up the singularities in . The exact relationship is expressed in (blow ). However, in most of the remaining discussion in this paper, one can readily distinguish whether a surface is  or its blow-up  from context. With this in mind, we find that it leads to enormous simplification of our notation if we simply use the symbol  to denote both  and . In keeping with this notation, we will also denote both sets of mappings  and  by . We do this henceforth. With this simplified notation, we can identify
W_MB/_B,
as in (3.22 ) and (3.23 ). In a few places when it is helpful to specify the surface and the associated mappings exactly, we will do so.

As inopr , we choose  to be the zero section of the rational elliptic surface . Furthermore, as we will show in the next section,  and  are sections of  which intersect each fiber at a point of order two. Hence
(-1)_B (e_9)=e_9,(-1)_B (e_6)=e_6,(-1)_B (e_4)=e_4.
It is clear from the construction that ,  and   are invariant under . Hence, they fulfill condition (xi ). Note, in addition, that  is a section of  which intersects each fiber at a point of order two.  It follows that it too satisfies (xi ). Using these sections, we can define the two involutions
inv 
_B1 =t_e_6 _B,_B2 =t_e_4 _B.
Using the fact that 
_B1 _B2 =t_e_4 . +   e_6 
and
t_e_4 . +   e_6 ^2=id,
it was shown inopr  that  and  commute.
It was explained inopr  that one can lift these commuting involutions to freely acting involutions on the Calabi-Yau threefolds . Henceforth, we will assume (inv ) to be the generators of the  automorphism group on the rational elliptic surface .

We choose the rational elliptic surface  to be within the same two dimensional family. We denote the components of its  fibers by  and . The zero section is denoted by  and the other sections of order two by ,  and . The generators of the  automorphism group on  are then given by
_B^' 1 =t_e_6^'  _B^' ,_B^' 2 =t_e_4^'  _B^' .
This concludes our review of rational elliptic surfaces. As discussed in Section Z , the fiber product  is a Calabi-Yau threefold and admits the two commuting involutions
_X1 =_B1 _1  _B^' 1 ,_X2 =_B2 _1  _B^' 2 .
They can be shownopr  to generate a freely acting automorphism group  on . Hence, the quotient manifold
Z=X/(Z _2 Z _2)
is smooth and, as shown inopr,dopr-ii , is  a Calabi-Yau threefold.







 as a Double Cover of  double 



In this section, we begin the process of computing  the transformation laws of the elements of  of the Calabi-Yau threefolds  under the automorphism group .  To do this, we need to find the transformation laws of the second homology groups  of the rational elliptic surfaces  and  under the respective  automorphisms.

Let us consider a rational elliptic surface within the two dimensional sub-family described in the previous section. To find the transformation laws of  under , we must first identify a set of generating  elements of  . For a generic surface,  is a blow-up of  at nine separated points. Hence, for a generic  one can choose  the nine exceptional divisors  and , the pre-image of a line in , as a set of generators for . Note that each of these exceptional curve is isomorphic to  and, hence, irreducible. Furthermore, the intersection numbers of  and  are given by
intersection 
e_ie_j =-_ij ,e_jl=0,ll=1,i,j=1,,9.
However, the rational elliptic surfaces we are going to consider are not generic. Rather, they are chosen to be in a restricted two dimensional sub-family. It can be shown that one effect of this restriction is to  collide together several of the nine points in . That is, not all of the nine points are distinct. The blow-ups of these degenerate points continue to contain exceptional curves , but their properties and  linear dependence are more complicated. It turns out that for surfaces  in the two dimensional sub-family,  and the nine curves  with intersection numbers (intersection ) still form a set of generators of . However, these curves are no longer  necessarily irreducible,  that is, they may consists of several components. This will be discussed in detail in Section basis .  This fact greatly complicates the process of determining their transformation laws under the  automorphisms. So much so, that it becomes necessary to use properties of rational elliptic surfaces not discussed inopr  or in the previous section.

To find the  transformation laws of  under , it is important to notice that, in addition to the fibration  discussed inopr  and Section rat ,  admits a second fibration 
: B 1 ,
where the generic fiber of  is isomorphic to  and not to a torus. This second fibration is very helpful in determining the  transformation laws since, first of all, its fibers turn out all to be invariant under the involution   and, secondly,  all curves  with exception of  are contained in some of its singular fibers.  This fibration is described in great detail in Section ruled . However, as a prerequisite, we need to prove the following property of . Recall from Section rat  that  is a four-fold cover, with mapping , of .  In this section, we will show that, viewed differently,  can actually be expressed as a double cover of another  surface, which we denote by . This result will then allow us to construct the fibration  .



We begin by analyzing the covering map   more closely. Recall from Section rat  that  is a double cover of  with covering map . By construction, the involution on  which is associated with this covering is . That is, . One refers to  as the covering involution of the map . Next we need to analyze  the covering involution on  associated with the map ? Determining this will afford us deeper insight into the structure of . To find this involution, first remember that
pi 

W_M [r]^  [d]_p _1  &  Q  [d]^p _1   [drr]-,  &&

P ^1  [r]_id   & P ^1  & & 

  
where the branch locus of  in  is . In addition, recall that the branch locus contains the image of the zero section, , of . It is clear from this and the structure of diagram (pi ) that  the covering involution on  of  must act as the identity on the base  and leave the zero section point-wise fixed. There is a unique  involution on  with this property. To see this, consider the involution  on  defined in Section rat . Clearly, this induces a unique involution   on  under the covering map . It is straightforward to see that  has the required properties and, hence, is the covering involution for . That is
QW_M/(-1)_W_M .
Combining this result with the discussion in Section rat , we see that  is a four-fold cover of  given by
l 

B[r]^-  &  W_MB/_B [r]^-   &  QW_M/(-1)_W_M . 
  
Note that  we have first modded out by  and then by . This is shown graphically as the left hand routing in Figure tricom .

Expressing  as the four-fold covering of   in this manner leads to the following important insight. Namely, note that it should not matter whether  we first  mod out by  and then by , the involution induced on  from , as in (l ),  or first mod out by  and then by the induced involution of  on . Either approach represents  as the same four-fold covering of . Let us specify this second decomposition of the covering more concretely. First, we denote
B/(-1)_BQ 
and the covering map associated with involution  by 
: B Q .
Now denote the induced involution of  on  by . Modding out  by  must produce a surface isomorphic to . That is,
Q /_Q  Q.
We write the associate covering map as 
: Q Q.
Combining these results, we see that the four-fold covering of  by  can be expressed  in an alternative manner to (l ) given by
m 

B[r]^-  &  Q B/(-1)_B [r]^-   &  QQ /_Q  . 
  
Here, we have first modded out by  and then by , which is induced from  on . This is shown graphically as the middle routing in Figure tricom .
Expressions (l ) and (m ) are not the only ways of writing  as the four-fold cover of . A third way is as follows. First mod out by the composite involution   on  to produce the surface 
B/((-1)_B_B)W_M^'  
and the covering map
^' :B W_M^'  .
Now denote the induced involution of  on  by . Modding out  by  must produce a surface isomorphic to . That is,
W_M^'  /(-1)_W_M^'   Q.
We write the associated covering map as
^' :W_M^'   Q.
Combining these results, we see that
r 

B[r]^-^'   &  W_M^'  B/((-1)_B_B) [r]^-^'    &  QW_M^'  /(-1)_W_M^'   , 
  
where we have first modded out by  and then by , which is induced from  on . This is shown graphically as the right hand routing in Figure tricom .

What are the branch loci of  in (l ),  in (m ) and  in (r )? The branch loci of  and  were discussed in the previous section and are pictured in the left hand routing of Figure tri-fg . Let us now discuss the branch loci  for  and , beginning with  . The covering involution for  is . Since  acts as the identity map on  and as  on , the composition  acts as  on  and as the identity map on . Hence, the branch locus for  in   consists of the image of the four fixed points under  on  and the fiber . Hence,  has similar properties to , one fiber   which contains four  surface singularities and which can be resolved into an  fiber, and three singular fibers which can be resolved into  fibers. The branch locus in  of the double cover  now clearly consists of the three  rulings  and , the  curve  and the image  of the fiber  in , which is a  ruling that we denote by . That explains the right hand routing of Figure tri-fg . Finally, we consider the branch loci of  and . Let us start with . To proceed,  we need to invoke a mathematical theorem which states that the branch locus of  in  consists of the union of the branch loci of  and  in  minus their intersection. Hence, the branch locus of  in  consists of the two  rulings  and . Now consider the covering map . To find its branch locus, we first must elucidate the structure of surface  more explicitly. To do this, recall that  has two natural projections  for  to the th  component. Choose any point  and consider the fiber  in . It is the double cover the fiber , which is isomorphic to , branched over the two points where  intersects the rulings  and . Hence  is isomorphic to . It follows that  is isomorphic to . That is
Q =1 1 .
We denote the two natural projections of  by  for .  Of course,  is smooth since the branch locus of  in  is smooth.

With this information, we can now determine  the branch locus of the  double cover . It is simply the pre-image under  of the curves  and . Since each of the rulings  and  pulls back to a unique fiber of , they are  rulings in . The pre-image of  is isomorphic to  as well, since  intersects the branch locus for  in two points, namely  and . However,  intersects the generic fiber of  at a point not contained in the branch locus of . Therefore, its pre-image  intersects the fiber  in two points. It follows that  is a bidegree  curve in . The branch loci for  and  are described in the middle routing of Figure tri-fg . This finishes our explanation of the branch loci of  as a degree four cover of . We have shown that there are three different ways of describing it, a fact that will prove to be important later when, for a chosen set of generating elements of , we try to compute their  transformation laws. 

We will finish this section with the proof that the sections  and   of  intersect each fiber  in a point of order two. This fact turned out to be crucial inopr  to construct commuting involutions on . First, it follows from the commutativity of Figure tricom  that
^-1 ^-1 =^-1 ^-1 .

But, we have shown in Section rat  that 
sec 
^-1 ^-1 (s),^-1 ^-1 (i),^-1 ^-1 (j),^-1 ^-1 (t^" )
correspond to sections of . Hence, 
^-1 ^-1 (s),^-1 ^-1 (i),^-1 ^-1 (j),^-1 ^-1 (t^" )
correspond to sections of . Secondly, recall from above that ,  and  are in the branch locus of 
: B Q B/(-1)_B.
Hence, the sections (sec ) are point-wise fixed under . Of course, this has to hold for the section  corresponding to  , since we had chosen  to be the zero section. In addition, this proves the invariance under  of the sections  and  corresponding to  and  respectively. Hence, these sections intersect each fiber  at a point of order two. Finally, since  is the last possible  section invariant under , this proves that  corresponds to . 

Studying the branch locus of  in , we see that the branch curve has six singularities. Hence, without resolving,  will have six  type singularities at the pre-image of these points. Thus, each section  and  contains two of these singularities. This is consistent with  the explanation in the previous section. Furthermore, the section    contains all six singularities. 









 as a Ruled Surface ruled 

In this section, we will show that  is a ruled surface. A ruled surface is a two dimensional fibration whose generic fiber is not a torus  but, rather,  . Expressing   as  a ruled surface  will  be very helpful in determining the transformation laws of the elements of  under the  automorphism group. Recall that B is elliptically fibered with respect to the mapping . This mapping is defined by  where 

sq: B [r]^-   & W_M [r]^ & Q [r]^p_1 & 1 , 

 
where  is the natural projection of  onto its first  factor.

Now recall that there is a second natural projection, namely,  where  is the second  factor of . Clearly, then, we can construct a second fibration of ,
delta1 
: B 1 ,
where 
and

: B [r]^-   & W_M [r]^ & Q [r]^p_2 & 1 . 

 
What is the generic fiber of the mapping ? To answer this, it is very helpful to use an alternative way that  covers , namely, the covering through the surface  given in (m ). This is expressed as the middle routing in  Figure tri-fg . Using the commutativity of Figure tricom , we can write
,
where now

: B [r]^-   & Q  [r]^ & Q [r]^p_2 & 1 . 

 
We showed in the previous section that for a generic ,  . Furthermore, note that if we identify  with  then . For a generic point , the fiber  intersects the branch locus of  in   only at two points, each contained in the bidegree  curve . This is indicated by the dashed line in Figure psibranch . Therefore, the double cover  of   is two  lines identified at two points and, hence,  is isomorphic to . But
1 ^-1 (p _2^-1 (x))=(p_2)^-1 (x)=^-1 (x)
is the generic fiber of (delta1 ). We conclude that  can be written as the fibration  whose generic fiber is  and, hence,  is a ruled surface. Note that the fiber of  is a degree four cover of the fiber of  or, equivalently, a degree two cover of the fiber of . Adopting the second point of view will simplify many calculations.

What are the singular fibers of ? First consider the three bidegree  curves  ,  and   in the branch locus of  in . These are shown in Figure psibranch , where we have defined ,  and .  Note that each of these curves is a   that intersects  at two points. Hence, the pre-image under  in  of each of these points must be blown-up to obtain a smooth surface. It follows that the pre-image under  of each  curve is a double  line intersecting two exceptional divisors in two distinct points. As discussed previously, we can identify these fibers as
e(n_1 n_2)=^-1 (a),e_6(n_3 n_4)=^-1 (b),e(n_5 n_6)=^-1 (c)
respectively. They are shown explicitly in Figure delta .

Are there other singular fibers of ? Consider the   curve  in . Clearly, under the projection  this curve is a degree one cover of  and, hence, 
4.9 
(^-1 (t^" ))=(1 )=2.
However, under the projection ,  is a degree two cover of . Then the Riemann-Hurwitz formula states that
4.10 
(^-1 (t^" ))=2(1 b_i)+A,
where  for  are the branch points of the simple ramification points of  over . By definition, above each ,  intersects  in only one point, not in two. At this point, the ramification point , the fiber  intersects  transversally. This is shown in Figure psibranch .

Therefore, the pre-image under  of each of   consists of two distinct  lines in  intersecting in a point. Note, however, that this point is smooth in . How many such fibers are there? Combining equations (4.9 ) and (4.10 ) we find
A=2.
We conclude that there are two such singular fibers,  for . Although not immediately obvious, we will show in the next section that one  component of  can be identified with , whereas one  component of  is . These two singular fibers are described in Figure delta .

In summary, we have shown that, in addition to the fibration  discussed inopr  and Section rat , there is a second way to fiber , namely, . The  fibers are generically  and, hence,  is a ruled surface. This second fibration has five
singular fibers, all shown explicitly in Figure delta . This fibration will be very helpful in identifying the set of generators of , which  will be done in the next section.



Generators of  basis 

Recall that a generic rational elliptic surfaces  is a   blown-up by a  at each of nine separate points. Furthermore, each of these  blown-up curves is an irreducible, exceptional divisor of  with self-intersection . We denote these nine exceptional divisors by , and have  shown that  and , where  is the pre-image of a line in , form a set of generators of . However, the rational elliptic surfaces  that we wish to consider are not generic. Rather, they form a restricted two-dimensional sub-family of such surfaces. One can show that, in this case, some of the nine points in  coalesce. This greatly obscures the construction of a surface  in this two dimensional sub-family as  a blow-up of a . In fact, as argued inopr  and Section rat , it is more convenient to obtain these surfaces by different means, namely, as the four-fold cover of  with a specific branch locus. Be that as it may, for surfaces in this two dimensional sub-family it is now essential that we exactly express  as a blow-up of . In doing this, we will explicitly identify nine divisors with self-intersection , which we again denote as , and give their structure in . These nine divisors, along with the pre-image of  a line  in , will again form the set of generators of . To proceed, we find it essential to use the  fibration  presented in the previous section.

To identify the rational elliptic surfaces  as a blow-up of , we need to invoke the so-called Castelnuovo-Enriques criterion. This involves a process called blow-down, the inverse of blowing-up. The Castelnuovo-Enriques criterion states that for any surface containing a  curve, that is, a curve isomorphic to  of self-intersection , one can blow down this curve and obtain a smooth surface. For more details on the Castelnuovo-Enriques criterion seegh .
To apply this process to the  surfaces of our two dimensional sub-family,  we must identify nine  curves and successively blow them down. To do this, recall  that the surface  can be considered as a ruled surface, that is
: B 1 
with the generic fiber of  being isomorphic to . We will denote the  class of such a fiber by . As discussed in Section ruled , this fibration has five singular fibers, each graphically described in Figure delta .  First, we consider the two singular fibers each of which consists of two  components which intersect in a single point. Choose one of these two fibers and denote its components by  and . Then, as homology classes
F=c_1 + c_2.
Note that here and henceforth,  and  denote the group operations in the homology group . These must not be confused with the addition and inverse of elements in , defined in Section rat , which, to distinguish them, were denoted using  and .
Recalling that for any fiber class , and using , we find
0=F^2=(c_1+ c_2)^2=c_1^2+2+c_2^2.
Since the components  and  are completely symmetric in , it follows that
c_1^2=c_2^2=-1.
Therefore, this singular fiber  contains two  curves. By the  Castelnuovo-Enriques criterion explained above, we can blow down either of them. Choose one component, for example , and shrink it to a point. What is the self-intersection of the remaining component? Since this component  now forms  a complete fiber of the fibration induced by  on the blown down surface, its self-intersection is zero. Hence, there is no longer any  curve in this fiber.  Of course, the second fiber of  consisting of two  components intersecting at a point did not get changed in the process of  blowing down. Therefore, it still admits two  curves, one of which can now be blown down. Hence, we have identified two  curves in  which can be blown down simultaneously. 

We now show that there are additional  curves in the remaining three singular fibers of . Start with the fiber containing the double component  and the two exceptional divisors  and . For a pictorial representation, we refer the reader to Figure delta . For this fiber we can write
F=2e_9+n_1+n_2.
Recall that we obtained  and  by blowing up two  surface singularities. Hence, blowing them down would not lead to a smooth surface. Therefore, by the Castelnuovo-Enriques criterion, neither exceptional divisor can  be a  curve. It can be shown, however, that, since they arise by blowing up  surface singularities, their self-intersection number is . 
Using this, and the fact that  intersects each of  and  in one point, we find that
0=(2e_9+n_1+n_2)^2=4e_9^2-2-2+2(2+2)
and, hence
e_9^2=-1.
Therefore, we can blow down  and obtain a smooth surface. What are the self-intersection numbers of the images of  and  in the blown down surface? Since this induced fiber in the blown down surface consists of two  components which intersect at one point, we are in the same situation as described above and can conclude that the image of each  of  and  in the blown down surface self-intersects as . Hence, we can pick one of them and blow it down.

Of course, the reasoning applied to the fiber  can be applied to the fibers  and . Therefore, the three singular fibers each containing a double component and two exceptional divisors allow us to blow down six  curves. Taking the previous two singular fiber of  into account as well, we have found eight  curves which can be simultaneously blown down. But since ,  we need to find one additional  curve to obtain a . Here, we will simply state a result proven indopr-i . 
Recall the map
: B Q ,

which is a double cover branched over the three  rulings , ,  and the  curve . Consider a  curve in  passing through one of the two intersection points of each of ,  and  . Specifically, we choose this curve to pass through the points whose pre-image under  blows-up to  and  respectively. It can be shown that such a curve in  exists and that its proper transform in  is a  curve which is a section of the fibration .  We denote this  curve by . 

We are finally in a position to construct our restricted surface  as a blow-up of . In the process, we will specifically identify, and give the properties of, nine  curves in . To do this, begin with one such surface .
First, consider the two singular fibers of  each consisting of two components. Denote by  the component of one of these fibers which does not intersect  and by  the component of the other fiber which does not intersect . Blow them down. Next, blow the  curves  and  down. Continuing, blow the images of the curves  and  down. Note that none of the curves  or  intersects . Finally, upon blowing down  we obtain . Of the curves  and , all are  curves with the exception of  and . In addition, some of the -type and -type curves intersect. This motivates us to define
def1 
e_3=e_4+n_5,e_5=e_6+n_3,e_8=e_9+n_1.
It is straightforward to verify that each of  and  are  curves and that  are all non-intersecting.  To reiterate, if we start with a restricted surface  and blow down the curves  and  we obtain a . Reversing the process, we have constructed  as the blow-up of a  surface, as desired.

If we denote by  the pull back of a curve on , then  and  form a set of generators for  with the same intersection numbers as given in (intersection ). That is,
H_2(B,Z )=Z l(_i=1 ^9 Z e_i).
Therefore, we have successfully described a set of generators of the curve homology of  in terms of the nine  curves and the pre-image of a  line in . Note that this motived our original choice inopr  and Section rat  to name the two non-zero sections of order two as  and . 

In this basis, the components of the  fibers can be written as
def 
split 
n_1  & = e_8  - e_9  

o_1  & = f - e_8  + e_9  

n_2  & = l - e_7  - e_8  - e_9  

o_2  & = 2l - e_1  - e_2  - e_3  - e_4  - e_5  - e_6 

n_3  & = e_5  - e_6  

o_3  & = f - e_5  + e_6  

n_4  & = l - e_7  - e_6  - e_5  

o_4  & = 2l - e_1  - e_2  - e_3  - e_4  - e_8  - e_9 

n_5  & = e_3  - e_4  

o_5  & = f - e_3  + e_4  

n_6  & = l - e_7  - e_4  - e_3  

o_6  & = 2l - e_1  - e_2  - e_5  - e_6  - e_8  - e_9 .

split 
where  is the fiber class of the elliptic fibration .
Let us make a remark on these equations. The expressions for  and  follow easily from (def1 ). To understand the expressions for  and ,  observe the following. Take, for example, . It is the component of the singular fiber of  intersecting  which is left after blowing down  and . Hence, the image of  in  must be . It follows that   in  is given by  reduced by the exceptional divisors  and . That is
n_2=l-2e_9-e_7-n_1,
which is the expression given in (def ). The equations for  and  are derived in a similar way.  Once we have defined , the proper transforms  are given by  .  Recall from Section rat  that the fiber class  is . Note that the section  intersects   and . 
Finally, even through  and  form a canonical set of generators, the set ,  and  also generates  . We will use these two sets of generators interchangeably depending on the context.
 





Transformations under  -1 

In the following sections, we will determine the transformation laws of the elements of  under the involutions  and  defined in Section rat .
To determine these transformations, we will use both the elliptic fibration , whose fiber we continue to call , and the ruling , whose fiber we continue to call . We will also need all three descriptions of   shown in Figure tri-fg . In this section, for completeness and to establish methodology,  we will determine the induced action of  on  .

To begin, observe that 
-f 
(-1)_B (f)=f.
This is clear since  acts fiber-wise on the elliptic fibration. In addition, note that
-F 
(-1)_B (F)=F.
This follows from the fact that  is the covering involution for  and  is the double cover of the  line , where  is the second natural projection of , namely, .

Now consider the two singular fibers of  containing the sections  and  respectively. Choose one of them, say the fiber containing . As discussed above, this fiber can be written as
F=e_1+c_2,
where  intersects . Since this fiber arises as the pre-image under  of a single  line which intersects the branch locus of  in  at a single point, it follows that  and  must be exchanged under . That is,
c_2=(-1)_B(e_1).
Exactly the same statement is true for the singular fiber containing . Therefore, the homology class of the fiber  can be written as
1 
F=e_i +(-1)_B (e_i),i=1,2.
Note that this is consistent with the expression (-F ). Now consider a generic fiber of . On might imagine that  would be the class of this fiber. However, it is clear from the previous discussion that the generic fiber must intersect  at a single point. Using the intersections   and , we see that the fiber class can be written as 
2 
F=l-e_7.
Note that it follows from  (-F ) that
l-e 
(-1)_B(l-e_7)=l-e_7.
From (1 ) and (2 ), we conclude  that
(-1)_B (e_i)=l-e_7-e_i,i=1,2. 
Next consider the six exceptional divisors . Since the image under  of the six surface singularities in   are contained in the branch locus of  in , it follows that the six exceptional divisors  are fixed under . That is
-n 
(-1)_B(n_i)=n_i,i=1,,6.
Recall that the proper transforms are  defined to be  for . Then, it follows from (-f ) and (-n ) that
(-1)_B(o_i)=o_i,i=1,,6.
The sections  and  are invariant under  by definition. Applying these results to the sections  and  defined in (def1 ) using the linearity of , the invariance of  and  and (-n ), we find, for example, that
(-1)_B(e_3)=(-1)_B(e_4 +n_5)=e_4 +n_5=e_3.
Similarly, it follows that
(-1)_B(e_5)=e_5,(-1)_B(e_8)=e_8.
Finally, using  given in (def ), the fact that  and the invariance of  and  under , it follows that
-l 
(-1)_B(l)=2l-(e_1+e_2+e_7).
Furthermore, from (l-e ) and (-l ) we find 
(-1)_B(e_7)=l-(e_1+e_2).
This completes the analysis for the action of  on the set of generators   and  of . These results are summarized in Table tab(-1) . The transformation of an arbitrary class in  follows immediately from these results.

The Action of  alpha 

In this section, we begin our analysis of the transformations of  the elements of  under  and .  Recalling from (inv ) that  and , we start by finding the action of  on . First, observe that
af 
_B(f)=f.
This follows from the fact that  preserves the fiber of the elliptic fibration . The commutativity of Figure tri-fg  implies that . Since  is the covering involution for map , this shows that the  fiber class of  is also invariant under . That is,
aF 
_B(F)=F.
Let us first discuss the generic representation of  given in (2 ). Then this and (aF ) imply that under 
_B(l-e_7)=l-e_7.
Now, consider the singular fiber  of . Note that  exchanges the two surface singularities in   which blow up into  and . Hence,  exchanges  and . That is, 
n1 
_B(n_1)=n_2,_B(n_2)=n_1.
Since, by (aF ),  must be invariant under , it follows that
_B(e_9)=e_9.
Similar remarks hold for the singular fibers  and . We see, therefore,  that
n3 
_B(n_3)=n_4, _B(n_4)=n_3
and  
n4 
_B(n_5)=n_6, _B(n_6)=n_5.
Combining this with the invariance of both singular fibers under , we conclude that
a6 
_B(e_6)=e_6,_B(e_4)=e_4.
Next consider  the proper transform  for . Then  it follows from (af ), (n1 ), (n3 ) and (n4 ) that
_B(o_2j-1 )=o_2j ,_B(o_2j )=o_2j-1 
for . It is easy to read off the transformation laws for   and  defined in (def1 ). For example, using (n4 ), (a6 ) and (def ) we see that
a3 
_B(e_3)=_B(e_4 +n_5)=e_4 +n_6=l-e_3-e_7.
Similarly, we have
a5 
_B(e_5)=_B(e_6 +n_3)=e_6 +n_4=l-e_5-e_7
and
a8 
_B(e_8)=_B(e_9 +n_1)=e_9 +n_2=l-e_7-e_8.
Let us now discuss the transformation law of the sections  and . Each of these is  contained  in one of the two singular fibers of  consisting of two components. Consider either one of these singular fibers. Since it must be stable under ,  can either exchange its two components or leave them invariant. To answer this question, we must analyze these two fibers of  more closely. By definition, these fibers are double covers of the  rulings in  which intersect the  curve  tangentially. It is easy to see that these  rulings in  are double covers of the two  rulings in  with pass  through either  or . Let us assume that  is contained in the fiber of  corresponding to the degree four cover of the  ruling in  which passes through the point . It follows that  is contained in the fiber of  corresponding to the degree four cover of the  ruling in  which passes through the point . From the commutativity of  Figure tri-fg , we can discuss these two fibers of  using the relation . To determine the transformation law of , consider the  ruling in  which passes through . This ruling intersects the branch divisor of the map  at two different points. Hence, its double cover in  is a smooth . This curve intersects the branch divisor of  at a single point in  in . Therefore, its pre-image in  consists of two components which are exchanged by the covering involution for  and, hence, by . Since one of the two components is ,
F= e_1+_B(e_1)
represents the class of a full fiber of . It follows from this and (2 ) that
e_1+_B(e_1)=l-e_7,
or equivalently
a1 
_B(e_1)=l-e_1-e_7.
What about the fiber of   containing ? Consider the   ruling in  which passes through . This is the only point where this ruling intersects the branch locus of  in . Hence, the pre-image of this ruling in  consists of two components, both isomorphic to . What is the pre-image of these two  lines in ? Since each component intersects the branch locus of  in two points, namely its intersection with  and the point  in , the pre-image of each component is a smooth . Clearly, these components are not exchanged under the covering involution of  and, hence, under . One of the components we called . Therefore,
a2 
_B(e_2)=e_2.


Finally,  solving the equations  and  using (df ), (def ), (a6 ), (a3 ), (a5 ), (a1 ) and (a2 ),  we obtain 
_B(l)=3l-e_1-e_3-e_5-2e_7-e_8
and
_B(e_7)=2l-e_1-e_3-e_5-e_7-e_8.
This concludes our calculation of the transformation laws of the canonical set of generators of  under . The results are summarized in Table tab(al) . The action of  on any class in  follows immediately from these results.

The Action of  and  trans 

In this section, we complete the analysis of the transformations of the elements of  under  and  by computing the actions of  and . We will proceed in several steps, first computing the transformations of the  fiber components  and  for  and then using these results to find the transformations of the canonical set of generators of .


The Action of  and  on Fiber Components 

Recall that  and  preserve the fibers of the elliptic fibration . That is 
t6f 
t_e_6 (f)=f,t_e_4 (f)=f.
As discussed in Section rat , any surface  in the restricted two parameter family has six single  fibers. Each such  fiber is composed of two  components,  and , intersecting at two singular points. This is shown in Figure I2 . That is, the  singular fibers of  can be written as . The relationship of these fiber components to the canonical set of generators  and  of  was given in (def ). It follows from these remarks and (t6f ) that the action of  and  either exchanges the two components of an  fiber or leaves them invariant. The remainder of this sub-section is devoted to deciding which of these possibilities occur.




We begin our analysis with the first  fiber, defined as , and consider the action on it of . Recall that each smooth fiber of  admits an Abelian group structure whose identity element is the point of  intersection of the fiber with the zero section .  It can be shown that, after removing the two singular points, each   fiber also carries an Abelian group structure. Using (def ) and the intersection numbers of the canonical set of generators of , we see that
 n_1e=1,o_1e=0. 
Hence, the identity element is in the  component. In addition, note that
n_1e_6=0,o_1e_6=1. 
These results are represented pictorially in  Figure tn1 .

Now consider a specific point on , which we choose to be the identity element  . Translating this point by  gives
t_6(n_1e)=(n_1o_1)e_6=o_1e_6,
which is a point in . If follows the  must exchange  and . That is
t_e_6 (n_1)=o_1,t_e_6 (o_1)=n_1.
It is straightforward to see that  will exchange the components of any  fiber for which  and  intersect different components, as in Figure tn1 .

What happens for an  fiber for which  and  intersect the same component? As an example, consider  the fifth  fiber defined as . Using (def ) and the intersection numbers of the canonical set of generators of , it is easy to show that
n_5 e= n_5e_6=0
and 
o_5 e= o_5e_6=1.
Here, the identity element is in the  component.  These results are represented in  Figure tn5 .
Again, consider the zero element . Translating this point by  gives
t_e_6 (o_5e)=(n_5o_5)e_6= o_5e_6,
which remains a point in . We conclude that  leaves  and  stable. That is 
t_e_6 (n_5)=n_5,t_e_6 (o_5)=o_5.
Clearly, this will be the case for any  fiber for which  and  intersect the same component, is in Figure tn5 .

It is easy now to derive the remaining transformation laws of  and  for  under  and . From (def ) one can read off the intersection numbers of the various  fiber components with  and . By the above remarks, it is then straightforward to determine the transformation laws of the fiber components under  and . We summarize our findings in Table tI2 , where we also specify the action of the  compositions  and  on  and  for . To do the latter, we combine the results of this section with those of Section alpha .

Transformations of the Canonical Generators under  

Having found the action of  and  on the fiber components, we now use these results to compute the  transformation laws of the canonical set of generators of  under each translation. In this sub-section, we consider the action of . Some of these laws are easy to read off, others are more complicated. Let us begin with the easy ones.
First, it follows from the definition of a translation, and the fact that  is the zero section, that
4.1 
t_e_6 (e_9)=e_9. +  e_6=e_6.
Furthermore, since  is a section of order two, we have
4.2 
t_e_6 (e_6)=e_6. +  e_6=e_9.
With help of (4.1 ), (4.2 ) and Table tI2 , it is now straightforward to determine the transformation laws of  and . Using, in addition, (def1 ), the definition of  for  and (def ), we find that
t_e_6 (e_5 ) = t_e_6 (e_6  + n_3 ) = e_6 + o_3 = e_9+f-n_3 = f-e_5+e_6+e_9
and
t_e_6 (e_8 ) = t_e_6 (e_9  + n_1 ) = e_6 + o_1 = e_6+f-n_1 = f+e_6-e_8+e_9.To find the transformation laws of  and  under , however, we need to exploit the relationship between elements in  and line bundles which, until now, was unnecessary. First, by Poincare duality, we have a canonical isomorphism
H_2(B,Z )H^2(B,Z ).
Furthermore, it can be shown that on a  simply connected smooth surface
H^2(B,Z )Pic(B),
where  is the space of all line bundles up to isomorphism on . Hence, we obtain
H_2(B,Z )Pic(B).
More explicitly, for any element , we have
O _B().
What is the relationship between an involution   on  and its action on ? To answer this, consider a class  and its associated line bundle . If  is an involution on , then we can  define  the pull-back bundle, , under  which satisfies the commutative diagram 

^* O _B() [r]^-_2 [d]_-^'   & O _B()[d]^-    [drr]-.  && 

B [r]^-  &  B &&
 
Map  takes the fiber  to the fiber  for all points . As is, the bundle  is abstractly defined. However, one can identify  more concretely, as we now show. We will assume that the class in  can be represented by a curve, which we also call . This implies that  has a section 
s: B O _B()
whose vanishing locus is on , that is, . Now consider the map
s^' : B ^* O _B()
defined by
_2s^' =s.
Then, it is clear that  is a section of  satisfying 
s^' (^-1 ())=0.
Hence, the curve, or homology cycle, representing  is . That is,
^* O _B () O _B(^-1 ())O _B(()),
where we have used the fact that, since  is an involution, . We can now answer the above question definitely. The action  of an involution on  induces the action
mappic 
O _B()O _B(^-1 ())O _B(())
on . We will use this relationship to determine the transformation laws of  and  under translations.

To do this, we first need to review some relevant facts about line bundles. Recall that  is an elliptic fibration . We want to discuss the group structure of both the smooth elliptic fibers, , and the space of sections, , in terms of line bundles on  and  respectively. First, we consider a smooth elliptic curve  with a fixed zero point, which we call . Each point  determines a line bundle, namely
p O _T^2 (p),
which is of degree one since it is defined by a single point. This specifies a map , where   is the space of degree one line bundles on  up to isomorphism. Note that since  is not closed under tensor product multiplication, it does not form a group. However, exploiting the fact that we have a marked point , we can, alternatively, define a map for each point  to a degree zero line bundle, namely
p O _T^2 (p-e).
 is of degree zero since it is defined as the difference of two points. This specifies a map , which can be shown to be an isomorphism.  is the space of all degree zero line bundles on  up to isomorphism. It is clear that the bundle associated to the zero point  under this map is the trivial bundle. Furthermore,  is closed under tensor product multiplication and forms a group. Note that the map  is a group homomorphism. This means that for any given three points  which obey
p. +  p^' =p^" ,
we have
O _T^2 (p-e)O _T^2 (p^' -e)O _T^2 (p^" -e).
Thus far, we have considered points in a smooth fiber .
Using the zero section  of , we can try to extend our discussion to a family of elliptic curves, that is, to sections of our elliptic fibration . Consider any section  in . We can, as mentioned above, define a map
0a 
O _B().
This specifies a map from . But similarly to the discussion above, we can, alternatively, use the zero section  to  define, for any section , the mapping
O _B(This map has a similar property to the case of one elliptic curve. That is, for any three sections  which obey
a 
. +  ^' =^" 
we have 
b 
O _B(O _B(^' -e)_f= O _B(^" -e)_f,
where the equation only holds for the restriction to any smooth fiber .  However, care has to be taken at the singular fibers.

Let us now calculate the class  for any section . To do this,  we have to  calculate the line bundle , as discussed in (mappic ). Using the map (0a ), this line bundle corresponds to the section
. +  (. -  e_6)=. -  e_6=t^-1 _e_6 ().
Using equations (a ) and (b ), we find that
great 
 O _B(O ^-1 _B(e_6-e)_f=O _B(t_e_6 ^-1 ()-e)_f
where we have used  as the second factor since, in this case, .
Tensoring (great ) with  gives an equation in terms of divisors, namely
4.5 
t_e_6 ()= - e_6  + e_9 +
a_1 n_1  + a_2 n_2  + a_3 n_3 + a_4 n_4 + a_5 n_5 + a_6 n_6 + a_0f,
where  are integers. Note that this equation holds for both smooth and singular fibers. It even holds  without restriction to any fiber at all.  We have assured this by adding the fiber components. The specific coefficients  will now be determined.

To begin with, intersect both sides of (4.5 ) with the exceptional divisors  for . Taking into account the results of Table tI2 , that is,  , , the intersection numbers and the fact that , we obtain 
split 
o_1&= n_1+1 -2a_1 

o_2&= n_2+1 -2a_2  

o_3&= n_3-1 -2a_3  

o_4&= n_4-1 -2a_4  
 
n_5&= n_5-2a_5  

n_6&= n_6-2a_6.  

split 
Hence, 
a_5=a_6=0
independently of the choice of section . Recall that  and  are sections of , that is, they intersect each  fiber exactly once. Furthermore,   and  intersect none of the exceptional divisors, the only exceptional divisors which are intersected by  are  and , and   intersects only  and . Using these facts, we can determine the coefficients  for  and . The results are presented in the first four columns of Table te6exept . Note that these coefficients are identical for  and , but differ for .

Squaring this expression then tells us that

t_e_6 (e_i)=f-l+e_i+e_6+e_7+e_9i=1,2,4,
where we used the definition of  and  in term of the sections  and  given in (def ). Similarly, using the expansion of  determined by (4.5 ) and  Table te6exept , we find that  for . Hence,

Finally, using the transformation laws of  and  it is easy to read off the transformation of . We find that
t_e_6 (l)=2f-e_5+2e_6+e_7-e_8+2e_9.
A general summary of our findings for  is presented in Table table-auts .


Transformations of the Canonical Generators under  

The calculation of the transformation laws of the canonical set of generators of  under  closely follows the calculation of the transformations under  . First, we determine the transformations of  and . Using the definition of a translation, and the facts that  is the zero section and that  is a section of order two, we find
g 
t_e_4 (e_9 )=e_9. +  e_4 =e_4 
and
f 
t_e_4 (e_4)  = e_4 . +   e_4  = e_9 .
Using this, (def ) and Table tI2 , it follows that
t_e_4 (e_8 ) = t_e_4 (e_9  + n_1 ) = e_4 + o_1 = e_4+f-n_1 = f+e_4-e_8+e_9
and
t_e_4 (e_3 ) = t_e_4 (e_4  + n_5 ) = e_9 + o_5 = e_9+f-n_3 = f-e_3+e_4+e_9.
To finish our calculation of the transformation laws of the canonical set of generators of  under , we have to use a formula similar to (4.5 ) which, for , is given by
te4 
t_e_4 () = - e_4  + e_9  + a_1 n_1  + a_2 n_2  + a_3 n_3 + a_4 n_4 + a_5 n_5 + a_6 n_6 + a_0f.
To determine the coefficients for specific sections , we  intersect both sides of (te4 ) with  for .  Taking into account the results of Table tI2 , that is,  for  and  for , we obtain
split 
o_1&= n_1+1 -2a_1 

o_2&= n_2+1 -2a_2  

n_3&= n_3-2a_3  

n_4&= n_4-2a_4  
 
o_5&= n_5-1 -2a_5  

o_6&= n_6-1 -2a_6.  

split 
Hence, 
a_3=a_4=0
independently of the section . Recall that  and  are sections, that is, they intersect each  fiber exactly once. Furthermore,   and  intersect none of the exceptional divisors and  the only exceptional divisors which are intersected by  are  and .

We now want to find all classes in  that are invariant under the  automorphism group. Let us denote the subspace of all such invariant classes by . We will show indopr-ii  that 
rankinv 
H_2(B,Z )^inv =4.
Hence, there exist four generators of . One of these generators is trivial to find, namely
f=3l-_i=1 ^9 e_i.
This follows from the first line of Table table-auts , which reflects the statement, shown inopr , that  is preserved by any automorphism of .

A second invariant generator, consisting only of fiber components of , is also easy to find. We see using Table tI2  that
n_1+o_2
is preserved under the  automorphism group. Using (def ), this can be expressed in  terms of the canonical set of generators as
n_1+o_2=2l-e_1-e_2-e_3-e_4-e_5-e_6+e_8-e_9.
To find the third invariant generator, we exploit the fact that, for any , the class
txi 
+_B1 ()+_B2 ()+_B1 _B2 ()
is invariant under . Choosing , we take as the third generator of 
ie_9+_B1 (e_9)+_B2 (e_9)+_B1 _B2 (e_9).
Using the results in Table table-auts , we find that
invi 
i=2e_6+2e_4-n_1+o_2.
This can be expressed in terms of the canonical basis as
i=2l-e_1-e_2-e_3+e_4-e_5+e_6-e_8+e_9.
Finally, we find the fourth invariant generator as a result of enlightened trial and error. The result is
invM 
M2e_2-2e_9-n_1-n_2,
which, using (def ), can be written as
M=-l+2e_2+e_7.
The invariance of  under  is easily checked using the results in Table table-auts . It is straightforward to show that  and  are linearly independent classes.  We conclude that

This choice of generators will turn out to be very convenient when we solve the numerical conditions on the rank four vector bundles  on the Calabi-Yau space  imposed by particle physics phenomenologydopr-iii,dopr-ii . Note that it is very easy to find other invariant classes in . For example, it is immediately obvious from Table tI2  that  is an invariant class. Furthermore, as we stated, (txi ) is an invariant class for any . However, it follows from (rankinv ) and the linear independence of  and  that any other invariant class must be a linear combination of these four generator classes. For example, one  easily  finds using (def ) that
n_2+o_1=2f-(n_1+o_2).

The Homology of  and  XZ 

Recall fromopr  and Section Z  that our analysis involves  two different types of Calabi-Yau threefolds. The first are the Calabi-Yau spaces  which are simply connected and admit a freely acting automorphism group . The second are the smooth quotient spaces
11.1 
Z=X/(Z _2Z _2)
with fundamental group . In this section, we will calculate the relevant parts of the homology rings  and  of these two types of threefolds. More precisely, we will  first determine
poinc 
_C  H_i (X,C )=_C  (H_i (X,Z )C ),i=0,,6
and then show how to find a set of generators of . A subset of these generators consists of classes that are invariant under the action of . These span the subgroup of invariant homology classes, which we denote by . We will explicitly compute a complete set of invariant generators. Using these results, we  then determine
_C  H_i (Z,C )= _C ( H_i (Z,Z )C ),i=0,,6
and explicitly find a set of generators of . Both quantities, the dimensions of  and the generators of , are of physical importance. The dimension of the homology groups of  are a vital ingredient in determining the particle spectrum of string theories compactified on the Calabi-Yau threefold . The elements of  are divisors in  which clearly descend, via the modding out (11.1 ), from the invariant divisors on , that is, the elements of . The classes in   will be used indopr-i  anddopr-ii  to construct invariant stable vector bundles on  which, in turn, descend to stable vector bundles on . These bundles admit connections which correspond to solutions of the hermitian Yang-Mills equations on .

Let us begin with the Calabi-Yau threefold . It is convenient to use Poincare duality, that is
H_i(X,Z )H^6-i (X,Z ),0=1,,6.
Furthermore, the fact that  is a  Kahler manifold allows us to write the  Hodge diamond of  as in Figure HX . Here
hij 
h^a,b _X=_C H_  ^a,b (X),a,b=0,,3
denotes the dimension of the -th Dolbeaux cohomology of holomorphic -forms on .

It is well-known that for Kahler manifolds
H^k (X,C )=_a+b=k H_  ^a,b (X)
and, therefore, that

For  simply connected Calabi-Yau threefolds, the Hodge diamond simplifies to the highly symmetric form given in  Figure hCY . Hence, to determine the dimension of the homology groups of , we need to determine  and  only. To do this, we begin by calculating the elements of  explicitly.

Since  is simply connected, we have
12.10 
H_  ^1,1 (X)Pic(X)C H^2(X,Z )C .
Therefore, if we can determine  the generators of all line bundles on , we will have determined all generators of  and, hence, of . Recall that  is the fiber product of two rational elliptic surfaces  and . Hence, we have the inclusion map
i: B _1   B^'  B B^' .
In terms of cohomology, this defines the pull-back map
i^* : H^2(BB^' ,Z  ) H^2(B _1   B^' ,Z  ).
Using the Kunneth formula, we find
H^2(BB^' ,Z  )H^2(B,Z )H^2(B^' ,Z ).
With the help of the the isomorphisms
H^2(B_1   B^' ,Z  )Pic(B_1   B^' ),H^2(B,Z  )Pic(B),H^2( B^' ,Z  )Pic(B^' ),
we have
Pic 
i^* :Pic(B) Pic(B^' ) Pic(B _1   B^' ).
To see how the map  works, recall that for  we had the natural projections
equation 

& X [dl]_-[dr]^-  &&  [ddr]-.  & 

B [dr]_-  & & B' [dl]^-

& 1  &&&&
 
equation 
Consider any line bundle  on  determined by the divisor . That is,
L=(D).
Then, clearly
^'* L=^'* (D)=(^'-1 (D))=(D_1  B^' ).
Similarly, for a line bundle  on  determined by the divisor , that is
L^' =(D^' ),
we obtain
^* L^' =^* (D^' )=(^-1 (D^' ))=(B_1  D^' ).
Hence, the map (Pic ) is given by
LL 
i^* :(L,L^' )^'* L ^* L^' .
It is not to difficult to show that the map  is surjective, that is, all line bundles on  arise from line bundles on  and  via (LL ). But what is the kernel of ? It follows from  (LL ) that  will be in the kernel of  if and only if 
^'* L=(^* L^' )^-1 .
Hence, the divisors  and  associated with  and  respectively must satisfy
11.21 
^'-1 (D)=-^-1 (D^' ).
This can only happen if  and  are pull-back bundles from  of the form
L=^* (a),L^' =^'* (-a),a Z .
Then
^'* L=(a(ff^' )),^* L^' =(-a(ff^' ))
and, hence, (11.21 ) is satisfied.
Noting that  spans , it follows that
gh2 
H^2 (X,Z )Pic(B _1  B^' )Pic(B)Pic(B^' ) Pic(1 ) H^2 (B,Z )H^2 (B^' ,Z )   H^2 (1 ,Z ) .
This result allows us to determine all of the relevant quantities on , namely, the Hodge numbers  and the generators of  .

First consider the Hodge numbers. Using (hij ), (12.10 ), (gh2 ) and the fact that , we find
h11 
h^1,1 _X=_C  H^1,1 _  (X)=_C  H^2 (X,C ) =10+10-1=19.
To determine ,  note that for complex threefolds the topological Euler characteristic can be calculated as
(X)=_i=0 ^6 (-1)^i _C H^i(X,C ) .
Furthermore, it can be shown that
(X)=c_3(X).
But, as discussed inopr , . Using this and the Hodge diamond of Figure hCY ,  we find
0=(X)=1+h^1,1 _X-1-2h^2,1 _X-1+h^1,1 _X+1.
It then follows, using (h11 ), that
h^2,1 =19.
Note that using (kahler ), the Hodge diamond of Figure hCY  and  we can determine  and, hence, by Poincare duality  for all .
 
Now, recall from Poincare duality (poinc ) that
H_4(X,Z )H^2(X,Z ).
Using this and (gh2 ), we can determine the nineteen generators of . First, note that if  is a divisor in , that is, , then
12.33 
^'-1 (D)=D_1   B^'  H_4(X,Z ).
Similarly, if  then
12.34 
^-1 (D^' )=B_1   D^'  H_4(X,Z ).
Taking  to be the canonical set of generators  of  and  to be  in , we see from (gh2 ) that the set
12.35 
D_1   B^' ,B_1   D^' 
generates . Note that there are only nineteen, and not twenty, classes in (12.35 ) since
12.36 
f_1  B^' =B_1   f^' =ff^' .
This is the reason for the  denominator in (gh2 ). We conclude that (12.35 ), subject to (12.36 ), gives an explicit set of nineteen generators of .

So far, we have analyzed the Hodge diamond and fourth homology group of the Calabi-Yau threefold . We now turn our attention to the Calabi-Yau threefold  defined in (11.1 ). Here, given the previous results, it is easiest to proceed in reverse, first determining the generators of   and then the Hodge numbers. To to this, note that any class in  must descend under modding out from a  invariant class in . If we denote the subspace of invariant classes by , then there exists an isomorphism
H_4(X,Z )^inv H_4(Z,Z ).
What are the generators of ? Recall from (invX ) that the generators of the   automorphism group on  are
_Xi =_Bi  _1  _B^' i ,i=1,2.
Acting with these involutions on (12.33 ) and (12.34 ) we have 
12.38 
_Xi (D _1   B^' )=_Bi (D)_1   B^' 
and  
12.39 
_Xi (B _1   D^' )=B _1   _B^' i (D^' )
respectively for . It follows from (12.38 ) that  will be in  if and only if
_Bi (D)=D,i=1,2.
That is, if and only if
D H_2(B,Z )^inv .
From the results of the previous section, we know that the classes  and  given in (iM ) generate . Similarly, it follows from (12.39 ) that  will be in  if and only if
_B^' i (D^' )=D^' ,i=1,2.
That is
D^'  H_2(B^' ,Z )^inv ,
which is generated by the classes  and  given in (iM' ). It is clear, then, that a set of generators of  is given by
12.44 
D_inv _1   B^' ,B _1   D_inv ^' ,
where
D_inv =f, n_1+o_2, i, M
and
D_inv ^' =f^' , n^' _1+o^' _2, i^' , M^' .
Note that it follows from (12.36 ) that there are only seven, not eight, classes in (12.44 ). Another convenient way of writing the generators (12.44 ) is as
^'-1 (f),^'-1 (n_1+o_2),^'-1 (i),^'-1 (M),^-1 (n_1^' +o_2^' ),^-1 (i^' ),^-1 (M^' ).
These classes all descend under the modding out of  by  to form a set of seven generators of . We conclude that 
H_4(Z, Z )=7
and, therefore, that  admits the homology classes required to produce anomaly free, three family particle physics theories.

The Hodge diamond of the Calabi-Yau threefold .

figure 
From this result, it is straightforward to compute the Hodge numbers of . First, note that
12.47 
H_  ^1,1 (Z)H^2(Z,Z )C H_4(Z,Z )C .
Then,
12.48 
h^1,1 _Z=_C  H_  ^1,1 (Z)= _C  H_4(Z,C )=H_4(Z,Z )^inv =7.
The remaining Hodge number, , can be computed using
(Z)=_i=0 ^6  (-1)^i _C H^i(Z,C ),
the fact that
(Z)=c_3(Z)=c_3(X) 4 =0
and the structure of the Hodge diamond. We find that
0=1+h^1,1 _Z-1-2h^2,1 _Z-1+h^1,1 _Z+1
which, using (12.48 ), implies 
h^2,1 _Z=7.
Therefore, the Hodge diamond of  has the form given in  Figure hZ . Using this, Poincare duality and (kahler ) it is now easy to read off the dimensions of  for .
