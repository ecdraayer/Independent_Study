We compute the graviton two scalar off-shell interaction vertex at tree level in 
Type IIB superstring theory on the pp-wave background using the light-cone
string field theory formalism. We then show that the tree level vertex 
vanishes when all particles are on-shell and conservation of  and 
 are imposed. We reinforce our claim by calculating the same 
vertex starting from the corresponding SUGRA action expanded around the 
pp-wave background in the light-cone gauge.

Introduction 
In   it was conjectured that there exists a duality between the
Type IIB string theory on  and  super Yang Mills theory
on the boundary of . A concrete recipe for verifying this correspondence 
in the large  limit when 
 was given in There have been 
many checks of this duality in the supergravity () 
limit but the verification of the correspondence in the full string theory 
remains elusive. In a more recent development, the authors of 
showed that in the Penrose
limit the  background turns into the pp-wave solution of
Type IIB supergravity preserving all 32 supercharges
ds^2=-4dx^+ dx^- -^2x_Ix_I(dx^+ )^2
+dx_Idx_I,F_+1234 =F_+5678 =2, 
where .
Unlike the case of , where we do not even know the free string 
spectrum, string theory on the pp-wave background can be solved 
in the light-cone gauge, despite the presence of a non-zero Ramond-Ramond flux. 
Partly motivated by the conjecture in  , Berenstein, Maldacena and 
Nastase   have argued that a particular sector of  super 
Yang Mills theory containing operators with large R-charge J is dual to Type IIB 
string theory on the pp-wave background with Ramond-Ramond flux. The fact that 
string theory on the pp-wave background has been exactly solved has opened an 
exciting possibility to check the proposed correspondence beyond the supergravity 
limit. In fact, the authors of   succeeded in reproducing the tree level 
string spectrum on the pp-wave   from the perturbative super Yang Mills 
theory as the first test of a full string theory/CFT duality. The anomalous 
dimensions of the BMN operators arising from the Yang-Mills perturbation theory 
were studied in to check the correspondence between strings
on the plane wave background and the Yang-Mills theory at the level of perturbative 
expansions. In a separate development, Spradlin and Volovich generalized the 
formalism of the light-cone string field theory in Minkowski space 
to the plane-wave geometry The subject of the pp-wave
light-cone string field theory pioneered by SV in was studied 
further in The factorization theorem for the Neumann coefficients was discussed in 
and explicit formulas for the Neumann coefficients were 
derived in  . By employing the formalism of  
certain three-string amplitudes  were found to be in agreement with the corresponding
three-point functions of the BMN operators with large R charge  , 
A cubic light-cone interaction Hamiltonian for the chiral 
primary system  from the Type IIB pp-wave supergravity  was constructed 
in  ,  .
Another interesting question is the issue of existence of the 
-matrix interpretation for field theories on the plane wave backgrounds.
The authors of   have demonstrated that, at least at the tree level, 
the field theory of scalars and scalars coupled to a gauge field do have
an -matrix formulation.

The motivation behind this paper is brought about by the fact that, unlike in
the flat Minkowski space, the stringy modes do not decouple from the supergravity
modes in the pp-wave background Therefore, there 
is a possibility that the  corrections could potentially 
contribute to the three-point interactions at tree level. In section 2 we 
compute the string tree level three-point amplitude for a graviton and two scalars,
i.e. we use the formalism of to compute a 
matrix element of the cubic interaction Hamiltonian for the states represented 
by the graviton and a combination of the dilaton and axion fields of the 
Type IIB supergravity on the pp-wave background. We discover that the off-shell
amplitude contains  corrections encoded in the Neumann
coefficients of the zero modes of the full string theory vertex. We show that
when we impose conservation of  and , this amplitude vanishes
on-shell. In section 3, we compute the graviton dilaton-axion cubic vertex
starting from the Type IIB supergravity action expanded around the pp-wave 
background in the light-cone gauge. We show that it vanishes on-shell and
thus verify in the  limit our string theory
computation.
Graviton axion-dilaton interaction from light cone string field theory 
Some Key Results of the Light-Cone String Field Theory in PP-Wave 
Following the light-cone string field theory formalism of 
developed in Minkowski space, Spradlin and Volovich successfully generalized
it to strings propagating in the plane wave background 
In particular, they constucted a cubic interaction Hamiltonian that can
be expressed as
H_3h_3V, 
where  is a three-string vertex satisfying the kinematic
constraints given by equations (4.2)-(4.5)
of    and the prefactor 
 must be inserted at the interaction point in order to 
preserve supersymmetry. More explicitly
Vwhere the bosonic and fermionic zero mode parts of the vertex are
E^0_a=exp [12 _r,s=1 ^3_I=1 ^8
a^I _rN^rs a^I _s], 
E^0_b=18! _a_1 ...a_8  ^a_1  ...
^a_8  ,where  ^a=_1^a+
_2^a+_3^a, 
's are zero modes of the fermionic conjugate 
momenta of the string. They are complex positive chirality 
 spinors with . The strings are labeled by 
.
We are only going to be concerned with the states corresponding to the
Type IIB supergravity multiplet . However, as was pointed out to us 
by M. Spradlin and was discussed in the 
supergravity modes do not decouple from the string modes in the 
pp-wave background. Decoupling only takes place in the flat space
limit when . We will therefore be 
using the Neumann coefficients for the zero modes of the full string 
theory vertex derived explicitly in  , instead of the 
supergravity vertex given in  . The zero mode Neumann coefficients are
&N^rs =(1+k)^rt ^su 
_t_u^2_3 ,r,s,t,u1,2,&N^3r =N^r3 =--_r_3  ,r
1,2,&N^33 =0,  
where  and  and where
by  we really mean . This point is important because in the 
pp-wave metric we have a non-zero  component and therefore
strictly speaking  and   are different.
From eq.(4.18) of   we have the following prefactor for the 
zero modes
h_3=P ^IP ^Jv_IJ (), 
where
v_IJ ()=^IJ +16^2 t^IJ _abcd 
^a^b^c^d+168!^4 ^IJ 
_abcdefgh ^a^b^c^d^e
^f^g^h, 
^a=_1_2^a-_2_1^a
=_3_1^a-_1_3^a=
_2_3^a-_3_2^a, 
P ^I=_1p_2^I-_2p_1^I=
_3p_1^I-_1p_3^I=_2p_3^I-_3p_2^I, 
and
p^I= (a^I+a^I ). 
The self-dual tensor  was defined in   in 
terms of  gamma matrices as 
t^IJ _abcd =^IK _[ab ^JK _cd]  
and satisfies various identities given in Appendix A of  .
Appendix C of this paper contains some extra identities for tensor
 that could be useful in future computations.
Using the constraint 
together with  it is easy to show that 
P ^IP ^JV-_1_2_3[1_1 p^I_1p^J_1+
1_2 p^I_2p^J_2+1_3 p^I_3p^J_3 
]V. 
Following  will assume that  and  are positive
with . 
We can further substitute  for  to obtain from 
the following
P ^IP ^JV-_1_2_3&[(a_1^I+a_1^I )
(a_1^J+a_1^J )+(a_2^I+a_2^I )
(a_2^J+a_2^J )&-(a_3^I+a_3^I )
(a_3^J+a_3^J )]V.  
For   can be written   as
P ^IP ^IV-_1_2_3[a_1^I a_1^I
+a_2^I a_2^I-a_3^I a_3^I]V. 
The light-cone Hamiltonian for bosonic zero modes is given by
H_r=_I=1 ^8a_r^I a_r^I+E^r_0, 
and the light-cone energy is
p^r_+ =_I=1 ^8n^r_I+E^r_0. 
Graviton Dilaton-Axion Vertex 
Here we will calculate a three string amplitude using the formalism
of   for a particular choice of states from the Type IIB 
supergravity multiplet. The superfield expansion for Type IIB supergravity 
in light-cone gauge
originally given by equation (1) of   is
(x,)&=_N=0 ^41(2N)! 
(^+ )^N-2 A_a_1 a_2 ...a_2N  ^a_1  
^a_2  ...^a_2N  &+_N=0 ^31(2N+1)! (^+ 
)^N-2 _a_1 a_2 ...a_2N+1  ^a_1  ^a_2  ...
^a_2N+1  .  
We are going to be interested in the bosonic terms corresponding
to  of the first sum that contain the dilaton, 
axion and graviton.
(x,)&=1(^+ )^2 
A^* (x)+1 4! A_abcd (x)^a^b^c^d&+1 8! (^+ )^2A(x)_abcdefgh 
^a^b^c^d^e^f^g^h+...,  
where we set .
The fields of interest are identified   as 
&(x)=(x)+i e^-(x) =A(x),&(x)=(x)-i e^-(x) =A^* (x),&h^IJ (x)=12 t^IJ _abcd A^abcd (x),  
where  is the RR scalar (axion),  is symmetric
and traceless (graviton), and  is the trace (dilaton).
As prescribed by   it is necessary to transform the superfield
 to the occupation number basis  for the transverse 
directions  and to momentum space 
for  coordinate
(x^+ ,,;k_I )&=4^2 
(x^+ ,;k_I )+1 4! A_abcd (x^+ ,;
k_I )^a^b^c^d&+^24 (x^+ ,;k_I )18! 
_abcdefgh ^a^b^c^d^e^f
^g^h+...,  
where we used  to replace  and  with  and .
The expression that we are about to evaluate has the form
(1)(2)(3)H_3, 
where we are only going to be interested in the terms proportional to 
 that contain the graviton coupled to the 
dilaton-axion pair. We will first deal with the fermionic zero modes and
use in our calculation the following conditions on  and
its conjugate momentum 
&^a0&0^a=0,&^a,^b=^ab .  
By counting the number of 's on the right hand side
to saturate the number of 's on the left hand side,
we see that only the second term in  will contribute to the
 interaction. Suppressing the  dependence, we
have the following expression for the graviton scalar vertex
A_h (1,2,3)&=k^1_I

where the occupation number states are defined as

Definitions  are based on the definitions of  and 
given in  . Following the standard procedure to bring all 
the 's to the left and all the 's to

We can now identify the graviton in  using  and use the explicit
representation for the occupation number states given by  to obtain from

A_h (1,2,3)&=13_1^2

An explicit derivation of the Type IIB supergravity spectrum in the pp-wave 
background was found in  . In particular, the  light-cone
gauge degrees of freedom of the graviton were classified according to their
 decomposition. Based on those results we can express 
various components of the graviton in terms of the mass eigenstates defined in 
  as follows
&h_ij =h^ _ij +18 _ij (h+h),&h_i^ j^  =h^ _i^ j^  -18 
_i^ j^  (h+h),&h_ij^  =h_j^ i =12 (h_ij^  +

where  and .
Expressed in terms of the mass eigenstates, the amplitude  becomes

For the last two lines in  we can combine  together with

Notice that the zero point energy contributions in  from

In our next step we will apply on-shell conditions together with conservation
laws and show that in that case the amplitude  will vanish.
Combining the conservation law  and

_I=1 ^8(n^3_I-n^1_I-n^2_I)=E^1_0+E^2_0-E^3_0.

Therefore, the on-shell graviton dilaton-axion quantum mechanical amplitude
in the pp-wave background vanishes at tree level. As a result of this 
analysis we have to modify conditions  and  by replacing
the  with  for the off-shell amplitude  to be non-zero.

Graviton axion-dilaton coupling in pp-wave background from 
Type IIB supergavity in light-cone gauge 
In this section we will calculate the graviton dilaton-axion cubic
interaction vertex in the pp-wave background starting from the Type IIB
supergravity action. We will see that much of the analysis of the
previous section will be carried over to this section.
The relevant piece of the Type IIB action is
S_IIB =-12^2   d^10 x -g g^ 
__ 2(Im  )^2  , 
where again
(x)=(x)+i e^-(x)  
is a combination of the dilaton and axion.
Expanding the dilaton-axion field around  as 

and expanding the metric around the pp-wave background as 
, we obtain from
 the following cubic vertex
S_h  =2 d^10 x -g 
g^  g^  h_  _
_, 
where we suppressed the prime. Following Metsaev and Tseytlin   we impose the 
light-cone gauge conditionsThis is slightly different 
from   since we are using a different metric convention.  
on 
h_- =0, h_-  =0, h_+ I =2 
_-  _J h_JI , h_++ =4 _-  
_I _J h_IJ , h_II =0, 
and substitute for the background metric
g^++ =1 4 ^2 x_I^2,  g^+- =
g^-+ =-1 2 ,  g^IJ =^IJ , 
where  and the determinant of the background metric . 
We then obtain from  the following expression for the cubic 
graviton dilaton-axion interaction in the light-cone gauge
S_lc & = 4 dx^+ dx^- d^8x [ (1(
_- )^2 _I _J h_IJ )_- _- - (1_-  _J h_JI )_- _I &- (1_-  _J h_JI )_I _- + h_IJ _I _J ].  
Notice that the result  is  independent and is exactly the same as 
in flat space (). The same feature was found in   where 
as a functional of classical fields, the three-scalar cubic interaction 
Hamiltonian in the light-cone gauge on the pp-wave was found to be identical to 
that in flat space. However, as the authors of   have pointed out, the 
quantum mechanical amplitudes on the pp-wave will have an explicit  dependence 
coming from the frequencies of harmonic oscillator modes. The Fock spaces for 
the flat and the pp-wave backgrounds are very different. In one case we have a 
collection of free particles, in the other case we have bound states confined by 
the gravitational potential well and described by the harmonic oscillator wave 
functions. Since the  and  are conserved in the pp-wave,
we will Fourier transform the fields in the light-cone directions  
and  as follows
h_IJ (x^- ,x^+ ;x)& = 1 2   dp_+ 
d   h_IJ (,p_+ ;x)
e^-i(x^- +p_+ x^+ ) ,(x^- ,x^+ ;x) &= 1 2   dp_+

d   (,p_+ ;x)

where , and  obtain from S_lc & = 23 12

&+ h_IJ (_1,p^1_+ ;x)(_I (_2,
p^2_+ ;x))_J (_3,p^3_+ ;x)]+c.c..  
After integrating by parts and using the conservation law 
 we finally get
S_lc & = 23 12

Just as we did in the previous section, we will use the
results of   to express various components of the graviton
in terms of the mass eigenstates . Then the action becomes

In further calculations we assume that state 3 is incoming and states 1 and 2 are 
outgoung. This is easily achieved by relabelling 
and .
The conservation laws will then read  and 
 where all 's and 's are now positive definite.
The dynamics of the fields in the transverse directions is governed by the light-cone 
Hamiltonian    given by
P _+ =-1  _I^2+^2  
4 x_I^2+(E_0 -4). 
This can be split into two contributions from the two  directions as
P _+ =P _+ ^ +P _+ ^ , 
where we have defined
&P _+ ^ =-1 _i^2
+^2 4 x_i^2+(E_02  -2),&P _+ ^ =-1 ^2_i^  +^2 4 
x_i^  ^2+(E_02  -2).   
Following the line of argument presented in   we notice that if we
use the conservation law , we can insert 
into the action terms proportional to
^24 (_1+_2-_3)(x^2_i-x^2_i^  ) 
without changing it. This allows us to combine  terms as

&-18_1  ((_i^2-_i^  ^2)

h_1 ((_i^2-_i^  ^2)

-(p^1 _+ +p^2 _+ -p^3 _+ ))
h_1 _2_3,  
where we also used the fact that the zero point energy contributions from the two
 directions cancel. Similarly, we can combine 
 terms to obtain the following expression for the action
S_lc & = 23 12  
dp^1_+ dp^2_+ dp^3_+

Corresponding to the Hamiltonian  are eight-dimensional 
harmonic oscillator wave functions 
 written explicitly in Appendix B. They form
a complete basis. It is natural to expand our interacting fields
in such a basis
&h^ _ij (,p_+ ;x)=_k 
h^ _ij (,p_+ ;k)_k ( 
2 x),&h^ _i^ j^  (,p_+ ;x)=_k 
h^ _i^ j^  (,p_+ ;k)_k 
( 2 x),&h _ij^  (,p_+ ;x)=_k 
h _ij^  (,p_+ ;k)_k 
( 2 x),&h (,p_+ ;x)=_k 
h (,p_+ ;k)_k 
( 2 x),& (,p_+ ;x)=_k 
 (,p_+ ;k)_k 
( 2 x),  
and similarly for ,  and .
The following analysis will be analogous to that of the previous section but 
now we will use the properties of the eight-dimensional harmonic oscillator
wave functions given in Appendix B in place of the Fock space amplitudes of
Appendix A. If we were now to calculate an off-shell interaction vertex
from  using expansions  we would have to use 
the most general case expression for (B.5)  given in   
and formulas (B.9)-(B.11). We state in Appendix A, that the general case formula 
for the string calculation (A.2) will reduce to (B.5) up to a normalization 
factor if we use the Neumann coefficients for the supergravity vertex given 
in  . Likewise, certain products of the string formulas (A.6)-(A.8) 
will reduce to the general case for (B.9)-(B.11). We can therefore conclude that 
up to a normalization factor, the off-shell interaction amplitude  
containing the  corrections will simply reduce for 
 to an expression that we could also have obtained 
from  which would have no string corrections. Although further 
analysis is almost identical to the one we carried out at the end the previous 
section, we will nevertheless include it for the purpose of completeness.
Once we insert the expansions  into the action , we will
apply conditions (B.6) and (B.12) in combination with  and 
to see which terms survive. For instance, let us consider the
first nine terms in  of the form  and 
 with various second derivatives. 
For all those terms  reads
_I=1 ^8(k^3_I-k^1_I-k^2_I)=4. 
After we substitute  into  all those terms will result 
in integrals of type (B.9)-(B.11) and will automatically vanish because 
 implies (B.12).
Performing a similar analysis for the other terms and dropping all those that vanish 
the action now reads
S_lc & = 23 12  
dp^1_+ dp^2_+ dp^3_+  
d_1 d_2 d_3 _1_2_3  
d^8x(p^1_+ +p^2_+ -p^3_+ )&(_1+_2-_3)(_1 _2 _3)&[1^2_1 
(-1_1 (_i_j^   
h _1ij^  )_2_3-1_2 
h _1ij^  (_i_j^  
_2)_3+1_3 h _1ij^  _2
_i_j^  _3)&+18 ^2_1  (E_123 ^ -E_123 ^ )
h_1 _2_3]+().  
Here we again used the notation of   to define
E^ _123 =p^1 _+ +p^2 _+ -p^3 _+ ,
E^ _123 =p^1 _+ +p^2 _+ -p^3 _+ . 
We see that all the remaining terms constitute special cases
described in Appendix B. Namely, for the three terms in  
containing second derivatives, condition  reads
_I=1 ^8(k^3_I-k^1_I-k^2_I)=2, 
while for the last terms with no derivatives it reads
_I=1 ^8(k^3_I-k^1_I-k^2_I)=0. 
We notice immediately that  implies (B.13) so we can use
(B.14)-(B.16) to evaluate the integrals (B.9)-(B.11) appearing
in the terms of  containing second derivatives. Since 
 implies (B.7) we can use (B.8) to evaluate the last terms.
The sum of the second derivative terms in  will then be 
proportional to
&(-1_1 I_1-1_2 I_2
+1_3 I_3)&=4_3  (-_1-_2+_3)
(k^1_i+k^2_i+1)^12 
(k^1_j^  +k^2_j^  +1)^
12 &F_k_1,k_2;k_1+k_2 (_1,_2;
_3),  
and will vanish due the conservation law .
The last term in  is proportional to
(E_123 ^ -E_123 ^ )=(_i=1 ^4(k^3_i-k^1_i-k^2_i)-
_i^ =5 ^8(k^3_i^  -k^1_i^  -
k^2_i^  )), 
where the zero point energy contributions cancelled each other
and since  for , the term
proportional to 
vanishes because individual terms inside the sums in  are zero.
Conclusion 
In this paper we explicitly calculated the graviton dilaton-axion three-point
vertex in the light-cone gauge in the pp-wave background. In section 2 we employed 
the light-cone string field theory formalism to obtain the off-shell vertex 
containing the stringy  corrections. Through a careful
analysis we showed that the vertex vanishes when all the particles are on-shell 
and the conservation laws are imposed. In section 3 we approached the same
problem from the low energy limit and expanded a particular sector of
the Type IIB supergravity action around the pp-wave background in the 
light-cone gauge. We then analysed the supergravity graviton dilaton-axion vertex 
using the properties of the eight-dimensional harmonic oscillator wave 
functions and showed that the interaction vertex vanishes
when the conservation laws are combined with the on-shell conditions.

The authors of   have investigated a possibility of
the S-matrix formulation for scalar field theories as well as a 
gauge theory coupled to scalars on the plane-wave background.
In section (3.2.1) of    it was shown that for gauge theory 
coupled to scalars, the corresponding interaction vertex for the on-shell 
"photon" exchange vanishes after some non-trivial cancellations. 
This result was used to argue that the propagator for the
exchanged particle in a four-point amplitude will never blow-up since
the exchanged particle will always be off-shell. This, together with the condition 
of convergence for the four-point amplitudes allowed them to conclude that 
the S-matrix interpretation for field theories on the plane wave background 
exists, at least at the tree level.

Our result is in the spirit of   and we can similarly 
conclude that in four-point amplitudes involving scalars coupled to gravity on 
the pp-wave background, the propagator of the exchanged particle will
never blow up and the potentially dangerous "graviton" will always be off-shell.
Moreover, our result is true not only in the case of a field theory such as
Type IIB supergravity (section 3), but also in the case of the 
full Type IIB string theory (section 2).
A Three-Particle Bosonic Amplitudes 
For our  computations we need to evaluate the expectation value given by
K_n^1_I,n^2_I;n^3_I (_1,_2;_3)=

Therefore  is 
non-zero only for .
If we use the Neumann coefficients for the supergravity vertex
given in  , expression  will reduce to formula (A.5) 
given in Appendix A of   up to a factor of

which was derived in  . Notice, that the Neumann coefficients
for the zero modes of the string vertex in  coincide with those of the 
supergravity vertex  and  given in  . Substituting
explicitly for  and  we obtain from K_n^1_I,n^2_I;n^1_I+n^2_I (_1,

(-_1_3 )^n^1_I2 
(-_2_3 )^n^2_I2 , 
which coincides with formula (A.6) given in Appendix A of   up to a 
factor of

Another expectation value that we would like to evaluate is
G^I _rn^1_I,n^2_I;n^3_I  (_1,_2;

(a^I_3)^n^3_I (a_r^I+a_r^I )E^0 _a0.

B  Integrals Involving Harmonic Oscillator Wave Functions 
Here we will list a few useful formulas and identities involving the 
eight-dimensional harmonic oscillator wave functions. This section will contain
expressions that can be easily derived based on the formulas given
in the Appendix A of   as well as in  .
The light-cone Hamiltonian for a physical field is
P _+ =-1  _I^2+^2  
4 x_I^2+(E_0 -4), 
where  is a contribution to the zero point energy coming from
the fermionic zero modes.
The corresponding wave function is 
_k ( 2 x)=
_I=1 ^8 _k_I ( 2 x_I), 
where
_k_I (2 x_I)=( 
2 )^14 12^k_I k_I!  
e^-x_I ^2/4 
H_k_I (2 x_I), 
with the energy
p_+ =(_I=1 ^8k_I +E_0). 
Following the notation of   we define
&F_k_1,k_2;k_3 (_1,
_2;_3)=_I=1 ^8F_k^1_I,k^2_I;k^3_I (_1,
_2;_3),&F_k^1_I,k^2_I;k^3_I (_1,_2;_3)&=_k^1_I (_12 
x_I)_k^2_I (_22 x_I)_k^3_I 
(_32 x_I)dx_I,  
where . The general expression for
  when
 was given in   
and it was found that it vanishes if . 
Therefore we have the following condition
F_k^1,k^2;k^3 (_1,_2;_3)
=0, 
if _I=1 ^8(k_I^3-k_I^1-k_I^2)>0. 
Of particular interest will be the case 
when . In this special case also given in  ,
_I=1 ^8(k_I^1+k_I^2-k_I^3)=0, 
F_k_1,k_2;k_1+k_2 (_1,
_2;_3)

(k^1_I+k^2_I)!k^1_I!k^2_I!  (_1_3
)^k^1_I2 (_2_3)^
k^2_I2 . 
Other cases of interest will involve integrals with second derivatives of the
wave functions. The cases relevant to our calculations will involve

I_1=_I=1 ^8(_J_K_k^1_I (_1
2 
x_I))_k^2_I (_22 x_I)_k^3_I 
(_32 x_I)dx_I, 

I_2=_I=1 ^8_k^1_I (_12 
x_I)(_J_K_k^2_I (_22 x_I)
)_k^3_I (_32 x_I)dx_I, 

I_3=_I=1 ^8_k^1_I (_12 
x_I)_k^2_I (_22 x_I)(_J_K
_k^3_I (_32 x_I))dx_I. 
Using formulas (A.5)-(A.7) of   it is straightforward to show that
I_1=I_2=I_3=0,if 
_I=1 ^8(k_I^3-k_I^1-k_I^2)>2. 
For purposes of the calculation it is important to note that  
is true for both  and . For a special case 
_I=1 ^8(k_I^3-k_I^1-k_I^2)=2, 
we have

I_1=_1^24_3 (k^1_J+k^2_J+1)^
12 (k^1_K+k^2_K+1
)^12 
F_k_1,k_2;k_1+k_2 (_1,_2;_3), 

I_2=_2^24_3 (k^1_J+k^2_J+1)^
12 (k^1_K+k^2_K+1
)^12 
F_k_1,k_2;k_1+k_2 (_1,_2;_3), 

I_3=_34 (k^1_J+k^2_J+1)^12 
(k^1_K+k^2_K+1)^12 
F_k_1,k_2;k_1+k_2 (_1,_2;_3), 
where  and the occupation numbers must satisfy the condition

k^3_I= 
k^1_I+k^2_I+1 & when  or  k^1_I+k^2_I & otherwise  . 
C Some  matrix identities 
This section contains some   matrix identities that we derived using
MathTensor and FeynCalc packages for Mathematica.
The gamma matrices satisfy 
^I_ac ^J_cb 
+^J_ac ^I_cb =2^IJ _ab , 
and
^IJ _ab =12 (^I_ac ^J_cb 
-^J_ac ^I_cb ). 
The self dual tensor  is defined as follows
t^IJ _abcd =^IK _[ab ^JK _cd] . 
Based on the definitions we have derived the following two 
identities 
t^IJ _abcd t^KL _abcd =
192^IL ^KJ -48^IJ ^KL +192^IK ^JL , 
and for a more complicated case we have
&t^MN _abcd ^I_ae 
^J_ef ^K_fg ^L_gh t^PQ _hbcd =&-96^ML ^PK ^NQ ^IJ +96^MK
