Segal proposed ultraquantum
commutation relations
with two ultraquantum constants
 
besides Planck's
quantum constant 
and with a variable .
The Heisenberg
quantum algebra is a contraction -
in a more general sense than that of Inonu and Wigner
-
of the Segal ultraquantum algebra.
The usual constant  arises as a vacuum order-parameter
in the quantum limit  .
One physical consequence is a discrete spectrum
for canonical variables and space-time coordinates.
Another
is an interconversion of time and energy
accompanying space-time meltdown (disorder),
with a fundamental conversion factor
of some kilograms of energy per second.  

Keywords: ultraquantum, group contraction, chronon,


Segal Doctrine 

A group that is  not semisimple we call compound ;
a theory based on a compound group  we also call compound.
Compound theories have idols
in the sense of Francis Bacon,
false absolutes,
which couple into other entities
with no reciprocal coupling.

A group is unstable if any neighborhood 
of its structure tensor 
- defining the product on its Lie algebra - contains
structure tensors
of a non-isomorphic group.
Then almost every group (structure tensor)
in the neighborhood 
is non-isomorphic to the unstable group.
Since measurements of structure tensors have error bars,
they assign probability 0 to
unstable groups.
Unstable groups in physics are not
based on experimental results as much as on
 faith in an idol.

Lie products  
- also called structure tensors - form a quadratic submanifold  
of the space of tensors .
By a contraction  of a Lie algebra we mean the endpoint

of a homotopy  in 
with ,  for , 
and .
The concept is Segal's,
the nomenclature ours.
Segal's concept includes
the Inonu-Wigner contraction
as a very special case.


Segal proposed that 
groups of a physical theory should be stable.
He further pointed out that stability requires
semisimplicity:
Compounds are unstable.
The Segal  Doctrine suggests that any
compound physical theory is a contraction
of a more stable, more accurate, semisimple theory,
which we call 
its expansion .


Examples 

The standard example
of group contraction and expansion is the 
Galileo group, in which 

B_x B_y = 0, R_z B_x = B_y, R_z B_y=-B_x,Here  is the boost along the  axis,   
is the rotation about the  axis, and 
is a Lie product.
The Galileo algebra is 
unstable, its idol the absolute time .
Its familiar expansion is the 
Lorentz group, in which now


B_x B_y = c^-2  R_z, R_z B_x = B_y, R_z B_y=-B_x,.
This expansion is now stable against itself: a further small change in 
makes no difference to the group.
The expansion parameter is
.

Every bundle in physics implies a  non-reciprocity,
an idol, an instability, and a compound group.
Indeed, the Galileo group is a bundle, 
the Lorentz is not.

For example, the point  is a simple object,
the chord  is a semisimple object,
the Cartesian product of two simples,
but the limiting chord,
the tangent vector , is a compound,
containing the simple  but not as a factor
in a Cartesian product.
The differential calculus is thus unstable,
and so may be an unsuitable language
for a supposedly empirical fundamental  physics.

In consequence the Heisenberg Lie algebra defined by
px =-i, i p =xi=0
is not simple or semisimple but compound and unstable. 
Its
idol is .
In the seminal paperthat stimulated the paper of Inonu and Wigner
,,
Segal proposed an  expansion
that simplified the Heisenberg algebra.
For homogeneity we introduce
skewsymmetric operators ,
  to go with 
and
designate their ultraquantum expansions by
.
The Segal ultraquantum commutation relations are essentially
p x =-i , 
i p  =-x , 
x  i =-p .
The compound Heisenberg algebra
has become the simple  algebra.
( is another possibility, 
more promising in several respects.)
This ultraquantum theory has two ultraquantum constants
 in addition to the quantum constant .
It also goes beyond the quantum theory in that it quantizes -
gives a discrete spectrum to -
the canonical variables themselves.
The space and time coordinates
obey essentially the same commutation relations
with the momentum and energy,
and therefore
undergo the same expansion
and quantization.


Quantum Principles  


By the relativity group of a system we mean the
group of all admissible frame transformations.
In classical mechanics this is the canonical group of the phase space.
In quantum theory it is 
the unitary group of the Hilbert space of the quantum
system. The Segal stability criterion suggests a fundamental
quantum principle:

The relativity group of the system is
a simple Lie group. 



We recover the part of quantum logic
expressed by  the ortholattice of  predicates or projection operators
as the lattice of simple Lie subgroups
of the relativity group of the system;
the orthogonality of two predicates is the commutativity
of two orthogonal subgroups, element by element.
It is well-known how to build the rest of the standard
quantum kinematics on this ortholattice foundation.
The ortholattice in question being non-distributive,
the simplicity principle
implies all the well-known quantum paradoxes.

Just as one may associate the unit energy intervals of the
harmonic oscillator with an elementary quantum
or phonon,
we  identify the unit intervals  of the discrete 
ultraquantum spectrum of time
with an elementary operation
which we call the chronon
,
characterized by a fundamental unit of time  (Chi).


Standard Model 


We apply the Segal criterion to the Standard Model.
The elements of the theory are
 
Complex numbers C 

Charges:  hypercharge, isospin, color 

Spin 

Space-time 

Fermions

Bosons 


We have italicized the unstable compounds.
The instabilities both arise from 
the Heisenberg commutation relations:
for  and  in the case of space-time,
for annihilators  and creators 
 in the case of Bose statistics.
The key idol is the  (or 1) on the right-hand side
of the canionical commutation relation.
The fermion algebra is a Clifford algebra,
which is stable.

The diffeomorphism group of general relativity
is likewise unstable
and has the same idol.
Thus present physics
is infested with a cluster of idols all of the same tribe.

The expansion parameters  
 stabilize all these compounds if we 
replace every occurrence of the unstable Heisenberg quantum
commutation relations by the stable
ultraquantum  commutation relations of Segal.
Stability thus leads us to
a real quantum theory rather than complex,
with a large
orthogonal group rather than a unitary one.
The representations of this
group may be found within its Clifford algebra.

Associativity is just as destabilizing
as commutativity.
It seems  likely that experiment 
will eventually
reveal non-associative processes
underlying the present associative ones.
Physically, non-associativity is a kind of binding.
A powerful language for non-associative combination
is set theory.
There binding is represented by the
Cantor brace , 
which maps any set to a unit set.
This defines
a non-associative product: 
. 
We do not pursue non-associative physics at present.
We introduce an 
ultraquantum set theory only
to expand the classical set theory 
incorporated in the present theory of space-time.

We form the mode vector space of ultraquantum set theory
by
expanding  
the mode vector space
of Fermi-Dirac statistics,
a Grassmann algebra.
The result is a free Clifford  algebra  over a 
quadratic space .
We write this as an exponential
V=2 ^V,
the quantum correspondent of the  classical power-set exponential
P X=2^X.
We designate the Clifford algebra over a 
quadratic space with dimension 
and signature  by .
Our  has  generators 
with  and  with .
In particular
.
 

In principle we need not give a separate meaning 
to the sub-symbol ,
since we use it only in the combination .
In fact  we think of  as a 
two-dimensional Clifford algebra, either the complex numbers

or the duplex numbers
, depending on the signature of .
 is a Clifford product of 's,
complex or duplex,
one for each dimension of ,
with all its 's anticommuting.
For even dim , we designate the underlying spinor module by
.
This power notation for Clifford algebras and spinors
incorporates several useful combinatorial identities. 

Ultraquantum Dirac Algebra 

We unify 
in one Clifford algebra  of dimension 
 the variables of
space-time-momentum-energy-spin
and the
 imaginary
unit ,
a six-fold unity,
putting off for the moment the unitary charges.
We index Clifford generators
, 
, .
The index  enumerates processes along
the world line, a proper time variable.
The usual Dirac spin 
is the "growing tip"  of the world line, ,

The ultraquantum variables
for one spin-1/2 particle are then
 



In the contraction to the quantum limit of the ultraquantum theory,
 
 

we impose .
Then 
Alg  contracts
to the Heisenberg algebra 
Alg
and
Alg 
contracts to  Dirac's extension of the Heisenberg algebra,
Alg.


Ultraquantum Dirac Equation 

A natural expansion of the Dirac equation,
with expanded symmetry group, is 
D &=&0D & :=& 2  ^2   S^ 
   L_  & & ^ _ +m_ 
as   N,  0, and    remains   finite  . 
Here,
S^ &:=&  2 
^ (N+1),L_ &:=&  2 
_n=1 ^N 
_ (n),
with  and
.

We guess that
 top-quark mass and
 age of universe:
* 

Cosmos Theory 

Quantum theory treats of sharp filtration processes.
No experimenter can carry out sharp filtration
processes on the entire cosmos.
How can one make a sensible cosmos theory?

Actually field theorists do this all the time.
Laplace already did it.
Their method was to ignore the
philosophical problem and invent
an imaginary exocosmic observer.
We do the same.

The Segal criterion helps here:
The purely operationalist theory
is naive, and makes the
absolute experimenter into a destabilizing
idol.

Thus the first step is to renounce operationalism.
Instead of the usual idealized version of the physical
experimenter

 on the system 
we introduce an imaginary
Cosmic Experimenter 

who  inputs, propagates, and 
outtakes 
the cosmos;
a quantum version of Laplace's fictitious 
omniscient intellect.
The CE does experiments 
described by unitary operators 
with matrix elements
of the form
where  is the duration of the experiment in
the proper time of the CE.
We imagine  measures
what
 measures;
and ignores
(traces over) what  ignores:
especially the proper time  of the CE.  
Then cosmic energy
 is a central ("superselection")
operator.

Q/Q Kinematics 

Field theory began with classical fields on classical space-time (C/C),
evolved to quantum fields on classical space-time (Q/C),
and we can now formulate a Q/Q theory (quantum fields on quantum space-time).

Question: How do we define a  field space
F=f^b
with quantum fiber and base defined by mode spaces  ? By correspondence we
demand that these spaces admit a concept of dimension with
.

Answer: Set .

Then 
F=f^b := ((2)^ )^b =(2)^b .
For this construction the field  must be spinorial, of course.  So it is.



Qubits to Qunats 

 We propose  to use the new algebraic
structure created by the  expansion
to make the observed bosons out of our fundamental
fermions. 
Fermion occupation numbers are quantum binary numbers
with eigenvalues 
: qubits .
A boson occupation number is a variable natural number 
with eigenvalues
:  a qunat .
We have to make qunats out of qubits.

It is easy to make "nats" (natural numbers)
out of bits;
evidently 1 nat =  bits.
Likewise 1 qunat =  qubits.
Here is one way of making a qunat  from  qubits
, 

in the limit :
 
Here 
are Segal ultraquantum constants and
the value of the qunat is
the usual oscillator Hamiltonian

with minimum eigenvalue  reset to 0
by subtraction.
For finite , however - and this is
supposedly the actuality -
these are not oscillators but rotators,
namely spins,
and the nat is bounded by .


Covariant Finite Toy Q/Q Kinematics 


The above  is a toy:
the least Clifford algebra expanding and stabilizing
the Poincare and Heisenberg Lie algebras.
It doesn't accommodate the standard model.
In quantum set theory,
after the Dirac algebra 
comes ,
a Clifford algebra 
over a 16-dimensional space instead of a 6-dimensional one.
The additional 10 dimensions might accommodate the GUT,
and 16 resonates with the Cartan-Atiyah-Singer-Botts
octal periods. 

Let us apply the Q/Q field construction () to the   toy:
 * 
The number of qubits per cell in this toy is 16.
The main thing is that the number is finite and the theory is covariant.
