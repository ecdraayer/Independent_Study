We solve for the expectation values of chiral operators in
supersymmetric  gauge theories with matter in the adjoint,
fundamental and anti-fundamental representations.  A simple
geometric picture emerges involving a description by a meromorphic
one-form on a Riemann surface.  The equations of motion are
equivalent to a condition on the integrality of periods of this
form.  The solution indicates that all semiclassical phases with
the same number of  factors are continuously connected.

Introduction 

In the previous century, it became clear that supersymmetric field
theories exhibit rich dynamics which is amenable to exact analysis
(for a review, see e.g. ).  A renaissance of this
subject has recently been stimulated by the work of Dijkgraaf and
Vafa , who, motivated by earlier developments
conjectured an interesting relation
between SUSY gauge theories and matrix models.  Many authors have
added to this framework matter in the fundamental representation
Here we will
continue the investigation in our previous papers
,, , in which these theories
have been studied by focusing on the chiral ring and the relations
which follow from the anomaly. As we will see, these relations can
be explicitly solved.

We will study a supersymmetric  gauge theory with chiral
superfields consisting of a multiplet  in the adjoint
representation, plus  copies of the fundamental
representation  (quarks, denoted , ) and  the
anti-fundamental representation (anti-quarks, denoted 
). We take the superpotential to be
 W_tree =W() + Q_f 
 m^f _f () Q^f, 
where we suppressed the color indices in the second term, and
 and  are polynomials.
Classically the theory has several vacua.  First, the fundamental
and anti-fundamental fields  and  can vanish while
 is a diagonal matrix whose eigenvalues are at the
stationary points of .  In these vacua, the quarks and
anti-quarks are massive, and the microscopic  gauge symmetry
is broken to  with . The second kind
of classical vacua involve nonzero expectation values of  and
. Here the gauge symmetry is broken to 
with .  In the quantum theory the unbroken 
 confines and the low energy spectrum includes a number of
 multiplets.

Our main tool in analyzing the dynamics is the chiral ring of the
theory.  Interesting bosonic operators in this ring are the gauge
invariant observables , 
 
 T(z)&= 1z-   R(z)&= -1 32 ^2  W_W^ z-  M(z)_f ^f &= Q_f   1 z- Q^f.  
Classically,  takes values in the complex plane, and these
observables have simple poles where  equals an eigenvalue of .
  In the quantum theory, some of the
poles become cuts and although an a priori  reason is not really
understood, it turns out that  can be analytically continued through
the cuts to a second sheet.  The two-sheeted plane is a Riemann
surface  which is described by the equation
 y^2=W'(z)^2 + f(z) 
where  of  is given by .  In
,  and  are polynomials of degree  and 
respectively, and  describes a genus  Riemann surface.

The exact solution corresponds to solving for the polynomial
, which depends only on the vacuum of the theory. However,
it is often useful to consider the "off-shell" theory for
arbitrary values of the  coefficients of this polynomial.
Alternatively, we can parametrize the solution by the  periods
 S_i =12i  _A_i  R(z) dz, 
where  are -cycles of .  Semiclassically, these
-cycles originate from the poles of the classical theory,
which quantum mechanically became cuts in the 
plane. Important objects in our discussion are the integers
 N_i =12i  _A_i  T(z)dz, 
which are the ranks of the various unbroken gauge groups.

In the following sections we describe the theory in more detail
and solve off-shell,   using
relations in the chiral ring, for  and , which were defined in
 .  One of the surprises  we
encounter is that  has a very simple analytic structure: its
only singularities are simple poles with integer residues. This is
particularly surprising for the poles in the second sheet which
are not even visible classically. We then view  as a
one-form on  and explore its periods.  Integrality of the
periods in  plus "modular invariance" (invariance under
exchanges of the periods that arise when parameters in the
superpotential are varied) suggests that all periods of 
might be integers. In particular, the other compact periods of 
 b_i =-12i  __i  T(z) dz, 
 which were introduced and interpreted physically in , are integers
on-shell.  The constraints on the analytic structure of
 and its periods allow us to find an explicit expression
for it.

We then compute the off-shell effective superpotential as a
function of  using the matrix model.  It is satisfying to
find out that the equations of motion of  which are derived
from this superpotential coincide with the previously imposed
geometric condition about the periods of .  This result is
consistent with the fact that  is satisfied only on-shell
and that imposing  allows us to completely solve for our
observables.

In , we explored the phases of the theory with 
only (and no quarks) as the parameters in the tree level
superpotential are varied.  Some of the phases of the theory were
distinguished by the behavior of Wilson and 't Hooft loops which
probe the different kinds of confinement.  Here, since the theory
includes fundamental matter fields, there is no real confinement,
and we might expect that there are no phase transitions
, .  We will use the term
"pseudo-confining" to describe a phase in which  and 
 have no classical expectation values and the individual low
energy  theories are confining, though the microscopic
 theory is not. The result of ,  is
the possibility of smooth interpolation between Higgs and
pseudo-confinement.

This subject has also been  discussed in  supersymmetric
theories with matter, first with  gauge theories
, and later with other gauge groups . It was shown
that the massless particles at special points in the moduli space
can be interpreted either as elementary quarks or as magnetic
monopoles. More explicitly, by varying the bare mass of the
quarks, one can continuously interpolate between a limit in which
it is more natural to interpret the massless particles as
electrically charged to a limit in which it is more natural to
interpret them as magnetic. When  is broken to  by a
mass term for the adjoint fields, these quarks/monopoles condense.
In one limit, where the condensed particles are electrically
charged, it is natural to interpret the condensation as a Higgs
mechanism. In the other limit, where the condensed objects are
interpreted as magnetic monopoles, the condensation looks in the
low energy pure  theory as confinement, but in the full
theory including the massive quarks, there is no precise order
parameter for confinement, and we will call this limit
pseudo-confining. Therefore, by changing the bare mass of the
quarks, one can continuously interpolate between Higgs and
pseudo-confinement.

The situation we have just described is a special case of a more
general story we will describe below.  We will show that as we
vary the parameters in , we can connect almost all the
classical limits of the theory with the same number of 
factors in the low energy spectrum.


The poles of  play a crucial role in the interpolation from
one classical limit to another.  A pole in the first sheet
represents a classical nonzero expectation value of , i.e., a
Higgs phenomenon.  A pole in the second sheet corresponds to an
expectation value of  that arises only from quantum
corrections.  In the quantum theory, the Riemann surface is smooth
and there is no physical boundary between the first and the second
sheet. The poles can continuously move from one sheet to another,
a phenomenon which represents the continuous interpolation between
the Higgs mechanism and pseudo-confinement.

By analogy with , we explore the various classical
limits of each branch by performing modular transformations on
.  Unlike the situation in , because of the
presence of the fundamental matter,  has poles and 
should be thought of as a Riemann surface with punctures. This
makes the relevant modular group bigger.  Using appropriate
modular transformations, we can connect all values of  with
fixed ; we can also connect most values of . Therefore,
the quantum theory has many fewer phases than the classical
theory.







Preliminaries 

We consider an  supersymmetric  gauge theory
with chiral superfields consisting of an adjoint multiplet
    ,  fundamentals , and
 anti-fundamentals  ( and 
are the flavor indices). As in the introduction,
the tree level superpotential is
 W_tree =W() + Q_f 
 m^f _f () Q^f. 
  The function  and the
matrix  are taken to be polynomials
 
 W(z)&=_k=0 ^n 1k+1  g_k z^k+1   m_f^f (z) &=_k=1 ^l+1   m_f, k ^ f z^k-1 .  

It is convenient to define the polynomial
 B(z)=m(z). 
We denote its degree by  and its roots by  ().
We will see from the solution of the theory that some of its
observables depend only on  and not on the details of the
matrix .  will play the role of an effective
number of flavors. We assume that  is sufficiently generic
so that
  does not have double roots, and none of its
roots coincide with those of .

Some special cases are the following:
 1.  No flavors.  This is the basic example which is most widely
studied.  When , this theory has 
 supersymmetry.
 2.  No  or equivalently  with large .
  This theory is  SQCD.
 3.  .
 Here the theory without  has  supersymmetry.
 4.   with
 .  This theory was studied in .


 Let us examine the vacua of the theory in the semiclassical
approximation.  We parametrize the superpotential of the adjoint
field as
 W'(z)= g_n_i=1 ^n (z-a_i) 
in terms of its stationary points .  A first set of vacua,
which we will refer to loosely as "pseudo-confining vacua,"
arise from
 Q=& Q  =0 =& 
 a_1&&&&&&&&& &.  &&&&&&&& &&.  &&&&&&& &&&a_2&&&&&& &&&&.  &&&&& &&&&&.  &&&& &&&&&&a_3&&& &&&&&&&.  && &&&&&&&&.  & &&&&&&&&&a_n   
where  occurs  times ().  Here, the
fundamental  gauge group is broken to .  At
low energies the  confine, leading to 
vacua in which the low energy gauge group is .   can be
less than  if some of the  do not appear in  and
the corresponding  are equal to zero.

There are also Higgs vacua in which  and  have a
vacuum expectation value at the classical level, and one of the
diagonal elements of  is equal to a  zero of
, say .
 In explaining how this works,
 in order not to clutter the equations, we consider the simple
case of . The choice
 
 Q= &h&0&&.&&.&&.&&0  Q= &h&0&&.&&.&&.&&0  =&
 z_1&&&&&&&&& &a_1  &&&&&&&& &&.  &&&&&&& &&&a_2&&&&&& &&&&.  &&&&& &&&&&.  &&&& &&&&&&a_3&&& &&&&&&&.  && &&&&&&&&.  & &&&&&&&&&a_n   
gives a classical vacuum when
 h h = - W'(z_1)B'(z_1) . 
In such a vacuum, the fundamental  gauge group is broken to
 with .

We cannot have two different eigenvalues of 
, say  and 
, equal to . In this case 
 and  must be
nonzero, but then the equation of motion of  is not
satisfied.

More generally, for each zero  of , we let  denote
the number  of eigenvalues of   that are equal to .
In a classical vacuum, each  can be either zero or one.
Clearly,
 0_I=1 ^L r_I  L, 
and
 
 N =_I=1 ^L r_I +_i=1 ^n N_i. 
We will refer to vacua with nonzero  as "Higgs vacua."
Again, at low energies  confine and lead to
 vacua with gauge group .  We will see below
that in the quantum theory the pseudo-confining vacua  are
continuously connected to the Higgs vacua .


We will be interested in the chiral operators
, 
 
 T(z)&= 1z-   w_(z)&= 1 4  W_z-   R(z)&= -1 32 ^2  W_W^ z-  M(z)_f ^f &= Q_f   1 z- Q^f  
These composite operators are defined initially in terms of a
power series in  around infinity, but turn out to have
an interesting analytic continuation. All these operators are
 for .

First, let us examine these observables in the classical theory.
For , we easily find
 T_cl (z)=_i N_i z-a_i  + _I r_I
 z-z_I . 
 
 We will view  as a one-form.  Classically, its only singularities
 are
simple poles at ,  and infinity with residues ,
 and , respectively.  Generalizing , we find
  M_cl (z) = - _I=1 ^L r_IW'(z_I)  z- z_I  
 _z_I  1 m(x)  dx, 
i.e. there are poles only at  with .  In contrast to
poles of , the poles of  have residues that depend on
the details of the interactions. The classical limit of  is
zero, since it is proportional to a fermion bilinear.

Now let us give a preview of what will occur in the quantum
theory.  Quantum mechanically, when the fermion bilinear in the
numerator of  gets an expectation value, one might expect
 to develop a singularity at  and/or (in a Higgs
vacuum)  because the denominator of  is singular when
 approaches an eigenvalue of .  We will see that actually
 has no singularities at , while the singularities of
  associated with  are replaced by cuts that shrink to
 in a weak coupling limit; we let  denote a cycle that
circles counterclockwise once around the  such cut.
Because of the cuts,  is naturally defined on a Riemann
surface  that is a double cover of the -plane.  Any
value of , such as , really corresponds to a pair of
points on ; we denote the points with  as ,
which is on the first sheet and visible semiclassically, and
, which is on the second sheet and invisible
semiclassically.

 and  are also naturally defined on this double cover, and
as functions on , their only singularities turn out to be
simple poles. The classical pole of  at  with residue
 is replaced by a quantum statement 
; in effect, these poles disappear when the points  are
replaced by cuts and the -plane by its double cover .
The other classical singularities of  are the poles at those
 with ; these are also the locations of the only
classical singularities of . What happens to these
singularities quantum mechanically? They remain as simple poles
and, roughly speaking, they do not move from their classical
locations at .  To be more precise, these poles appear
quantum mechanically at the points  that lie above  on
the first sheet of .  The residues of  at these
poles are equal to 1 quantum mechanically just as classically;
this actually follows by an argument similar to one in .
Indeed, letting  denote a small contour around , the
contour integral 12i _C_I T(z)dz=12i _C_I 1z- dz,  is really a -number, not subject to quantum
fluctuations, since it is equal to the number of eigenvalues of
 enclosed by the contour.  If the only singularity of 
enclosed by  is a simple pole, the residue must hence be one.

On the other hand, the residue of the pole of  does receive
quantum corrections; it is not protected by any such argument,
because of the quark operators in the numerator of . In
addition to the singularities at ,  and  will turn out
in general to have poles, crucial in the consistency of the whole
picture, at the points  on the second sheet. The
meaning of these poles is somewhat mysterious from a
semi-classical point of view, as the second sheet is invisible
classically.  Quantum mechanically, they reflect the fact that the
Higgs phases can be reached from the pseudo-confining phase by
analytic continuation.

Anomaly Equations 

To verify and extend these statements, we will use the relations
obeyed by the operators  in the chiral ring. These
operators satisfy the anomaly equations
, 
  
 &[W'(z)T(z)]_- + [m'(z)M(z) ]_- =
 2R(z)T(z) +w_(z) w^(z) &[W'(z) w_(z)]_-  = 2R(z)w_(z) &[W'(z) R(z)]_-  = R(z)^2 & [(M(z)m (z))_f^f'  ]_-= R(z)
 _f^f'    & [(m(z) M(z))_f ^f'  ]_-
 = R(z) _f ^f'     
Here  and  are matrices in flavor space.  We multiply
such matrices as  and 
denotes a trace over the flavor indices.  Below we will solve
these equations.

We start by solving the third equation in .  We write it as
 W'(z) R(z) +1 4  f(z)  = R(z)^2 
with a polynomial  of degree
.  Its solution is
 2R(z)= W'(z) -W'(z)^2 +f(z) . 
This solution is parameterized by the  coefficients in .
We see that  has cuts in the complex  plane.  In the
semiclassical approximation of small , each cut  is
naturally associated with a zero of , .

It is natural to analytically continue  through the cuts to a
second sheet.  The double-sheeted complex plane is a Riemann
surface .  Define
 y(z)=W'(z) - 2R(z) 
and write  as an equation for a Riemann surface 
 y^2=W'(z)^2 + f(z). 
This genus  Riemann surface was introduced in . We
can
 naturally understand  as a double cover of the complex
 -plane branched at the
roots of . There are  branch cuts; as above we
denote as  a contour that circles around the  cut.
Most of the functions we will consider in this work have
singularities at infinity; if the points on  with 
are removed, the  cycles  with  are
independent.  Instead of parameterizing  by the coefficients
in , we alternatively parameterize it by the variables

 S_i = _A_i R(z)dz  i= 1,..., n. 



Each point on the complex -plane labeled by a given value of
 corresponds to a pair of points on . To specify a point
 on , we must give its  coordinate  and also
its  coordinate .  For each point  on the first
sheet, there is an image point  on the second sheet,
with  and .  Actually,
the terminology "first sheet" and "second sheet" is useful
primarily in a semiclassical limit in which   is large; more
generally we would simply refer to a pair of points  and
 with the same value of . Clearly, we have also
 
 &W'()=W'()   &R() + R() = W'(z).  
We will sometimes adopt a convenient though slightly imprecise
notation, writing  when we mean  and , or
 when we mean  and .


The branch of the square root in  is chosen such that for
large  in the first sheet we recover the semiclassical answer
 R(z) - f(z) 4 W'(z) =S z  +
 (1/z^2) . 
(A simple contour deformation argument shows that .)
Then, using  it is easy to see that the asymptotic limit in
the second sheet is
 R( z) = W'(z)+ (1/ z)=
 g_n z^n + ( z^n-1 ). 


Solving For  And  

In this section, we consider  of  as given and solve
for .  This means that we solve for  as a function of
. Moreover, in this section, we will find a solution which
corresponds in the semiclassical limit to the pseudo-confining
vacua ; in other words, we set all . For such
solutions, we impose that  and therefore also  are
regular in the first sheet except for the cuts. As we will see,
other solutions correspond to the Higgs vacua . We will
discuss below the question of whether these branches are connected
to the pseudo-confining vacua.

Solving For  

 is solved from the last two equations in  
 &[(M(z)m(z))_f^ f'  ]_-= R(z)
 _f^ f'  &[(m(z)M(z))_f ^f ]_- =
 R(z) _f ^f'  .   
We determine the polynomials  and  such that
 is regular in the first sheet .

We claim that the solution with these boundary conditions is
 M(z) = -_i=1 ^n _A_i  R(x) x-z   1
 m(x)  dx 
where  are the cuts in .  To prove it, we note that the
integrand in  decays as  at infinity in the
first sheet (with the branch of the square root given in )
and therefore by contour deformation,  is equivalent to
 M(z)=-_i=1 ^n _A_i  R(x) x-z  1  m(x)  dx=R(z) 1 m(z)  - _I=1 ^L R(_I) z-z_I 
 _z_I  1 m(x)  dx. 
To obtain this formula, we have used contour deformation on the
first sheet; the term  comes from the pole of the
function , and the second term comes from the poles of
matrix elements of .  These latter poles are at ,
the points at which .  Each point  corresponds
to a pair of points  on , where 
is on the first sheet and  on the second; since the
contour deformation in  has been done on the first sheet,
the residue at  involves , the value of  on the
first sheet. To verify that  satisfies , we
proceed as follows. Multiplying the right hand side of 
 by  from the right or the left, the first term contributes
 times a unit matrix.  And the second term leads to a
polynomial in  because
 
 m(z)z-z _I  _z_I  1 m(x)  dx=&m(z)-m(z_I)
 z-z_I  _z_I  1 m(x)  dx+  m(z_I)
 z-z_I  _z_I  1 m(x)  dx   =&m(z)-m(z_I) z-z_I   _z_I  1 m(x)  dx+  1
 z-z _I  _z_I  m(x)1 m(x)  dx  =&m(z)-m(z_I) z-z_I   _z_I  1 m(x)  dx  
is a polynomial in .  This verifies that our formula for  does
obey .

Because of the polynomial ambiguity in , its solution is
not unique. The particular solution  of  was chosen to be
regular at the points , which lie at large values
  that (if we are near
a semiclassical limit) are outside the integration contours in
. Regularity at  is, as we have seen, the right
behavior for the pseudo-confining solutions with .
However, the solution  actually has a pole at the points
 on the second sheet.  This behavior is evident in
: as , the singularities of
the two terms on the right hand side of  do not cancel at
, though they cancel at .  At first sight, the
meaning of the singularity of  on the second sheet is rather
mysterious, since the second sheet is invisible classically.
  Its interpretation will ultimately
become clear.

Solving For  

Having found  and , we can solve for . We solve
for  as a function of . The polynomial ambiguity in the
equations is determined by imposing that 
.  Since we use the solution for  given by  or
equivalently by , the result obtained here is relevant to
the pseudo-confining vacua with .

First we need to calculate  with
 given in .  We get
 
 &[ m'(z)M(z)]_-=[R(z) m'(z)1  m(z) ]_-  - _I=1 ^L [R(_I) z-z_I 
 _z_I  m'(z) 1 m(x)  dx]_- &=
 R(z) B'(z)B(z)  - _I=1 ^L R(_I)z-z_I 
 - _I=1 ^L [R(_I) m'(z)-m'(z_I) z-z_I 
 _z_I 1 m(x)  dx]_- &= B'(z)( W'(z)- y(z))2B(z)  -_I=1 ^L
 W'(z_I)-y(_I)2(z-z_I) 
   .  
We used the relation
 and the
fact that the first two terms in the second line have only
negative powers of  and the third term is polynomial in .


Since  and  are polynomials and the zeros of  are ,
 B'(z)W'(z)2B(z)  -_I=1 ^L
 W'(z_I)2(z-z_I)  =[B'(z)W'(z)2B(z) ]_+
 =[B'(z)y(z)2B(z) ]_+ , 
where the last step
is correct only in the first sheet (on which  vanishes
for large ).  Therefore
 becomes
 [ m'(z)M(z)]_-=-[ B'(z)y(z) 2B(z) ]_- +_I=1 ^L y(_I)2(z-z_I) . 

Supersymmetric vacua are described by solutions of  with
. So the first equation in  reduces
 [W'(z) T(z)]_- -2R(z)T(z)+
 [m'(z)M(z)]_-=0, 
 and
can be written as
 [y(z) T(z)]_- =- [m'(z)M(z)]_-
 =[ B'(z)y(z) 2B(z) ]_- -_I=1 ^L y(_I)2(z-z_I) . 
 Hence
  T(z)= B'(z) 2B(z) -_I=1 ^L y(_I)2y(z) (z-z_I) + c(z) y(z)  
where
 c(z)= W'(z)-W'()  z- - 12   _I=1 ^L W'(z)-W'(z_I)
 z-z_I  
is a polynomial of degree .

For large , the first term in  behaves as 
since . The second term behaves as
. This is enough to determine the large
  behavior of ,

 T(z)=
 Nz  + (1z^2 )& in the first sheet L-Nz  + (1z^2 )&
 in the second sheet .   

For the pseudo-confining vacua, we expect  to be regular at
the points  on the first sheet. This indeed follows from
, as  for .  On the second
sheet, since  for , 
has a pole,  for .  Why the residue
of this pole is precisely 1 will be clear when we compare to the
Higgs vacua.

Finally,  can be determined by the requirements
 _A_i  T(z) dz=N_i . 

Let  denote the point  on the first sheet and 
 the point  on the second sheet. We can summarize the
singularities of  as follows:  has simple poles at ,
, and  with residues ,  and 
respectively.  Elsewhere it is regular.


Higgs Vacua And Singularities In The First Sheet 

Consider varying the parameters in  with fixed
 and fixed . The Riemann surface  is
unchanged but the zeros  of  change. Let us move one
of them, say , through one of the cuts, say .  Of the
two points  and  on  that correspond to
, our solutions for  and  have poles at 
, which is on the second sheet, but not at .  When
 passes through the cut, the two points  and 
 are exchanged. We end up with solutions for
  and  which obey the equations but do
not satisfy the boundary conditions that we have imposed so far;
they are singular at .

This process has a simple physical interpretation.  We started
semiclassically with  whose eigenvalues, as shown
in , are approximately equal to the roots  of ; this
corresponds to having
all .  In a semiclassical limit, the
 cut  is near .  When  passes through the cut,
it is near  and the solution  is near the solution
 that describes the Higgs branch.  At this stage, the
strong quantum dynamics are important and a semiclassical
treatment is not precise enough. Passing  through the cut and
taking it to be again large (or at least far away from all cuts),
we may find ourselves in a  Higgs branch with .  On this
branch,  and  are expected to have poles on the first sheet.
Thus, our proposal is that in a process in which  moves
through one of the cuts, a branch with  is continuously
transformed into a branch with .


Let us see how this occurs in terms of our solution. The analytic
continuation of  is completely clear: when  moves
through the cuts,  and  are exchanged.  Thus,
 transforms into
 M(z)=R(z) 1 m(z)  - R(_1)z-z_1 _z_1 1m(x)  dx -_I=2 ^L R(_I) z-z_I 
 _z_I  1 m(x)  dx.  
To derive this from , we note that as  moves, the cut
 must be continuously deformed to avoid  and 
.  By the time  and  have been exchanged,
 has transformed to a contour ,
where  and  are small contours that,
respectively, encircle  and  in the
counterclockwise directions.   is thus replaced by
M(z)=-_i=1 ^n_A_i R(x)x-z 
1m(x) dx +_C_1 R(x)x-z  1m(x) dx
+_C_1 R(x)x-z  1m(x) dx.  The extra
two terms in  have the effect of cancelling the
singularity at  and adding a singularity at .


 Original configuration with  on the
upper sheet (black dot) enclosed by the  contour and 
 on the lower sheet (white dot) enclosed by the 
contour. Also shown is the first cut (wide black line) enclosed by
the  contour.  Same configuration as in  after
 and  are passed through the first cut. The
 contour is deformed as shown. A new  cycle that only
encloses the cut is then given by  
trans.eps  


Similarly, the singularity of  in the second sheet at
 moves to the first sheet to . Thus, after
 passes through the  cut, we have 
, .  In the course of the
transition, the integers  cannot change.
After the transition,  has transformed to
, so after the transition
 and hence
. Thus, the effective value of 
has been reduced by 1 in this transition.


More generally, for arbitrary , the solution for 
becomes
 
 M(z) = &R(z) 1m(z)  - _I=1 ^L (1-r_I)R(_I) z- z_I   _z_I  1 m(x)  dx -_I=1 ^L r_IR(
 _I)z- z_I   _z_I  1 m(x)  dx =&R(z) 1m(z)  - _I=1 ^L r_IW'(z_I) +(1-2r_I)
 R(_I) z- z_I   _z_I  1 m(x)  dx  
where we used  to express .
We would like to make a few comments about this expression:
 1.   has a singularity with residue 
 at  and a
singularity with residue 
 at .  In particular,
singularities are at  if  and at  if
. 2.  In the classical limit of zero , this
expression coincides with our classical answer .  Note that
the residue of  at  is 
, which is corrected from the classical
answer .
 3.  It is easy to check, as in , that the terms
 which are summed over  in  have the property that when
 they are multiplied by  they lead to a polynomial in .
 These terms change the poles in  and modify
 the polynomials  and , but
 do not affect the anomaly equations .

By repeating the procedure that was used to find , or by simply
analytically continuing  to let the  pass through the
cuts,  we find that the general solution for  is
  T(z)= B'(z) 2B(z) -_I=1 ^L (1-2r_I) y(_I)2y(z) (z-z_I) +
 c(z) y(z) . 
We have used the fact that when  passes through a cut and
 becomes 1,  is transformed to
 As expected, for  the function
is regular at  and has a pole with residue one at 
, while for  it is regular at  and has a
pole with residue one at . The number of singularities in
the first sheet is  and satisfies 
 in agreement with the classical reasoning in .

By interpreting the analytic continuation of the pseudo-confining
vacua as  pass through cuts as physical Higgs vacua, we can
shed light on many otherwise mysterious features of the solutions
found in section 3 for the pseudo-confining vacua.  For example,
the singularities on the second sheet now have a rationale; upon
analytic continuation, they become semiclassical singularities on
the first sheet in Higgs vacua.  It is also now clear why the
residues of poles of  on the second sheet are precisely
1: this is needed to agree with the semiclassical behavior in
Higgs vacua.

All of our analysis has been carried out at fixed .  This
corresponds to treating the field theory off-shell; an on-shell
analysis, by contrast, would involve extremizing the
superpotential as a function of the .  In effect, in our
analysis, we have ignored the fact that the  will change when
the  are varied.  In this off-shell analysis, we have found
that  can be reduced, for any given , by passing the 
through the  cut .  Clearly, there must be a limit to
this process, for if it is performed too many times,  will
become negative.  Intuitively, we expect that if the  are
large enough then the back-reaction on the  in moving a
single  through a cut is small.  How far can one expect to go
before the back-reaction becomes significant?  We conjecture but
will not try to prove in this paper that a given  can be
reduced all the way to  by passing  of the  through
the cut .  One cannot expect to go farther, since if 
changes from 1 to 0, this would change the number of 's in
the low energy gauge group, so such a process cannot occur
continuously. It must be that if one tries to transform  all
the way to zero, the cut  will close up at the last step. We
return briefly to this issue in section 8.

  As A Differential And The Complete Solution 

By definition,  is a meromorphic differential on the
Riemann surface  of genus  that was given in  :

 y^2=W'(z)^2+f(z). 

 has simple poles at ,  and 
with residues ,  and  respectively.  We are now going
to introduce some formalism for describing  in more detail.
This will eventually be used in section 7 to prove that on-shell,
the periods of  are all integers.  At the end of the present
section, we will assume this statement and deduce some
consequences.

Ignoring the punctures of  at  and , a complete
basis of independent -cycles of 
are the   for . If  and  are any chosed points
in , then the Riemann-Roch or index theorem can be used to show that
meromorphic differentials on  with poles at  and  and no
other singularities do exist.  By normalizing such a differential, we can
make the residues at  and  precisely  and ; by adding
a holomorphic differential, we can in a unique fashion
make the  periods vanish.
Hence, there exists
a unique meromorphic differential  whose only
singularities on  are simple poles at  and  with
residues  and  respectively and 
.

Since  is singular only at ,  and 
, the differential

T(z)dz -( N _P,P  + _I=1 ^L 
_P, _I  )    

is a holomorphic one-form on . Using a basis for holomorphic
differentials  on  which is
characterized by , we have

T(z)dz = N _P,P  + _I=1 ^L  _P
, _I  + _j=1 ^n-1 h_j _j . 

The constants  are determined from  for 
 as . The condition on  is automatically
satisfied. To see this note that on the first sheet the integral
around  can be deformed to an integral around  and
. This leads to 
. We conclude that

T(z)dz =  N _P,P  + _I=1 ^L  _P, _I  + 2i_j=1 ^n-1 N_j _j .  


We now consider the noncompact cycles 
with the intersection pairing , 
 (see figure 2).  It is convenient to use the basis
 defined by 
. Clearly,  are compact cycles and together with 
for  form a canonical basis of .

Consider first the period

 __k T(z)dz =N__k  _P,P 
+_I=1 ^L __k _P, _I + 2i_j=1 ^n-1 N_j__k  _j.   

Using the Riemann bilinear relations, we have that for any
 (see appendix B for a review),

__k _p_1,p_2  = _p_2 ^p_1 _k 

where the contour in the right hand side is as follows. If 
and  are on the same sheet, the contour is on that sheet. If
 and  are on different sheets the contour crosses
through cut number . In both cases winding around the 
cycles can lead to an integer ambiguity. This ambiguity
corresponds to the fact that in order to define the differentials
 and to derive the Riemann bilinear relations a
particular choice of representative of one cycles has been made. A
different choice leads to an answer which differs by an integer.
See appendix A for a more detailed discussion of this issue.

Using  in the first and second terms of  and the
fact that  in the last term
of  we get,

  __k T(z)dz =N_P ^P _k +
_I=1 ^L _ _I ^P _k +
_j=1 ^n-1 N_j__j  _k.  

Since the first and the last term of  can be combined

N_P ^P _k+_j=1 ^n-1 N_j__j  _k
=N__n _k+_j=1 ^n-1 N_j__j  _k
=_j=1 ^n N_j__j  _k, 

 can be written as

  __k T(z)dz = _j=1 ^n N_j__j 
_k + _I=1 ^L _ _I ^P _k. 

Finally, we can compute the period of  on the non-compact
cycle . This period is infinite and requires a
regularization. We will introduce regularized contours , as
contours from  to  passing through the
 cut.  is a complex number with sufficiently
large .  and  are the
points in the first and the second sheet which correspond to the
same value of .  Only the behavior up to
 will be relevant for us in the computations.


Using , we have

 __n T(z)dz = __n ( N_P,P  + _I=1 ^L_P , _I   + 2i_i=1 ^n-1 N_i_i).  

We want to write it as an integral of  over
various cycles.  In the last term we use


. In the second term we use the Riemann bilinear
relations
 _S^R_TQ = _Q^T_RS  
(recall that here and in the following expressions with line
integrals there is an ambiguity in  times an integer which
is discussed in appendix A) to write
 ^_0 __0  _P 
 , _I =_ _I ^P __0,
 _0 =_ _I ^P _P,
 _0  + (1/_0). 
Finally, we  note that
 _ _I ^P _P,
 _0 =_ _I ^_0 _P,
 P  + i  +(1/ _0). 
See appendix A for a proof of this result.

Combining these results,  can be written as,

 __n T(z)dz = N __0 ^_0 _P,P  + i L
+_i=1 ^n-1 N_i __i _P,P + _I=1 ^L
_ _I ^_0 _P,P 
+(1/_0) .  

where we have used that 
.

This can be brought to the same form as  by using that
,

 __n T(z)dz
=_j=1 ^n N_j__j _P,P  +
_I=1 ^L _ _I ^_0 _P,P  + i L +(1/_0) .  


Equations  and  for the periods of  will be
shown to be related to the field equations coming from the field
theory effective superpotential in  section 7. The field
equations imply that  are integers. Here we
will assume this fact and show that it is enough to determine all
the remaining parameters.

Assuming that  is an integer for all
 and recalling , it follows that   has
integer periods over all compact cycles of . Therefore
 has to be a logarithmic derivative of a meromorphic
function on :  for some .
 should have a pole at  of order  and zeros at 
 and  of order  and  respectively. For 
 such a function can be constructed as follows 
 (z)= P(z) +  P^2(z) - B(z) , 

where the degree  polynomial  and the constant 
must be determined.

The condition that  be single valued on  is

  
 &P^2(z) - B(z)=F(z) H^2(z)   &W'(z)^2+f(z) = F(z)Q^2(z),  

where ,  and  are polynomials in .  Indeed,
these conditions imply that .

The degree of  corresponds to the number of 's that are
taken to be zero. When a given  is zero, the corresponding
branch cut in  closes up.

Special cases are the following. 1.  deg: This
corresponds to the case with all  and the deg
. 2.  deg: This corresponds to the case when
the group is completely broken  to  and deg.

Using that

 T(z)dz = _z dz; (z)
=e^(z)   .  

we can explicitly compute the period of  on ,

  __n T(z)dz = ( 4B_L 
_0^2N-L  ) + O ( 1_0 ) 

where  is defined such that . This
result is consistent with the asymptotic behavior of  given
in .

In order to determine , note that  has mass dimension
, so  must have dimension . The only
parameter with mass dimension that does not depend on the details
of the superpotential is the scale  of the theory. So
 is equal to  up to a numerical
constant. This constant depends on the subtraction scheme. We
choose a scheme where the standard  result for the curve
 is recovered when 
. Note that here  is not the canonically
normalized mass. This choice leads to 
. It is convenient to define 
 such that the final result for  is
given by,

 1z- =
z  ( P(z) + P^2(z) -
4^2N-N_f  B (z)  ). 


Through equation  we can now determine also  and
therefore  and .  This means that all the observables
of the theory are now determined.  Of course, we still need to
justify the claim that the compact periods of  are all
integers.  We postpone this to section 7.

Matrix Model Computations 

In this section, we will explicitly compute the effective
superpotential from the matrix model.

Following , only the sphere and disk contribution to the
free energy of the corresponding matrix model are relevant. Let us
denote them  and  respectively. Explicitly, we have
to compute

  (  -N ^2S^2 _0 - N
S _1 + )  = 1vol  U(N)
  d ^N ^2   d Q  d
Q   ^N N_f  (  -N S [ W() + Q   m(  
) Q ] ) 

where  is a dimension one constant which will later be
identified with the dynamically generated scale of the field
theory.  is defined such that if all quarks are taken to have
masses equal to , i.e. 
, then the matrix integral over them
is equal to one; i.e.

  =dx d x  e^-N  xx  / S  = SN   = ( -N S ) 

where  and  are two integration variables We
can also redefine  and  such that
   ( -N ^2S^2 _0 - N S _1 +) = 1vol  U(N)
 d ^N ^2   d Q  d
Q   ^N N_f  ( -N S W() - Q   m(   )
Q  ). 

and . .

For large  the volume of  is
, ,

 vol  U(N) = ( - N ^22  [ N2  - 32 ]+ (1)
). 

Therefore,

 1^N ^2  vol  U(N)   =
( -N ^2S^2  [ S^2 (2^2 N +32 )] + (
1)).  

At weak coupling the potential in  has several minima.  We
will focus on an expansion around minima where  of the
eigenvalues of  are at  and 
. There are also minima with  eigenvalues of 
 at  and nonzero , .

The integral over  and  can be explicitly
carried out for diagonal  with eigenvalues ,

 d Q  d Q   ( -N S  Q   m(   ) Q  )  =
( -NS  [ N_f SNS  +
SN _k=1 ^N B(_k ) ]
). 

Recall that  has been defined in  to be equal to the
determinant of .

Reducing the integration over  to its eigenvalues
produces the Vandermonde determinant. This implies that the only
integration left in  can be written as

 _N   _k=1 ^N d_k ( -NS _k=1 ^N W(_k ) + 2 _i<j (_i - _j) -
_k=1 ^N B(_k ) ) . 

This integral can be evaluated using a saddle point approximation
and taking into account the measure factors gives

 ( - N ^2S^2 [ d()W() -dd()()   ] - NS [d()B()^N_f   ])
 

where  is the eigenvalue distribution normalized
to . This density function gives
 eigenvalues in the  cut.

 From ,  and  can be identified. For 
we have

 _0 = d()W()
-dd()() .  

As a check of the choice of measure (similar to computations by
Dijkgraaf and Vafa), we can take a superpotential of degree two,
i.e.  and 
. Explicit computation of the matrix
integral  and  can be done. Both computations give the
same answer,

 _0 = 12 S^2 m^2S 
+34 S^2. 


For  we have,

 _1 = d()B()^N_f  . 


Let us explicitly compute the disk amplitude in terms of the
resolventOur definition of the resolvent differs by a sign
from the standard matrix model convention (see for example
 ) which is given by 
.   . The integral in  can be written as
a contour integral by recalling that 
,

d()B() =
_i=1 ^n _A_i  dz R(z)B(z). 

In the logarithm we take the principal branch 
 with . Since 
 it has branch cuts which we take to run
between  and infinity ( in the upper sheet and 
in the lower sheet). We make sure that they do not intersect the
cuts of , such that  has no ambiguity.

The integral  can be written as

_i=1 ^n _A_i dz R(z)B(z) = S B_L
+ _I=1 ^L_i=1 ^n _A_i dz R(z)(z-z_I). 

Now we deform the contour integral.  We can do it either in the
upper or the lower sheet.  The simplest possibility is with 
in the upper sheet because at infinity .
The contour integral is given by a sum of two terms. The first is
an integral around infinity: a circle of radius .
This gives

S L2i  __0 ^e^2i 
_0  z z  dz = S L (- _0). 

The second contribution is a sum of contour integrals around the
cuts of  which run from  to :

_I _C_I  dz R(z) (z-z_I) = - _I
__I ^_0  R(z) dz. 

The logarithmic divergences of the two contributions  and
 cancel.  This is not surprising, because the original
contour integral  around the cuts of  is finite.

We conclude that the disk amplitude is

 _1 = S ((-_0)^LB_L^N_f  ) - _I __I ^_0  R(z) dz. 

We can also use  to express the integral
as an integral of , and then we can write it as an integral in
the second sheet
  _1 = - _I
__I ^_0 y dz +  S
((-_0)^LB_L^N_f  ) -L
W(_0) +_I W(z_I) . 

Matrix Model Determination Of  

Before concluding this section, let us present a matrix model
determination of . Recall the identification made in
,

M (z) = M(z) , 

where  is the field theory expectation value
of the operator defined in  and 
 is the average of the matrix function 
. In order to compute the latter, we
can first perform the gaussian integration over the matter fields
 and  in  for a given eigenvalue of
. This leads to the insertion of 
 in . In the saddle point
approximation, we get  by integrating
the single eigenvalue result over the eigenvalue distribution,
i.e.,

M (z) = d()- z 1m() .  


Using that 
  can be written as,

M (z) = -
_i=1 ^n_A_i  R(x)x-z 1m(x) dx 

which agrees with .

The Off-Shell Effective Superpotential 

The field theory effective superpotential receives contributions
from the sphere, , as well as from the disk, ,
amplitudes in the matrix model .

The sphere contribution up to terms with two derivatives of 
is

W_eff _sphere  = _i=1 ^n N_i _0S_i + 2i_i=1 ^n-1  b_i S_i. 

Note that no explicit  appears in , where
 is the bare coupling of the field theory. This is
due to the way the matrix integral  is normalized. In this
normalization,  is a finite quantity.

A detailed computation of  can be
found in appendix B. The result is given by

_0S_i = -__i y(z)dz +
W(_0) - 2S (-_0  ) +
O (1/_0).  

Therefore  is, up to  terms,

 W_eff _sphere   = -_i=1 ^n
N_i__i y(z)dz + N W(_0) - 2N S
(-_0  )+ 2i_i=1 ^n-1  b_i S_i.  

On the other hand, the disk contribution is

 W_eff _disk  = _1. 

Combining  with , we find that the effective
superpotential of the theory is (up to terms with two derivatives
of  and irrelevant  terms)

  
 W_eff  = & -_i=1 ^n N_i __i  y(z)dz -
 _I=1 ^L __I ^_0 
 y(z)dz  & + (2N-L)W(_0)+_I=1 ^L W(z_I)
  - i (2N-L)S + 2i _0 S  + 2i_i=1 ^n-1 b_i S_i ,  

where
 2i _0 = (B_L^2N-N_f   _0^2N-L  ). 
This can be more conveniently written in terms of 
 as follows:

 W_eff  = & _i=1 ^n N_i
__i R(z)dz + _I=1 ^L __I ^_0  R(z)dz & +
(N-L)W(_0)+_I=1 ^L W(z_I) -i (2N-L)S + 2i
_0 S + 2i _i=1 ^n-1 b_i S_i.   

This superpotential is finite in the limit when  and
 are taken to  and  respectively.
All physical information should be computed in that limit. The
logarithmic divergences in the contour integrals in  are
cancelled by the  dependence of . Now we can
identify the finite dimensionful parameter  with the
dynamical scale of the theory. Various special cases of this have
been discussed in
,,, . The term
with the integer constants  was introduced in  and
will be crucial below.  The last two terms in  can be
written as 
 where  (which we
sometimes abbreviate simply as ) is a real differential whose
 and  periods are  and 
respectively and which also has period minus one around 
. We will soon show that on shell  and  have the same
periods.

Here it is important to notice that, unlike cases studied in the
literature,  defined by  is not equal to the field
theory bare coupling . In field theory, the one loop
contribution to the superpotential implies that

 2i_0^ft  = (2N-N_f)(
_ft _0   ),  

where  is the scale of the theory. Up to now, we
have made the identification . Recall that
 was defined in the normalization of the matrix integral
. If we relax this identification, a new term has to be added
to the superpotential ,

W_eff _sphere  = _i=1 ^n N_i _0S_i  + (2N-N_f)( _ft ) S + 2i_i=1 ^n-1  b_i S_i.  

Note that  in  is independent of .
Therefore, we can take  and write,

W_eff _sphere  = _i=1 ^n N_i _0S_i  + 2i _0^ft  S + 2i_i=1 ^n-1  b_i S_i.  


Classical Limit Of  

A consistency check on  is to take the classical limit. In
this limit the Riemann surface  degenerates to 
. Therefore,  on the first sheet and 
 on the second. In the pseudo-confining vacua, i.e., when
all singularities of  are on the second sheet, the first term
in  gives  while
the second gives .
Combining this we get .
On the other hand, Higgs vacua are obtained by moving some of the
poles of  at points  from the second to the
first sheet. This has to be done through one of the cuts. Let us
denote by  the number of points on the first sheet obtained
by moving the  through the  cut. In this
case the contribution of the first term in  is unchanged but
from the second we get,

 _I=1 ^L r_I __I ^ _0 
R(z)dz + _I=1 ^L (1-r_I) _ _I ^ _0  R(z)dz = L W(_0 ) - _i=1 ^n k_i W(a_i) -
_I=1 ^L (1-r_I) W(z_I).  

Recall that  is zero if the pole of  at  is on the
second sheet and one if it is on the first sheet.

Using this in  we get,

 W_eff _cl  = _i=1 ^n (N_i -k_i )W(a_i) +
_I=1 ^L r_I W(z_I).  


Field Equations Of  

We now proceed to the study of the field equations of the
effective superpotential . Following , we replace
the dynamical variables  with the coefficients  in
. Clearly 
 are holomorphic
differentials for . Linear combinations of them with
coefficients which depend on  are the holomorphic
differentials . In addition to those we also have 
.
Where  was introduced so that the differential has residue
one and minus one at the poles of order one at  and 
respectively. Again, choosing appropriate linear combinations with
the holomorphic differentials we get . Now
consider the equation of motion of  by varying  with
respect to .  Since  is written as periods of ,
the variation is expressed in terms of periods of the holomorphic
differentials  and the meromorphic
differential . Appropriate linear combinations
of these give the following  equations,
  0 & = _i=1 ^n N_i __i _k +
 _I=1 ^L _ _I ^P _k  + b_k  0 & =_i=1 ^n N_i __i _P,P  +
 _I=1 ^L _ _I ^_0 _P,P  -
 _0^2N-L  B_L ^2N-N_f  - i (2N-L).  

We used that ,
 for  and
.

Comparing with  and  we see that these equations of
motion are equivalent to

 __i  T(z)dz = - b_i __n T(z)dz =-2i_0 = _0^2N-L  B_L ^2N-N_f  . 

Here 's are  integers in the superpotential .
Comparing  with  we find that  in
 differs by a factor of  from 
in . This trivial factor can be reabsorbed in the definition
of the normalization of the matrix integral . However, we
have chosen not to include it in order to avoid cluttering the
equations.


 

Alternative Proof 
Preliminary Discussion 

In this subsection,  we will present an alternative version of the
proof that on-shell  and  are
in the same cohomology class and in particular  has integer
periods. To make the ideas clear, we first present a simplified
version in which we ignore the fact that some of the differential
forms of interest have poles at infinity and also at the zeroes of
the mass function . Then we incorporate the poles, first
those at infinity and finally those due to .

So to begin with, we work on a closed Riemann surface  of
genus , with  a set of -cycles  and -cycles ,
.  For any closed one-forms  and  on
, we define
I(,)=_,  which
we will usually write in the alternative form
I(,)=_i=1 ^g
(_A_i _B_i -_A_i _B_i ).  As is clear from
,  if  and  are both
holomorphic differentials (in that case, locally 
, and ).  There is a partial
converse of this statement:

(A)  If  is such that  for any
holomorphic differential , then  is in the
cohomology class of some holomorphic differential , and
in particular  and  have the same periods.

The -periods  of a holomorphic one-form can
be specified arbitrarily.  But once this is done, the
corresponding -periods  are uniquely
determined. The formula expressing the -periods in terms of the
-periods involves the "period matrix" of , and
depends on the complex moduli of .  In our problem, even
off-shell, that is, before we fix the complex moduli of ,
the -periods of  are equal to integers  that depend on
the choice of a symmetry-breaking pattern.  We have the following
statement even off-shell:

(B)  For any choice of moduli of , the differential
 is uniquely determined by being a holomorphic differential
with .

If we combine statements (A)  and (B) , we arrive at the
following:

(C)  The cohomology class of a closed one-form  is
uniquely determined by the assertions that (i) 
 for any holomorphic one-form ; (ii) 
. If, therefore,  is any differential
form that obeys the same conditions, then  and  have the
same periods.

In the simplified problem that we will consider first, we take the
superpotential to be W=_iN_i_B_i +
_i b_i _A_i ,  where  is the meromorphic
differential , while  and  are
integers. We can write W=I(T_0,),  where
 is a closed (not necessarily holomorphic) one-form with
_A_i T_0=N_i,   _B_i T_0=-b_i.  We
also assume that   has the special property that, with
 being the moduli of , f_i =_i,  with  being a basis
of the space of holomorphic differentials on . (In our
actual problem, this is almost true, except that one of the
 has a pole at infinity. As noted above, we will
postpone incorporating the poles until we have explained the
structure of the argument.)

Using  and , the condition for a critical point of
, which is , becomes
. But given our assumption that the 
are a basis of the space of holomorphic differentials on ,
this condition says exactly that  for any
holomorphic differential . In other words, on-shell 
obeys condition (i)  in statement (C) . Since  also
obeys condition (ii)  by virtue of its definition , it
follows as stated in (C)  that  and  have the same
cohomology class on-shell. In particular, on-shell 
.

Incorporation Of Poles At Infinity 

Our goal now, as promised above, is to describe an argument with
the same structure, reaching the same conclusion, but properly
incorporating the poles that are present in some of the
differential forms in our actual problem.

In particular, in our problem, the differential form
 has a pole of order  at the points  and
 that correspond to  on the two sheets of
.  The singularities of 
 are milder; the  have at worst simple poles at 
and .

Likewise,  has simple poles at  and . If we
include fundamental matter, then  has additional poles, as we
have seen in section 4; for the moment, we consider the problem
without fundamental matter.


 The existence of all of these poles
means that the argument we have presented above does not quite fit
our physical problem. It also means that some regularization is
required in the definition of the superpotential.  We are going to
pick a regularization which is such that the proof of the on-shell
behavior of  will go through directly for the regularized
theory, without having to take the regulator to infinity.

Our method of regularization in this section will be to pick
points  and  that are "near" 
and   and to place the poles of  at  and
 rather than at  and .   We take
 and  to lie above the same (large)
value of  on the two different sheets; later we will keep fixed
this value while varying the moduli of the hyperelliptic curve
. It is important to note that in this
regularization,  is a solution to the anomaly equations up to
terms of order . By contrast, in the regulatization
of section 5,  was a solution to the anomaly equations before
taking the cut off to infinity.

Now let us explain the analogs of some assertions that we made in
our preliminary discussion.  Let  be the Riemann surface
with punctures obtained by deleting  and
 from the closed Riemann surface .  Let
 be a closed one-form on . Then if  is
a small contour circling once around  in the
counterclockwise direction, we may have
.  Likewise, let  be
obtained by deleting from  the punctures  and 
, and let  be a closed one-form on . Then if
 is a small contour circling once around  in the
counterclockwise direction, we may have .
We also let  be a path from  to
 (avoiding  and ), and  a path from
 to  (avoiding  and ).
 has a well-defined integral over , and  has a
well-defined integral over , but not vice-versa.  We
also let  and ,  be a complete set of compact  - and -cycles on the genus  surface ,
chosen to avoid the points  and
. In the problem studied in this paper, .
We make the above choices so that  and  have
vanishing intersection numbers with the compact cycles. This
condition identifies  with  and  with the
regularized version of , i.e., , as defined in
section 5.

Now we define I(,)=
_A_ _B_ -_A_P _B_P +_i=1 ^g(_A_i _B_i -_A_i _B_i ).  The notation  
 and also ,  is meant to suggest that
one can fruitfully think of ,  as extra -cycles
(for  and , respectively), and , 
as extra -cycles.Indeed, if one glues  to 
and  to , then after smoothing the
resulting singularities, one gets a smooth surface 
 of genus , with  and  as additional
-cycles and ,  as additional -cycles. 

 Finally, by an allowed holomorphic
differential on , we will mean a holomorphic one-form on
 that has at worst simple poles at the points  and
. Similarly, an allowed holomorphic differential on
 has at worst simple poles at  and
.An allowed holomorphic differential is
precisely one that corresponds to the limit of an ordinary
holomorphic differential  on the genus  surface 
 of the last footnote. 

The Riemann bilinear relations (see eqn. A.9)
 says that if  and  are allowed
holomorphic differentials on  and ,
respectively, then .This assertion can be
deduced from the fact that  for ordinary
holomorphic differentials  on ,
where here as  is smooth and  and 
are assumed to have no poles on , we use the
original definition  of .  Moreover, just
as in the absence of poles, this statement has a partial converse:

(A)  If  is such that  for any
allowed holomorphic differential , then  is in the
same cohomology class (and has the same integral over ) as
some allowed holomorphic differential , and in particular
 and  have the same periods.

The -periods  of a holomorphic one-form
 on   can be specified arbitrarily, along with
the value of . But once this is done, the
corresponding -periods  are uniquely
determined, along with .  The formula expressing
the -periods in terms of the -periods involves a generalized
"period matrix" of , and depends on the complex moduli
of .  In our problem, even off-shell, that is, before we
fix the complex moduli of , the -periods of  are
equal to integers  that depend on the choice of a
symmetry-breaking pattern, and we require in addition that
 (this being the regularized version of
the assertion that  has a pole at infinity with residue ).
We have the following statement even off-shell:

(B)  For any choice of moduli of , the
differential  is uniquely determined by being an allowed
holomorphic differential on  with ,
.

If we combine statements (A)  and (B) , we
arrive at the following:

(C)  The cohomology class of a closed one-form  on
 is uniquely determined by the assertions that (i) 
 for any allowed holomorphic one-form  on
; (ii)   and
. If, therefore,  is any
differential form that obeys the same conditions, then  and
 have the same periods.

Now, we let  be a closed one-form on  with
 _A_i T_0& = N_i                      _A_ T_0& = N                     _B_i T_0& = -b_i                     _B_P T_0& = -_0.  
Here  is the bare coupling of the gauge theory.

We define the regularized superpotential as W=I(T_0,),  where  is the familiar differential
.   is holomorphic on , but it
is not what we have called an allowed holomorphic differential, as
it has poles at  and  of order greater than one.
Nevertheless, the expression  is completely
well-defined; for its definition, it suffices that  be
regular on  and  on , regardless of the
nature of the behavior near the respective punctures.

Just as before, if  are the complex moduli of , then
the equation for a critical point of  is 
where .  Unlike ,
the  have only simple poles at the punctures and so are
allowed holomorphic differentials; conversely, any allowed
holomorphic differential on  is a linear combination of
the .  So the condition for a critical point of  is
precisely that  obeys condition (i)  in statement (C) .  Since  was also defined (in ) to obey
condition (ii) , it follows from statement (C) 
that on-shell, in other words  when the moduli of  are
chosen to get a critical point of ,  and  have the same
cohomology class. In particular, on-shell, 
and the periods of  on compact cycles are all integers.

Inclusion Of Fundamental Matter 

We developed in section 4 the necessary facts for including
fundamental matter in this discussion. Including fundamental
matter means that  has simple poles, with residue 1, at certain
points  on .  (The  may lie on the first or
second sheet; this choice will not affect our analysis and will
not be built into the notation.)  does not have additional
poles. So in defining , we omit the  as well as
 and , while in defining ,
we omit only the original punctures  and .  An
allowed holomorphic differential on  or  has
only simple poles at the punctures.

We let  be a small contour circling  once in the
counterclockwise direction, and  a path from  to 
avoiding all other punctures, and with vanishing intersection with
all the other cycles. For  a closed one-form on 
and  a closed one-form on , we define
I(,)=
_A_ _B_ +_I_A_I _B_I A_P _B_P +
_i=1 ^g(_A_i _B_i -_A_i _B_i ). 

All previous statements have obvious analogs.  If  and
 are, respectively, allowed holomorphic differentials on
 and , then .  This
statement has the partial converse stated as (A)  above.
We will omit copying this statement.

Moreover, (B)  and (C)  have obvious
analogs. The -periods  of a holomorphic
one-form  on  along with the values of
 and 
 can be specified arbitrarily. Once this is done, the
corresponding -periods  are uniquely
determined along with , and depend on the moduli
of .  However:

(B)  For any choice of moduli of , the
differential  is uniquely determined by being an allowed
holomorphic differential on  with ,
, .

If we combine statements (A)  and (B) , we
arrive at the following:

(C)  The cohomology class of a closed one-form  on
 is uniquely determined by the assertions that (i) 
 for any allowed holomorphic one-form  on
; (ii)  ,
, and . If, therefore,
 is any differential form that obeys the same conditions,
then  and  have the same periods.

The rest of the argument is hopefully clear.  We  let  be a
closed one-form on  with  
 _A_i T_0& = N_i                      _A_ T_0& = N                     _A_I T_0&=1
                                          _B_i T_0& = - b_i                     _B_P T_0& = -_0.  
We define the superpotential as .  The
condition for a critical point is, exactly as before, that
 for every allowed holomorphic differential
 on . Hence on-shell,  obeys the conditions
in (C) . Therefore,  and  have the same
periods and in particular .

The superpotential  has been
characterized so far by conditions on its critical points. This
still allows for an additive piece independent of the complex
structure of the Riemann surface . In order to fix this piece,
consider the classical limit in which the Riemann surface
degenerates to . This leads to  on the
first sheet and  on the second. Recalling that 
 and the conditions
, we get

 . I(T_0,)_cl  = _i=1 ^n
N_i W(a_i)+ (L-N)W(_0 ) - _I=1 ^L W(z_I).  

On the other hand the classical superpotential should be
. Therefore,

 W_eff  = I(T_0,) + (N-L)W(_0) +
_I=1 ^L W(z_I).  

In order to compare this superpotential with , we should
recall that the regularization procedure is different. The only
place this is relevant is in the integral of  along  and
the 's.  has a pole at  and .
However, the  solution to the anomaly equations has a pole at
 and . The difference of the integrals can be shown
to be equal to half the period of  around  up to
terms of order . This implies that the difference is
equal to . This accounts for the  term in
.


Interpolating Between Different Vacua 


We start this discussion by considering a certain process
involving variation of the parameters in our model.  We consider
an example that can be understood semiclassically.

Let as usual  be the zeroes of , and
 the zeroes of the mass function .  We
consider a classical vacuum with  eigenvalues of  set
equal to , leaving a  factor in the low energy gauge
group. Now consider a process in which, keeping the other
parameters fixed, one of the  circles counterclockwise once
around one particular  in the complex plane, chosen so that
.  Since  determines one of the quark mass
parameters in the effective  theory, in this process one
of those parameters changes in phase by .  For example, if
 and , then the quark mass parameter is
, and changes in phase by  when  circles
around . In the process, the theta angle  of the
 theory increases by .

Interpolation between different 
values.  Original configuration. Cycle  is shown. On
the upper sheet it is oriented from the  cut to the

respectively. The dashed line represents the motion in the lower

their original position completing the trajectory around the

.  inter.eps  


The periods of  integrated over certain cycles measure
differences between theta angles .  In particular, if
the  are the compact cycles described in figure 2, and we
set b_i=- __i T(z)dz,  then we have
 _i-_n=2b_i. 
When  circles around  and ,
we must therefore have b_ib_i+1. 

We could also have obtained the last formula by an argument
similar to that used in sections 2 and 4 to explain the change in
the  when  passes through a cut.  We will carry out the
discussion first in the pseudo-confining phase with . For
any given , the differential  has a pole of residue
1 at the point  corresponding to  on the second
sheet. When  migrates around ,  sweeps out
a closed path  that intersects the cycle . To
avoid the singularity, one should move the cycle 
continuously in  as  is moved.  By the time 
returns to its starting point,  returns as 
, where  is a small contour that wraps once around
. Since , this leads to
.

What happens if we consider the same motion of , but this
time in the Higgs phase, in which the pole associated with 
is on the first sheet at  (rather than on the second sheet
at )?  In this case, as   migrates around ,
 sweeps out a closed path  which intersects the contour
, but now, since the part of the contour  that is on
the first sheet runs in the opposite direction (if projected to
the -plane) from that in the second sheet, the sign of the
intersection number is reversed, Y_i=-Y_i.  To avoid the singularity, the cycle  must again
be varied continuously; it returns as , where  is a
small contour surrounding . We get , compared to
 in the last paragraph, because of the relative
minus sign in .  The opposite sign implies that in the Higgs
phase, with , the shift in  when  migrates around
 is , compared to  in the last
paragraph. The sign reversal can be readily explained in the field
theory. For , as , components of  and
 comprising a chiral multiplet in the fundamental
representation of  (plus its conjugate) become massless;
their contribution to the  beta function is .  For
, as , the expectation value of the adjoint
superfield  as well as  and  change in such a
way (see ) that the unbroken  is extended to an
unbroken .  The extra fields that become massless
consist of a vector multiplet in the fundamental representation
(the gauge fields that extend  to ) along with a
chiral multiplet (coming from ) plus similar multiplets in the
conjugate representation.  The total contribution to the beta
function of these fields is , where  is the
contribution of the vector multiplet. The opposite sign beta
function determines the opposite sign contribution to  from
integrating out these multiplets near .  In
getting the monodromy of the theta angle, the 2 in the beta
function is cancelled by the fact that, according to , the
expectation value of  (and hence the masses produced by the
Higgs mechanism) are proportional to . More
explicitly, the instanton factor of the low energy gauge group
 depends on the beta function.  Near 
it scales like  for  and
 for .  Therefore
depending on whether  or ,  changes by opposite
amounts when  winds around .

We can express the result  in the following fashion.  While
 is circling around , the position  of the
pole in  associated with  migrates around a certain closed
path  on our Riemann surface .  has intersection
number 1 with the closed contour , as indicated in the
figure 3. The transformation law of  is 
, where  is the intersection number of  and
. We can state this more invariantly by saying that for any
closed contour  in , when a pole of  passes around a
contour , the period of  changes by
_DT(z)dz_DT(z)dz+DC.  In fact, of the  and  cycles in figure 2, only
 has a nonzero intersection number with ; and only the
period  is expected to change in a
semiclassical process in which  circles around one of the
.  An even more invariant way to say this is that the
cohomology class of  changes in such a process by
, where  is the cohomology
class that is Poincare dual to .

In section 4, we considered a process in which one of the 
(or more precisely the corresponding ) passes through the
cut  onto the second sheet. We showed that in this process,
there is a transition from a pseudo-confining phase to a Higgs
phase, and a transformation .  Consider now the
following process that starts and ends at the same phase, which we
can take to be pseudo-confining:  we let  start on the first
sheet, pass through the cut  to the second sheet, and then
return to the first sheet by passing through the cut .
Clearly, in this process the 's transform by ,
, with no change in the others. This can be
regarded as another illustration of eqn. .  In this case,
one of the poles of  has made a closed circuit  from the
second sheet to the first and back again; of the canonical 
and  cycles of figure 2, the ones that have non-zero
intersection with  are  and .

Classically, the pseudo-confining phases are labeled by the
integers  with the restriction , as well as by
the .
 By iterating the processes that we have so far described,
we can (with a caveat explained shortly) change in an arbitrary
fashion the  and , so these operations connect all of
the pseudo-confining phases.  By combining these operations with a
further process in which some  move to the second sheet and
stay there, we can similarly connect pseudo-confining phases to
arbitrary Higgs phases.  The ability to connect all the phases in
this way should not come as a complete surprise, because in this
model, in contrast to that studied in , the presence of
fields in the fundamental representations prevents the existence
of precise order parameters involving Wilson and 't Hooft loops of
the underlying  gauge theory.

On-Shell And Off-Shell Continuation 

This discussion is subject to an important caveat.  As in section
4, we have here imagined changing  while keeping fixed the
Riemann surface .  But  depends on the resolvent
 and thus on the gluino condensates ; on-shell, the
 should really be determined by extremizing the effective
superpotential , and  depends on .  So in
general, when  is changed, the  and  will
change. A more delicate question now arises: if while changing
, one adjusts the  so as to remain on-shell, is the
continuation between the different phases still possible?

The process described  involving a change in the  when the
 circle around the  can be seen semiclassically and so
can certainly occur on-shell. The process in which  passes
through a cut, changing some , is more delicate as the region
with  near the cut is strongly coupled.  Intuitively, we
believe that when the  are large enough, the back-reaction
due to a single eigenvalue passing through the cut is small, and
hence it should be possible for all of these processes to occur
on-shell.  A bit of evidence in this direction is that for 
 super Yang-Mills theory with  gauge group and one
flavor, perturbed slightly to  by a mass for the
adjoint superfield, it is possible to have a smooth transition
from a branch with a condensed monopole and "confinement" to a
branch with a condensed quark and a "Higgs effect" .
The model is a special case (with , , linear ,
and quadratic ) of the model considered here;  the
interpolation found in  should correspond in our
current language to a process in which  passes through a
cut. (Moreover, the restriction to linear , etc., should be
inessential to the behavior when  is near a cut.) So this
indicates that a process lowering  by 1 by passing an
eigenvalue through a cut can occur even when . Subsequent
work on  theories with matter  similarly
indicates that such processes can occur for all .

For , however, we cannot expect to see a process in which
yet another  passes through a cut, reducing  to zero.
In such a process, the number of unbroken  factors in the
low energy gauge group would change; this cannot occur
continuously. It must be that the back reaction of a change in
 on  is crucial when a zero of  approaches a
cut  with .  This is not surprising, since the
infrared behavior of  gauge theory with massless matter is
completely different from that of  gauge theory without
massless matter, so the effect of the zero of  on the cut
will be large.

The Theory With  

As an application of the general results of the previous sections,
we now study the special case of the theory with . This
theory has a moduli space of vacua  parametrized by
 modulo conjugation by a unitary matrix. Alternatively,
 can be parametrized by the expectation values
 u_k=1k  ^k ,  k=1,...,N . 
Our goal is to compute the various observables as a function of
 or .

We start by examining the structure of  in the classical
theory.  At a generic point in , the fundamental  gauge
symmetry is broken to  and all the quarks are massive.  At
special points, there are singularities.   If  of the
eigenvalues of  are equal, there is in addition an
unbroken  symmetry.  When an eigenvalues of 
coincides with one of the zeros of , say , there
is also a massless "electron."

In the quantum theory, we expect the  singularities to be
replaced by monopole points, but the points with massless
electrons are IR free and are essentially unchanged. This
semiclassical picture is identical to that in the  
theory with  flavors.  Therefore, we expect the moduli space to
be described by the hyperelliptic curve 
.  We will soon see that
this is indeed the case.  It is therefore clear that if  the
metric on  is not positive definite at large  and the
theory is not sensible.  Note that this can happen even for
 where the gauge coupling is asymptotically free.  For
arbitrary polynomials , the standard link between
the beta function and the behavior of  on the moduli space
is not present.


As in , in order to study the theory at a generic point
in , we deform it with a generic superpotential  of
degree . We parametrize it as
 W'(z)=g_N_i=1 ^N(z-a_i). 
We study the theory for small  and then set  to zero. We
consider the vacuum in which the  gauge symmetry is broken
to , i.e. in which all . This leads to

 
 y^2= &  W'(z)^2+f(z)= g_N^2 y_0^2  y_0^2= &  P^2(z)-4^2N-N_f B (z), P(z)=
 (z - _cl )  

Equation  follows from  since  and  are
constants in this case.

For  this equation easily determines
 and .
Starting with a tree level superpotential with parameters  in
, the vacuum of the system is at a point in  which is
labeled by . When we
examine  below, we will see that for  in this
case .  For  this
identification is not so easy. The eigenvalues of  are
not the same as  in  and 
.

It is clear that  is proportional to  and therefore it
vanishes when .  Similarly,  is proportional to
 and it vanishes in this limit.  However,
 T(z) = z  ( P(z) +
 y_0(z)) = P'(z) y_0(z)  +B '(z) 2B (z)  - P(z)B '(z)
 2y_0(z)B (z)  
has a smooth nonzero limit as , and therefore  is
valid also when .

As a check, from  we learn that  (recall
that we use the value in the first sheet), and since  is a
polynomial,
 _I=1 ^L y_0(z_I)2 (z-z_I) =_I=1 ^L P(z_I) 2(z-z_I)  =[P(z)B '(z) 2B (z) ]_- 
Using this in  equation  becomes
  T(z)= B '(z) 2B (z) -P(z)B '(z)2y_0(z) B (z) + c(z) y_0(z)  
with another polynomial .  It agrees with our general
solution  for .

Now that we know , we can calculate
 u_k=1 k  ^k = 1 2i k 
 dz z^k T(z). 
For , we easily find that the gauge invariant coordinates on
 are given by 
(). The observables  with  are not given by
their classical values , but receive
quantum corrections which are polynomials in the instanton factor
.  These are quantum deformations of the
classical relations in the chiral ring.  This generalizes the
result of  in the pure gauge theory to the case with
matter.

For , we find a more dramatic result.  Even the
coordinates on , which are the generators of the chiral ring,
are not given by the classical expressions but receive instanton
corrections 
 ().

As we said above, these results are the same as in the 
theory with  flavors.  Equation  is thus an expression
for  in the  theory with matter.

Now that we have explored the theory with , we can turn
on an arbitrary superpotential .  The effect of this
superpotential can be analyzed as a small perturbation.  From the
structure of our equations is it clear that it cannot change the
value of  and that  and  are linear in .  The main
effect of the superpotential is to choose vacua - choose
 in .  Then various monopoles and electrons at
that point condense and lift some of the photons in these vacua.
But the curve  in these
vacua is unchanged.  The theory with nonzero  inherits the
curve from the theory with vanishing .

A Riemann Bilinear Relations. 

In this appendix we will give a brief review of the main tools
from the theory of Riemann surfaces used in this work. Most of the
results presented here are standard and are given for the reader's
convenience. For this review we followed .

A Riemann surface of genus  can be thought of as a  polygon
with some identifications of its edges. This representation is
particularly useful to get relations among the integral of
meromorphic one-forms along various cycles of the Riemann surface.
These are known as Riemann bilinear relations. Although, this
requires a particular choice of cycles and therefore breaking of
modular invariance explicitly, the relations obtained this way can
then be interpreted in any other basis of cycles by properly
deforming the contours. This is the source of the integer
ambiguity in all the formulas that refer to it in the main text of
this paper. In sections 3 and 5 where the different cycles are
explicit, the same choice has been made, which is consistent with
the discussion in this appendix.

For our purposes it is enough to consider meromorphic one-forms
with at most simple poles. Let  have simple poles at  and
 and  to have simple poles at  and . The Riemann
surface  of genus  on which  is defined has puncture at
 and . In order to get a simply connected representation of
it, we introduce cuts as shown in figure 4, the new surface 
is simply connected and  can be written as  on it.


Let us compute , where  is the
boundary of  shown in figure 4. We can evaluate this in two
different ways. The first is to deform the contour to enclose the
poles of  which we assume not to be located on .
Using Cauchy's formula this leads to,

_f = 2i f(R)res _R + 2i f(S)res _S . 


Polygon  representing a Riemann surface
 of genus . Cuts from  to  and to  are
introduced in order to make  simply connected. The path 
runs from  to  and back around the cut  and from  to
 and back around the cut . Also shown is the reference
point  in the definition of . The points  and 
are identified. Dashed lines represent the contours used in
integrals below.  polygon.eps  

Since  does not have any more poles, 
.  Using  we can write  as,

_f =  2i( res _R _S^R ).  

The second way is to use the contour in figure 4. From there we
conclude that,

 _f = _j=1 ^g ( _A_j f
+__j f +_A^-1 _j f + _^-1 _j f ) + _C f  

Letting  where  is an arbitrary point
in  (see figure 4), we can compute,

 _A_j f + _A^-1 _j f =
_A_j ( _z_0 ^z - _z_0 ^z' )  

where  and  are points on  and  respectively
that are identified (see figure 4). The two integrals of  can
be deformed to a single integral over the  cycle to give,

 _A_j f + _A^-1 _j f = -__j 
_A_j  . 

Likewise,

__j f + _^-1 _j f = __j  _A_j  . 

The last integral in  runs over the contour  and can be
computed by realizing that the value of  on one side of the cut
 differs from the value on the other side by .
Similarly, it differs by  between the two sides of the
cut . This implies that,

 _C f = _T_O^T+ _Q_O^Q =  res _T_Q^T. 

Combining , ,  and  we have,

 _f = _i=1 ^g (
_A_i __i - _A_i __i ) + 2ires _T _Q^T . 

Here we have also assumed that  does not have any more poles.

Comparing  and  we get the Riemann bilinear relation
which all relations used in this work are special cases of,

 2i res _R _S^R - 2i res _T
_Q^T  = _i=1 ^g ( _A_i __i -
_A_i __i ).  

Before illustrating the use of this formula, let us point out that
the cycles used to define the edges of the 2g-polygon are not the
same as the cycles in the double sheeted representation of the
same genus g hyperelliptic Riemann surface. These two sets of
cycles are in general related by an 
transformation. We have not distinguished them since the right
hand side of  is clearly  invariant. A more
important distinction arises when the two sets of basis differ by
the orientation of the resulting surfaces. In this case  can
be used by reversing the orientation of the  cycles. This
will be important in the first application of  given next.

As a first illustration of the use of  let us derive .
In this case we have  and . Recall
that  has zero periods around the  cycles and
poles of order one with residue  and  at  and 
respectively. On the other hand  is a holomorphic one form
with . The choice of orientation in
figure 2 is the opposite to that of figure 4. Therefore, as
discussed before, the sign of integrals over  cycles should be
reversed. Combining this in  we get ,

 __k _p_1,_2   = _p_2 ^p_1 _k.
 


As a second illustration, let us derive . Take 
 and . Recalling that these differentials
have zero periods around the  cycles, the right hand side of
 is zero. This leads to,

 res _R_R,S   _S^R _T,Q   = res _T
_T,Q  _Q^T _R,S  . 

Using that  and 
we get .

The derivation of  and therefore of  assumes that all
points  are distinct. In section 3 we need a degenerate
version of this, i.e., the case when . The integral in 
are divergent in this case and need a regulator. Without loss of
generality we can choose local coordinates vanishing at . Let
us then take  at . For  we can use
,

_S^_0,Q   =  _Q^0 _,S .
 

We need to express the integral on the right hand side in terms of
 and a regularized contour. The two integrals are not
the same but are related by exchanging the end of the contour with
the location of the pole. This operation introduces the integral
around half a contour around the pole and therefore gives a half.
Let us check this explicitly. We need to compute,

_Q^0 _,S  - _Q^_0 ,S .  

In the local coordinates we chose, 
 and 
. The regular terms will not contribute to  in the
limit , and therefore will not be considered.
Explicit evaluation of  gives 
. Therefore,

_Q^0 _,S = _Q^_0 ,S 
-i + () .  

Using this in  we get the general form of ,

 _S^_0,Q   =_Q^_0 ,S 
-i + () .  


B Sphere Contribution To Effective Superpotential 


In this appendix we will carry out the computation of 
 from the saddle point approximation result
. The answer is used to compute the sphere contribution to
the effective superpotential  of the field theory .
We will use standard matrix model techniques to calculate 
(for a review see e.g. ), and will express the
answer in terms of contour integrals. Similar computations can be
found elsewhere (e.g. in ), but we will keep terms
that were not important for the analysis there, and were not
explicitly shown.  We will also manipulate only finite quantities
making all dependence on the cutoff  explicit.

Recall that our normalization for the eigenvalue density is 
. Therefore, the filling fractions are

 S_j = _a_j^- ^a_j^+ d() . 

Consider  modified to include chemical potentials .

 _0(_i, ) = d()W() -dd()()  - _i=1 ^n_i _a_i^- ^a_i^+ d().  

This is a functional of  and a function of
's. 's will be introduced via a Legendre transform.

The variation of  with respect to  with
 a point in the -th cut is

 _0()  = W()
- 2 d(  - _i  =  0 . 

This is the equation of motion of .  It follows
from it that
  W'() - 2  d ()- =0 
where  denotes the principal part.

Although we do not need it here, we add for completeness a
derivation of the loop equation.  By multiplying  by
 and integrating over  we
derive
 
 d() W'()z-   =&
 2  dd  ( )((z- )( -  =&dd()( - (1z-   -1 z-  ) =& dd()( (z- )( z-  =&(d() z-  )^2
   
Since , 

 for any function  which is analytic on the cuts .
A special case of this is 


.  Using 

, we derive from
 the loop equation .

 From the equation of motion  we solve for 
 as a function of .  This
leads to the free energy with fixed chemical potentials

_0(_1,...,_n) = _0(_1,...,_n ,()) . 

Under a Legendre transformation

 _0 (S_1,...,S_n) = _0(_1,...,_n)+
_i=1 ^n _i S_i 

where

 _0(_1,...,_n)_i  + S_i = 0
 

is used to write .  The Legendre
transform (equation of motion of ) determines

 _0(S_1,...,S_n)S_i  = _i.  

Using  we find

 _0(S_1,...,S_n)S_i  = W() -
2 d( .  

Recall that  is a point in the -th cut. However, the
combination appearing in  is independent of  (see
). Therefore, a convenient  can be chosen to
evaluate . Take , i.e. one of the ends of
the -th cut. The integral over the cuts of  can
be replaced by a sum of integrals around the  cycles of
 as follows

_0(S_1,...,S_n)S_i  = W(a_i^+) - 2
_j=1 ^n _A_j  dz R(z)( z - a_i^+  ).  

Note that the integrand is not an analytic function on the cut
 but the logarithmic singularity does not lead to a
divergence there. The continuation of the function 
 into a complex function might introduce more
terms which are linear combinations of  with integer
coefficients. These terms are irrelevant for our computation since
they correspond to a choice of the winding number of the
regularized contours  around the  cycles as will be
clear from the final expression.

We now deform the contours in  to a contour that starts at
 winds around on a large circle of radius
, moves in along the cut of the logarithm to 
and back to  along the other side of this cut.  Using
, this leads to

  _0(S_1,...,S_n)S_i 
 =&W(a_i^+) + 2 _a_i^+ ^_0 R(z)dz - 2 S  ( - _0 )+
O (1/_0) =&W(_0) - _a_i^+ ^_0 y dz -
 2 S ( - _0 )+
O (1/_0).  

where we used .  Since  vanishes at
, we can write it as

_0S_i =  -__i y(z)dz
+ W(_0) - 2S (-_0  )+
O (1/_0).  

Now that the answer is written as a contour integral, the contour
can be moved through the cut  and does not have to pass
through .

Finally, we can write the sphere contribution to the effective
superpotential from ,

 W_eff _sphere   = -_i=1 ^n
N_i__i y(z)dz + 2i_i=1 ^n-1  b_i S_i +  N
W(_0) - 2N S (-_0  ).
 

up to terms of order .

Before concluding this appendix let us note that the free energy
 is a homogeneous function of degree 2 in the combination
of  and . In order to see this, consider
the definition,

 ( -N ^2S^2 _0 + ... ) =
1vol  U(N)  d ^N ^2   ( -N S  W()).  

where the ellipses represent higher order terms in the 
 expansion.

Recalling that , it is
simple to see that  can only depend on the couplings
through the combination . In addition,  can only
depend on 's through the filling fractions . Finally,
note that from the exponential in , the free energy has to be
of the form,

_0 = S^2 f( g_0S ,...,g_nS ,
S_1S , ...,S_nS  ). 

This proves the statement that  is homogeneous of degree 2
in 's and 's; i.e.

 2 _0 =_k=0 ^n g_k _0 g_k  +
 _i=1 ^n S_i _0 S_i . 




C Strong Coupling Analysis 

Once  has been found for the theory without superpotential,
we can repeat the strong coupling analysis of  for the
case when the deformation is by  of degree . This
will be a consistency check of the previous results since it leads
to the identification of the curves as in  and it is carried
out in the opposite limit, i.e. in the strong coupling regime.
The main reason this computation is nontrivial is that in the
quantum theory  is not given by  but we
have to be careful about the instanton corrections.

The superpotential for  is introduced as a small deformation
of the theory. This deformation leads to an effective
superpotential for the vev's of  denoted by
.

These vev's are computed from the generating function

 1z-   = N
z  +_l=1 ^  l U_lz^l+1    

 From  we also have

 1z-  =
z ( P(z) + P^2(z)-4
^2N-N_f B(z)  ) 


Using  and  we get

P(z) = z^N  ( -_i=1 ^U_iz^i 
) +^2N-N_f B(z) z^N   (
_i=1 ^U_iz^i  )   

Given that  is a polynomial of degree ,  can be
thought of as determining the coefficients of  and  for
 in terms of  for . It is important
to note that  is not equal to 
. From  the relation can be seen to be

 P(z) = (z-)+ [
^2N-N_f B(z) z^N   (
_i=1 ^U_iz^i  )]_+  


In order to use the deformation by the superpotential  to
fix a point in the space of 's for , we have
to take the degree of  to be . This implies that 
has to be written in terms of the lower traces. We will consider
all 's to be independent and impose the relation from  as
a constraint.

The deformation by the superpotential  gives an effective
superpotential for 's of the form

 W = _r=0 ^N g_r U_r+1   + R_0 (
z^N  ( -_i=1 ^U_iz^i  )
+^2N-N_f B(z) z^N   (
_i=1 ^U_iz^i  )   ) dz  

where  is a Lagrange multiplier imposing the constraint that
enforces  to be a function of the lower 's.

Taking variations with respect to , we get

g_r = R_0 ( z^N-r-1  (
-_i=1 ^U_iz^i  )-^2N-N_f B(z) z^N+r+1   ( _i=1 ^U_iz^i 
)  ) dz   

Using this we can compute  to be

 W'(x) = (  z^N  (
-_i=1 ^U_iz^i  )-^2N-N_f B(z) z^N   ( _i=1 ^U_iz^i 
) ) dz(z-x)   

where we have assumed that  in order to extend the sums
over  from  to infinity and perform the sum to get
. Here  is assumed to be inside the contour of
integration.

On the constraint surface,

 z^N  ( -_i=1 ^U_iz^i 
) = 12  ( P(z)+ P^2(z) -4
^2N-N_f B(z)   ). 

Using this in , we get

 W'(z) = R_0  P^2(z)-4
^2N-N_f B(z)  (z-x) dz 

Letting , this equation implies that

 y^2 = P^2(z)-4 ^2N-N_f B(z) = W'(z)^2 +
O (x^N-1 ). 

This is consistent with the result found in  and ,
i.e.

  y^2 = P^2(z)-4 ^2N-N_f B(z) = W'(z)^2 +
f(z).
