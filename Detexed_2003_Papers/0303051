ABSTRACT 


It is well-known that the standard no-ghost theorem is valid as long as the background has the light-cone directions. We prove the no-ghost theorem for the NSR string when only the timelike direction is flat. This is done by the BRST quantization, using the technique of Frenkel, Garland and Zuckerman and our previous results for the bosonic string. The theorem actually applies as long as the timelike direction is written as a  SCFT.

Introduction 


In the last decade or so, strings on curved backgrounds have been discussed widely in various contexts. Some recent examples are /CFT dualities, string on pp -wave backgrounds, and time-dependent orbifolds. However, many discussion is limited to backgrounds with light-cone directions (e.g. , string on pp -wave backgrounds and time-dependent orbifolds). Otherwise, the technology is often limited to supergravities (e.g. , for /CFT dualities).

This is due to the lack of the string theory on general backgrounds, especially the no-ghost theorem. As is well-known, string theory generally contains negative norm states (ghosts) from timelike oscillators. However, they do not appear as physical states. This is well-established for string theory in flat spacetime-. When the background spacetime is curved, things are not clear though. Standard proofs of the no-ghost theorem requires light-cone directions, i.e. ,  if the background is written as , where  is a unitary CFT. This is true both in the old covariant quantization (OCQ) and in the BRST quantization (standard_proofs )
(There are several attempts of the  proof in the old covariant quantization. For some discussion, see our first paper. We will also discuss them thoroughly in our future paper.) . 











However, the source of ghosts is the timelike oscillators and the Fadeev-Popov ghosts. Thus, one would expect that no-ghost theorem is valid even for  as long as the timelike direction is intact. In fact, in our previous paper, we show the no-ghost theorem for  bosonic string based on the BRST quantization. We heavily used the previous results by Frenkel, Garland and Zuckerman (FGZ). The purpose of this paper is to extend the proof for the NSR string. 

The proof by FGZ is different from the others. For example, the standard BRST quantization assumes  in order to prove the "vanishing theorem," i.e. , the BRST cohomology is trivial except at the zero ghost number. However, FGZ's proof of the vanishing theorem essentially does not require . Moreover, the power of the technique is not limited to the  case. This scheme is especially interesting because it does not even require that the timelike direction be flat; it admits an extension to more general curved backgrounds. As an example, we will discuss  case in a separate paper.

In the next section, we briefly review the BRST quantization of the NSR string. Further details and our conventions are summarized in appA  and . The reader who is familiar to the BRST quantization can directly go to the outline of our proof in outline . The presentation of the proof below is slightly different from our earlier paper, but the proof itself is very similar.








 
 
 
Standard schemes for the no-ghost theorem. 



Preliminary and Outline 



The Assumptions 

We make the following assumptions:
 

[(i).] Our world-sheet theory consists of  free bosons  and fermions  with signature  and a unitary SCFT  of central charge  (). Although we focus on the  case below, the extension to  is straightforward.

[(ii).] 
We assume that  is unitary and that all states in  lie in highest weight representations. From the Kac determinant (appC ), the weight of a highest weight state has  in the Neveu-Schwarz (NS) sector and  in the Ramond (R) sector. An example of  is a compact unitary SCFT, where its spectrum is discrete and bounded below. Another example is the transverse SCFT.




[(iii).] The momentum of states is .

In appA  and , we summarize our notations and conventions. 



BRST Quantization 


From our assumptions, the total  of the theory is given by 

L_m  = m  + m  + m ,

where , , and  represent the Virasoro generators in the  sector, the FP-ghost sector, and the unitary CFT  sector, respectively. In particular,

L_0  &=& k^2 + 

&=& k^2 + N + 0  + + ,










where  is the total level number and  () represents the normal ordering constant for the  (FP-ghost) sector. 

We will call the total Hilbert space . For the NS-sector, the physical state conditions are

Q phys   = 0

as well as 

b_0  phys   = L_0  phys   = 0.

The -condition follows from 
.
In addition, in the R-sector we impose

0  phys   = G_0  phys   = 0.

As in the -condition, the -condition follows from 
.

Thus, we define the following subspaces of :

(i) NS-sector 
 
 
 

(ii) R-sector 
 
 
 
Here,  denotes the -invariant subspace: 
. (Similarly for ) We will consider the cohomology on  since  takes  into itself from  and . (For the R-sector, also use  and .) The subspace  will be useful in our proof of the vanishing theorem (vanishing ).

The Hilbert space  is classified according to mass eigenvalues.  at a particular mass level will be often written as . For a state ,
 

One can further take an eigenstate of the ghost number  since .  is decomposed by the eigenvalues of  as 
 

We decompose the BRST operator  in terms of superconformal ghost zero modes:

Q = + (terms in  with superconformal ghost zero modes ).
        
See appA  for the explicit form of . Then, for a state ,
 
Therefore, the physical state condition reduces to
 
Also,  on  from Eq. relative . Thus,  defines a BRST complex, which is called the relative  BRST complex. So, we can define  by
 
and define the relative BRST cohomology of  by
 
In terms of the cohomology group,

.



The Outline of the Proof 


The full proof of the no-ghost theorem is rather involved, so we give the outline here. The terminology appeared below is explained later. The proof of the no-ghost theorem consists of 3 steps (outline ).

 

Step 1:
The first is to show the vanishing theorem . The vanishing theorem states that the -cohomology is trivial except at the zero ghost number. This is done by choosing an appropriate filtration  for your BRST operator . A filtration allows us to use a simplified BRST operator  and we can first study the cohomology of . If the -cohomology is trivial, so is the -cohomology; this is the reason why the filtration is so useful. However, the particular filtration used in standard proofs is also part of the reason why  in those proofs. 

Step 2:
The second is to compute and compare the index  and the signature  of the cohomology group explicitly. If the index is equal to the signature, the no-ghost theorem holds provided the vanishing theorem is valid.


Step 1 and 2 themselves consist of several steps, which are explained in step1outline  and  respectively.

In this approach, the matter Virasoro generators themselves play a very important role, and it is useful to have an additional step:

 

Step 0:
Write the matter Hilbert space in terms of products of two Verma modules, one for the  SCFT and the other for the unitary SCFT .


The step is useful particularly at Step 1.2 and is convenient when one discusses more general spacetime backgrounds.

 
 
 
The outline of the proof. 



Step 0: Hilbert Space via Verma Modules 


First step towards the no-ghost theorem is to map the  matter Fock space to Verma modules. This is essential for proving the vanishing theorem; in the language of FGZ, this means that the  CFT is an "-free module," which is a prime assumption of the vanishing theorem  (Theorem 1.12 of).

Moreover, expressing the Hilbert space in this general form is useful when one discusses CFTs other than the  case. 



Let  be a Verma module with highest weight  and central charge . Then, 

 

There is an isomorphism between a Verma module and the  matter Fock space:
 
(The index  and its sum is relevant only to the R-sector. See appB  and  for notations.)
At this stage, the Verma module implicitly defines an inner product on  which is a timelike part of . However, in the R-sector, the real inner product on  used in the no-ghost theorem is slightly different from the one by the Verma module (See App. B). This does not matter to the present discussion since here we only need to show that the states in the Verma module are linearly independent. We use the inner product on  given in App. B for the no-ghost theorem. Similar remark also applies to the expression hilbert . 




The isomorphism is plausible from the defining formula of  and ,

-m  &=& 2k_0 ^0 _-m  + , 
(m 0) 

-r  &=& 2k_0 ^0 _-r  + ,

where  denotes terms with more than one oscillators. The above relations also suggest that the isomorphism fails at . This is the reason why we require assumption (iii) in assumptions .

 [Proof of Lemma ]
The number of states of the Fock space  and that of the Verma module  are the same for a given level . Thus, the Verma module 

furnishes a basis of the Fock space if all the states in a highest weight representation are linearly independent. This can be shown using the Kac determinant (appC ). 































For , the Kac determinant does not vanish if 

<0 (NS ), 1/16 (R ),

so the states in the Verma module are linearly independent. Now, note that , where . Thus, Eq. roots  is valid for .

The isomorphism is valid as long as . Let us check what on-shell states actually appear in . From assumption (ii) of assumptions  and the on-shell condition, 
 

-(= (k^0)^2 - ) = + 0  + N,

where

NS 
	 
	 .,
	R 
	 
	 ..

In the NS-sector,  from Eqs. onshell . Also,  from assumption (iii). The Fock spaces with  are expressed by Verma modules. Those with  are not. However, there is no state in this region. In the R-sector, one always has . 














To summarize, the matter part of the Hilbert space  reduces to a sum of two Verma modules:
 
for the NS-sector, and similarly for the R-sector.
(See the footnote .)  
Throughout the discussion of the vanishing theorem in vanishing , we assume the above form of the Hilbert space. Consequently, the vanishing theorem is valid not only for the  case but also for more general backgrounds as long as the matter Hilbert space takes the above form. 




Step 1: The Vanishing Theorem 


Filtration and the Vanishing Theorem: General Discussion 


We now state the vanishing theorem for :

 [The Vanishing Theorem for String Theory]

The -cohomology can be non-zero only at , i.e. , 

H^n(H , )=0 for  n0

if the matter part of  can be decomposed as a sum of two Verma modules as in Eq. hilbert . 
To prove this, the notion of filtration  is useful. However, a particular filtration used in standard proofs is part of the reason why .

A filtration is a procedure to break up  according to a quantum number  (filtration degree):
 
where
 
In order that  takes  into itself, a filtration also satisfies
 
If  can be nonzero only for a finite range of degrees, the filtration is called bounded .

The nilpotency of  implies
 
since they have different values of . In particular,
 
The point is that we can first study the cohomology of . This is easier since  is often simpler than . Knowing the cohomology of  then tells us about the cohomology of . In fact, one can show the following lemma:
 

If the -cohomology is trivial, so is the 
-cohomology.

See, e.g. , Ref.  for the proof. 

Note that the above lemma states only for trivial cohomology; nontrivial cohomology for  is in general different from the -cohomology. However, one can show that the -cohomology is isomorphic to that of  if the -cohomology is nontrivial for at most one filtration degree. Then, a standard proof proceeds to show that states in the nontrivial degree are in fact light-cone spectra, and thus there is no ghost in the -cohomology. We will not take this path to prove the no-ghost theorem. However, the vanishing theorem is useful in our approach as well.

Now, we have to find an appropriate filtration and show that the -cohomology is trivial if . This completes the proof of the vanishing theorem. The standard proof of the theorem uses the following filtration: (The  piece is not really necessary. We include this to make the filtration degree non-negative.) 
 


The degree  counts the number of  minus the number of  excitations. So, this filtration assumes two flat directions, and we have to take a different approach for .

















The Outline of Step 1 



Since we want to show the no-ghost theorem for , we cannot use  as our filtration degree. Fortunately, the structure of our Hilbert space hilbert  enables us to prove the vanishing theorem using a different filtration. 

The proof of the vanishing theorem consists of three steps (vanishing ):

 

Step 1.1:
Apply our filtration a  la Frenkel, Garland, and Zuckerman. With FGZ's filtration,  can be further decomposed as a sum of two differentials,  and . This decomposition is crucial for the proof; it effectively reduces the problem to a "" SCFT, which contains the timelike part, the  and  ghost part. This is the reason why the proof does not require . 

Step 1.2:
If the -cohomology is trivial, so is the -cohomology. This follows from a Ku nneth formula. Then, the -cohomology is trivial as well from Lemma .

Step 1.3:
Now, the problem is reduced to the -cohomology. Show the vanishing theorem for the -cohomology. 



In this approach, the matter Virasoro generators themselves play a role similar to that of the light-cone oscillators in Kato-Ogawa's approach. In this section, we prove the theorem using the technique of Refs. , but for more mathematically rigorous discussion, consult the original references.

 
 
 
The outline of the proof of the vanishing theorem for . 























Step 1.1: Filtration 


Our filtration is given by 
 
The filtration assigns the degrees in filtration1  to the operators. FGZ's filtration is originally given for the  bosonic string, and it was later extended to the flat  NSR string. We can apply this filtration to our problem since it does not require  in principle.

 
 
















Filtration degrees to each modes for the vanishing theorem. 

The operator  satisfies conditions cond  and the degree of each term in  is non-negative. Because the eigenvalue of  is bounded below from Eqs. Hamiltonian  and on_shell , the total number of oscillators for a given mass level is bounded. Thus, the degree for the states is bounded for each mass level. Note that the unitarity of the compact SCFT  is essential for the filtration to be bounded.







The degree zero part of  is given by
 
 
Note that  () includes only  and  ( and ). Also, the matter part is included in  only. 
The importance of the filtration is that  naturally breaks up into two differentials  and  further. To see this, break  as follows:
 
 
Here, 
.
The Hilbert spaces ,  and  are decomposed according to the ghost number
:
 
where
 

b &=& N^b  + N^ , 

c &=& N^c  + N^ .

 Then, the differentials act as follows:
 
 
and . Thus, 
 and  
are complexes with differentials  and . Note that  is the differential for  as well as for . We consider the cohomology on  for the time being, but eventually relate it to the cohomology on .



Step 1.2: Reduce the Problem to the -cohomology 


The property that  is the sum of two differentials  and  has an important consequence. This reduces the problem to the "" part only; we show that the vanishing theorem holds for the -cohomology 
if  the theorem holds for the -cohomology. 
Then, in the next subsection, we see that this assumption for -cohomology certainly holds.

First, notice that we can always decompose a -closed state  into 
a sum of products of  and 
with  and :

^n = _b, n+b 0  _1^-b  _2^n+b . 

The superscripts denote their ghost numbers. Suppose that every  is -exact for nonzero :

_1^-b  = d' _1^-b-1 , b>0.










As a consequence, for  with , 

^n &=& _b -n>0  _1^-b  _2^n+b 


&=& d' _1^-b-1  _2^n+b .

Then,  is -closed since

0 
= Q^(FGZ) _0  ^n 
= d' _1^-b-1  (-)^b (d" _2^n+b ). 

So, each term in the sum kunneth1  can be written as

_1 _2
&=& (d' _1) _2


&=& (d' _1) _2 + (-)^b+1  _1 d" _2

 
&=& Q^(FGZ) _0  (_1 _2) for  .

To summarize, we have shown that
 

If  is -exact for ,  is -exact for .


We can understand 

this as a consequence of a Ku nneth formula. The Ku nneth formula relates the cohomology group of  to those of  and :

H^n (H ) =

_n=c-b c, b 0  
	H^-b ()
		H^c ()
H _K.


If  for ,

H^n (H ) =

	_n=c  
	H^0 ()
		H^c (F (c_-m ^ , -r ^ ))
	H _K,


which leads to  for  because . Then,  for .


The cohomology group we need is , not . However, Lian and Zuckerman have shown that 
 
Also, in the R-sector, by using the above result, it can be shown that  for . See pages 325-326 of Ref. . Thus,
 
We will later prove the Poincare  duality theorem,

(Lemma ). Therefore,
 
This is the vanishing theorem for .

Actually, from Eq. kunneth ,  does not include a state with . Thus, we have established a stronger statement:
 [FP-Ghost Decoupling Theorem]

Physical states do not contain Fadeev-Popov ghosts if  is decomposed as in Eq. hilbert .

Although the theorem itself is not necessary to establish the no-ghost theorem, it is useful to establish, e.g. , the BRST-OCQ equivalence. 


To summarize, our problem is reduced to the following lemma:
 [The Vanishing Theorem for the "" Part]

The -cohomology can be non-zero only at zero ghost number, i.e. ,  if
.


We prove the lemma in the next subsection.



Step 1.3: The Vanishing Theorem for the -cohomology 

We will now show the vanishing theorem for the "" part (Lemma ). The proof is straightforward using Eq. verma  and an argument given in.

 [Proof of Lemma ]
 Using Eq. verma , a state  can be written as
 
where the order in the matter part is the same as appC  and 

&& 0 < r_1  r_2  r_K , 

&& 0 < i_1  < i_2  < < i_L .

Note that the states in  all have nonpositive ghost number: .

 
 














Filtration degrees to each modes (for ) for Lemma lemma:vanishingforc=1 . 

We define a new filtration degree  as

N^(FK) _f    = -(K+L+M+N)  ,




which corresponds to the assignments in filtration2 . 
The operator  satisfies conditions cond . 
Note that the filtration is not consistent with the Virasoro algebra; a state  cannot be decomposed by degrees until one specifies the ordering of the Virasoro generators. Hence we take the above ordering. Similarly,  cannot be decomposed in itself; 
the degrees of  are determined after one chooses a state  and arranges 
 in the above ordering. 
In general, the degree of  is always non-negative and we would like to extract degree zero part 
 of . Since


d'   = 
( _m>0  c_m  -m  + _r>0  r  -r  ) 
 +(N^(FK) _f >0  terms ),

the -part comes only from the first term. The first term may still include  terms; the -part can be extracted only after one arranges the first term in the above ordering. 







Since we want a bounded filtration, break up  according to  eigenvalue  :
 
where
 
Then, the above filtration is bounded for each  since  is finite dimensional.








We first consider the -cohomology on  for each . Define an operator  such as

  =  


&& _l=1 ^M  -r_1   -r_K   
b_-_l   ( b_-i_1   b_-i_L   )
-_1   -_l    -_M   
-r_1  -r_N    


&& + _l=1 ^N  
(-)^L+l-1 
-r_l   ( -r_1   -r_K   )
b_-_l   b_-i_L  
-_1   -_M   
-r_1  -r_l    -r_N   ,

where  and  mean that the term is missing (When  or , ). Then, it is straightforward to show that
 
The operator  is called a homotopy operator  for . Its significance is that the -cohomology is trivial except for . If  is closed, then
 
Thus, a closed state  is actually an exact state if . Therefore, the -cohomology is trivial if  since . And now, again using Lemma , the -cohomology  is trivial if .

Because , we can define
 
Furthermore, as in Eq. LZ , the isomorphism
 
can be established. Consequently, 
 if .



Step 2: The No-Ghost Theorem 

Having shown the vanishing theorem, it is straightforward to show the no-ghost theorem:
 [The No-Ghost Theorem]

 is a positive definite space when . 


The calculation below is essentially the same as the one in Refs. , but we repeat it here for completeness.



The Outline of Step 2 

In order to prove the theorem, the notion of signature  is useful. For a vector space  with an inner product, we can choose a basis  such that
 
where . Then, the signature of  is defined as
 
which is independent of the choice of . Note that if , all the  are 1, so  has positive definite norm.

So, the statement of the no-ghost theorem is equivalent to 
(In this section, we also write
 and , where the subscript  labels different mass levels.) 
 
This can be replaced as a more useful form
 
where  is a constant or
 
where  and we have used the on-shell condition on_shell . The operator  gives eigenvalues .

Equation noghost3  is not easy to calculate; however, the following relation is straightforward to prove:

 
Here, the trace is taken over  and we take a basis which diagonalizes . Thus, we can prove Eq. noghost3  by 3 steps in noghost . Note that the trace weighted by  is an index .

The index is very similar to a partition function or a character  of a Virasoro algebra, but there is an important difference. The index sums over the on-shell states only. In flat spacetime, the mass-shell condition can be always satisfied by suitably choosing , so the index takes the same form as the character (apart from a zero-mode contribution ). In general, this is not the case though. 

 
 
















Strategy to prove the no-ghost theorem. 
 












Step 2.1 


 [Proof of Step 2.1]
At each mass level, states  in  are classified into two kinds of representations: BRST singlets  and BRST doublets , where . The ghost number of  is the ghost number of  plus 1. Therefore,  causes these pairs of states to cancel in the index and only the singlets contribute:
 
We have used the vanishing theorem on the last line.



Step 2.2 


 [Proof of Step 2.2]
At a given mass level, the matrix of inner products among  takes the form
 
We have used ,
 and
.
If  were degenerate, there would be a state  which is orthogonal to all states in . Thus, the matrix  should be nondegenerate. (Similarly, the matrix  should be nondegenerate as well.) 
So, a change of basis
 
sets . Finally, going to a basis,
 
the inner product  becomes block-diagonal:
 
Therefore, BRST doublets again make no net contribution:
 
This proves Step 2.2.

One can indeed check that  and  are nondegenerate. The inner product in  is written as the product of inner products in , superconformal ghost sector and . The inner product in  is easily seen to be diagonal and nondegenerate.



For the ghost sector, the inner product becomes diagonal and nondegenerate as well by taking the basis 
, 
, 
 and 
, where
 
 

 is assumed to have a positive-definite inner product. Therefore, the matrix  is nondegenerate. Consequently, the matrices  and  are also nondegenerate. 

The inner product is nonvanishing only between the states with opposite ghost numbers. Since  is nondegenerate, BRST singlets of opposite ghost number must pair up. We have therefore established the Poincare  duality theorem as well:
 [Poincare  Duality]

BRST singlets of opposite ghost number must pair up, i.e. , 

H^ (H , ) = H^- (H , ).



Step 2.3 


 [Proof of Step 2.3]
We prove Eq. step3  by explicitly calculating the both sides.


In order to calculate the left-hand side of Eq. step3 , take an orthonormal basis of definite 
,  [the basis diagonal_basis ],  and a basis of . Then, 
. 
Similarly, for the right-hand side, take an orthonormal basis of definite 
, , , ,  and an orthonormal basis of . 










 From these relations, the left-hand side of Eq. step3  becomes
 
When , one can rewrite it as

q^  C =  
	 .,

where  is the theta function with characteristics and  is the Dedekind eta function. The right-hand side becomes
 
This proves Eq. step3 .

Some Basics 

We follow the notations and conventions of Refs.  (These references occasionally use different conventions; in this case, the conventions of Ref.  supersede the ones of Ref. .) The basic (anti-)commutation relations are

[ ^ _m , ^ _n  ] = m _m+n   ^ ,
 ^ _r , ^ _s   = _r+s   ^ ,


 b_m, c_n  = _m+n ,
[r , s ] = _r+s ,

and .


The super-Virasoro algebra is given by

[L_m , L_n ] &=& (m-n) L_m+n  +  8  (m^3-m) _m+n , 

G_r , G_s  &=& 2 L_r+s  +  8  (4r^2-1) _r+s , 

[L_m , G_r] &=& m-2r 2  G_m+r ,

where .

The  matter part of the super-Virasoro generators are given by

m  &=& -1 2  _n Z  
                ^0 _m-n  ^0 _n                   - 1 4  _r Z +  (2r-m)
                ^0 _m-r  ^0 _r  
                + _m, 

r  &=& - _n Z   ^0 _n ^0 _r-n ,
where  and . . The superconformal ghost part is given by

m  &=& _n Z   (m+n) b_m-n  c_n  
	+ _r Z +  1 2  (m+2r) 
	m-r  r  
	+ _m , 

r  &=& - _n Z   
 1 2  (2r+n) r-n c_n + 2 b_n r-n  ,

where .


The ghost number operator  counts the number of ,  minus the
number of ,  excitations:

&=& _m>0  (c_-m b_m  - b_-m c_m ) 
	- _r>0  (-r r  + -r r ) 


&=& _m>0  (N_m ^c  - N_m ^b )
        + _r>0  (N_r ^  - N_r ^ ).

 is related to the standard ghost number operator  as 

N^g =+ c_0 b_0 - (1-2) -   - .

The ghost zero modes will not matter to our discussion. Note that the operator  is also normalized so that . ( denotes a ghost ground state. See appB .)

can be decomposed in terms of ghost zero modes as follows:

Q =

collection of the terms in  without , , , and .



Hilbert Spaces, Ground States, and Inner Products 


We first describe the Hilbert spaces ,
, and  more explicitly. 
In particular, we need an appropriate inner product on 
to establish no-ghost theorem.

We define the raising operators as , and  . We define that , and  are grouped with the lowering operators and , and  with the raising operators in . 
In the ghost sector, the ground state is given by , where

b_0   = 0,   = c_0   .

In the superconformal ghost sector, the ground state is given by

(i) NS-sector: 

&& r  1 2   = 0, r>0, 

&& r  1 2   = 0, r>0.

(ii) R-sector: 

&& r  1  = 0, r 0, 

&& r  1  = 0, r>0.


The matter R ground states  are given by a representation
of the gamma matrix algebra of .
It has 32-dimensional in  and 2-dimensional in ;
they are labeled by .

The Hilbert space , which is a subspace of 
defined by the condition  (and  in R-sector) as in Eqs. Hilbert_NS  and Hilbert_R ,
is represented as

H  =  
	 .

Here, e.g.,   is a Fock space spanned by 
all  ()
on the matter ground state .
A state in  is constructed by Verma modules of 
on a highest weight state . 

In the NS-sector, 
 is given by imposing -condition on  :
 
where  denotes the ghost ground state .
The inner product in the space  is given by

0,I;k,0_g   0,I';k,0_g   = _II' 

with the hermiticity property, 
 
Here  labels the states of the compact SCFT .
We take the basis  to be orthonormal. 
Note that the above hermiticity is consistent with the hermiticity 
of the BRST charge  on the inner product .
The relation of this inner product  with that 
in  is 

0,I;k,,1 2  0,I';k',,1 2  
	= 2 (k^2-k' ^2) 0;k,0_g ,I  0;k',0_g ,I' .

We write  as  in this paper.




On the other hand, in the R-sector, the space  is given by 
.
The -condition is the same as the NS-sector and it just 
gives the space  by imposing 
the condition  on .
To obtain , we have to impose the condition  on  further. The dimension of  is half of the space .
This is verified as follows:
First, note that  defines a complex on 
since  in .
If  is a -closed state, , then 
by using the relation , 

  =  G_0, ^0_0 ^0_0   
= G_0 ( ^0_0 ^0_0    ),

i.e. ,  is the homotopy operator for . Thus,  has no -singlets and only -doublets exist. The -daughter states contribute to  whereas the -parent states do not. Since the number of daughter states is equal to the number of parent states, the space  has half the states of . These daughter states can be written as .



Now we specify the base and the inner product of  when .
In this case, 2-dimensional fermion zero mode vector is 
represented, e.g. , by  with .
Define a 'world-sheet fermion number operator'  which counts the number of all world-sheet fermions without   in a state . (Note that  .)
The exclusion of the zero mode is the difference from the world-sheet fermion number used in the GSO projection.
In , where states are represented by Verma module of ,
the fermion number is defined by the number of 's .
Using this operator, we divide the space  into two spaces  and  as 

H ^a =  ; , k  (-)^f = a 

where  or .
Note that 

One can show that all the states in  or in  are independent,

so one can take either  or  as a base of .
We set the non-degenerate inner product of each of these spaces by the inner product of
 or  which is defined by 

0,I;s,k,0_g  0,I';s',k,0_g   = _s s'  _II' 

with the hermiticity property Eqs. hermiticity_property , where  denotes the ghost ground state . Our construction of the Hilbert space and the inner product is essentially the same as Ref. .

We can check that the structure (dimension of , signature and index) of these two spaces 
  under the above inner product are exactly the same. 
Thus, we perform the calculation concerning the no-ghost theorem 
in no-ghost  as follows:
First, consider the space  with the inner product
Eq. inner_p_R .
Then, calculate the dimension etc. in the space . 
Finally, divide these results by 2.
This gives the correct results on .
Note that the assumption  is crucial in the above discussion.



Kac Determinant 

For a  superconformal algebra, a Verma module  consists of all states of the form
 
where  and . Here, each  acts at most once since .

Consider the matrix of inner products for the states at level :

M _, N (, h) =
h, h,_i i  + _i = N.

The Kac determinant is then given by
 

det  [M ^N (, h)]_NS  &=& 
K_N _1 rs 2N 
(h-h_r,s )^P_NS (N-rs/2) ,



det  [M ^N (, h)]_R  &=& 
(h- 16 )^P_R (N)/2  K_N _1 < rs 2N 
(h-h_r,s )^P_R (N-rs/2) , 

where  is a positive constant,  positive integer and   even (NS), odd (R). We normalized . The multiplicity of the roots  is given by
 

_n=1 ^  1+q^n-1/2  1-q^n  
&=& _k=0 ^  P_NS (k) q^k, 

_n=1 ^  1+q^n-1  1-q^n  
&=& _k=0 ^  P_R (k) q^k.

The zeros of the Kac determinant are
at

h_r,s  = 16  + 1 4  (r _+ + s _-)^2,

where  (NS), 1 (R) and 

_  = 1 4  (1-  9- ).

In addition, the determinant vanishes at  in the R-sector.
