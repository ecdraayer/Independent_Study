We study a free particle on a -sphere in an extended phase
space, where the originally second-class Hamiltonian and
constraints are now in strong involution.  This allows for a
Hamilton-Jacobi formulation of the model, and enables us to
quantize the system canonically and to obtain the free particle
energy spectrum corresponding to that of a rigid rotator.

spectrum  The quantization of constraint systems has been extensively
discussed in the literatures .  In
particular, the embedding of a second-class system into a
first-class one , where constraints are in strong
involution, has been of much interest, and has found a large
number of applications . However, the importance
and usefulness of having the constraints in strong involution has,
in our view, not been sufficiently emphasized. To do this in terms
of simple
model is the main objective of the present paper.


(1) Quantum mechanics for a free particle on a -sphere 


Consider the motion of a particle on a hypersphere
, as described by the Lagrangian,
 
where   are the coordinates parameterizing
the   manifold, and  is the Lagrange multiplier
implementing the second-class constraint 
 associated with the geometrical constraint 
.(It turns out to be convenient not to impose
the constraint in the form .)   From the
Lagrangian () we obtain for the canonical momenta
conjugate to the multiplier  and the coordinates 
p_ =0,    p_a =q _a +q_a ,
 and the corresponding canonical Hamiltonian
reads
 
The usual Dirac algorithm is readily shown to lead to the pair of
second-class constraints  : _1 =p_ 0,   _2 =q_a p_a -q_a q_a 0,  satisfying the
constraint algebra with 
 

For the discussion to follow it will be of central importance to
convert this second-class constraints algebra into a strongly
involutive one, by suitably embedding our model into a larger
dimensional phase space.  Following the Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin
scheme , we systematically achieve this by
introducing a pair of canonically conjugate auxiliary coordinates
  with the Poisson brackets
 
In this enlarged phase space one systematically constructs the
first-class constraints  as a power series in
these auxiliary coordinates, by requiring that they be in strong
involution ,  _1 =_1 +,   
 _2 =_2 -q_a q_a p_ .
 Note that from here on all Poisson brackets
are understood to be taken with respect to the variables
 of the
extended phase space.

We next construct the first-class coordinates 
, corresponding to the original
coordinates defined by  in the extended
phase space. They are again obtained as a power series in the
auxiliary fields  by demanding that they be
in strong involution with the first-class constraints
(), that is 
.  After some tedious algebra, we obtain for the
first-class coordinates
 
In terms of these coordinates the first-class Hamiltonian can be
written in the compact form
 
It will be useful to note that this Hamiltonian is just the
Legendre transform of the first-class Lagrangian, which consists
of the Lagrangian () and a Wess-Zumino Lagrangian: L _0 =1 2 q  _a q  _a + 
q _a q  _a =1 2 q _a q _a +q_a q _a +
1 q_c q_c  q _a q _a  
-1 2(q_c q_c )^2   ^2 . In
terms of the first-class coordinates (), the strongly
involutive constraints () take the natural form  _1 =p _ ,   
 _2 =q _a p _a - q _a q _a ,
 which thus display manifest form invariance with
respect to the second-class constraints ().  One
readily checks that one has the following Poisson brackets: q _a ,p _b &=&_ab ,    
q _a ,q _b =0,    p _a ,p _b =0,

 ,q _a &=&-q _a ,   
 ,p _a =p _a ,   
p _ ,q _a =0,   p _ ,p _a =0.
 It follows from these Poisson brackets that
the constraints () and the first-class Hamiltonian
() are all in strong involution:  _i , _j =0,    _i ,H _0 =0.This will simplify the discussion to follow.  Indeed, since
the constraints are now in strong involution, we can impose them
strongly. Solving  for ,
and choosing  for convenience, we
may reduce the Hamiltonian () to the form H _0 =1 2 [p _a -q _a (q _b p _b )]
[p _a -q _a (q _b p _b )].
 Effectively we have thus again only 
independent degrees of freedom in the extended phase space to
describe the free particle motion on the -sphere.

On the other hand, from () one finds that these 
independent degrees of freedom satisfy the Poisson algebra
() which is evidently in accordance with the
first-class Lagrangian ().  Hence in the formulation of
the Hamiltonian () we can treat this free particle
motion as that of an unconstrained system.  This will prove very
useful in what
follows.



(2) Hamilton-Jacobi quantization 


If our Lagrangian would describe an unconstrained system,
we would have only one Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation for the
Hamilton principal function , as given by a partial
differential equation (PDE) of the form H^ _0 :=S t  +H_0 (t,
q_a ,,S q_a  ,S  )=0. If  does not depend
explicitly on , we may then seek a solution of the form
, with . In the case of our
model, the primary constraint  leads to an
additional PDE of the type H^ _1 :=S  +H_1 (t, q_a ,,S q_a  ,S  )=0,  where
 vanishes for the case in question, but has been kept in
() in order to streamline the notation.

Collecting  and  into the "vector"
 , the minimal requirement for
this system of equations to have a solution is that the
 be in strong involution:
. Since
, this is not the case. We are
thus forced to consider the first-class formulation of the model
in the extended phase space discussed above.  In this formulation
() and () are replaced by H ^ _0 =p _0 +H _0 =0,   
H ^ _1 =p _ +H _1 =0,
 where again , and the following
identification p _0 =S t ,   p _a =S q _a  ,   p _ =S   are understood.

Following the HJ scheme , one obtains from
(), the familiar Hamiltonian equations of motion for a
constrained system , dq _a  =H ^ _   p _a   dt _ ,   
dp _a  =-H ^ _   q _a   dt _ ,  with
 and
.  Explicitly
&&dq _a =(p _a -q _a  )dt,   
dp _a =(p _a -q _a  )
 dt

&&d =d ,                 
dp _ =0.  Since the algebra of the
first-class constraints () is strongly involutive, we
may implement the constraint  strongly.
Solving equation () for  and
substituting into (), we have now from () the HJ
equation H ^ _0 :=S t
 +H _0 (q _a ,S q _a  )=0,where  is
given by (). Note that due to the commutator
relations () we can now treat this free particle
system on the -sphere as an unconstrained system with the
Hamiltonian ().  The equations of motion ()
for  have thus become
irrelevant to our system.

Inserting the first-class constraint ,
together with , into (),
we can rewrite the equations of motion for the independent
variables  as follows dq _a =(p _a -q _a (q _b p _b ))dt,      
dp _a =(p _a -q _a (q _b p _b ))
(q _c p _c )dt. For the
differential of the Hamilton principal function these equations
imply dS=S t dt +S q _a  dq _a 
=p _0 dt+p _a dq _a 
=(-H _0 +p _a q  _a )dt,
 which can be integrated in time to yield
S=d t L _0 .  Hence
 can be identified with the action associated with the
first-class Lagrangian  on the space of solutions
of the equations of motion q  _a +q _a (q  _b q  _b )=0,
 following from ().

Next, we introduce a linear operator  corresponding to the
equations of motion () as follows X_0 f=f,H ^ _0 =[p _a -q _a (q _b 
p _b )](f  q _a  +q _b p _b f  p _a  ). From () we
see that  and  are canonically
conjugate variables, so that on quantum level [q _a ,q _b ]=0,   [p _a ,p _b ]=0,   
[q _a ,p _b ]=i_ab .
 In the Schrodinger representation, we thus
have for the quantum commutators, p _a =-i q _a  ,   
q _a =i p _a  .
Inserting these operators into (), we
arrive at X_0 f=i  [p _a -q _a 
(q _b p _b )][p _a -q _a 
(q _b p _b )]f=2i  H _0 f,
which shows that in the case of a free particle on the
-sphere we have only one quantum operator, namely the
Hamiltonian.

Following the symmetrization procedure of ref. together with () and (), we obtain for
the Hamilton quantum operator of a free particle on the
-sphere, H _0 &=&:1 2 (-i q _a   +iq _a q _c  q _c  )(-i q _a  
+iq _a q _c  q _c  ):

&=&1 2 ^2 [-^2  q _a q _a  +(n-1)q _a  q _a  +q _a q _b  q _a   q _b  +(n+1)(n-3) 4 
].  Note that the quantum Hamiltonian
() has only terms of order , so that one
has rotational energy contributions of order , without
any vibrational modes of order . In fact, the starting
Lagrangian () does not possess any vibrational degrees of
freedom, since it involves only the kinetic term describing the
motions of the particle residing on the  manifold.

We now define the Casimir operator  in terms of the
-sphere Laplacian  J ^2 =^2 [-^2  q _a q _a  +(n-1)q _a  q _a  +q _a q _b  q _a   q _b  ], whose eigenvalue spectrum is given in terms of the
corresponding angular quantum number   and
the dimension of the sphere as follows J ^2 l2 l(l+n-2)l. We thus
have for the Hamiltonian operator of a free particle on the
-sphere H _0 =1 2 [J ^2 +^2 (n+1)(n-3) 4 ],
 to yield the eigenvalue equation
 with the spectrum given by
E_l =^2  2 [l(l+n-2)+(n+1)(n-3) 4 ].Note that the Hamiltonian operator () is that
of a rigid rotator, and the energy eigenvalues ()
involve global shifts depending on the dimension of the sphere,
which has not been included in the
references .

Finally, we return to the first-class Hamiltonian (),
where the variable  has not yet been eliminated
using the constraint . Corresponding to
 and  in (), we
introduce linear operators   in the
extended phase space

, defined by X_ f=f,H ^ _ =f  q _a   H ^ _  p _a   -H ^ _  q _a   f p _a   ,where  is an
arbitrary freedom of the phase space variables.  One readily
checks that  and  are given by X_0 =(p _a -q _a  )( q _a  +   p _a  ),   X_1 =    
 and satisfy the closed Lie algebra [X_0 ,X_1 ]=0,  in agreement with the
general relation

  and ().
Moreover, one can easily check that, corresponding to the degrees
of freedom of , there exist 
satisfying
. Note that
the equations of motion in this formulation read q  _a +q _a   =0.Using the constraint (), we can eliminate
, to put this equation into the form
().

In conclusion, it can be said that the Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin
embedding of the second-class constrained system into a
first-class one has played a central role in our problem for
obtaining the energy spectrum, as well as a Hamilton-Jacobi
formulation of our model.
