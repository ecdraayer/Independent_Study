Abstract 


We develop a perturbative approach to the solution of the scalar wave equation
for a large AdS black hole. In three dimensions, our method coincides with the
known exact solution. We discuss the five-dimensional case in detail and apply our
procedure to the Heun equation. We calculate the quasi-normal modes analytically
and obtain good agreement with numerical results for the low-lying frequencies.




Quasi-normal modes describe small perturbations of a black hole at equilibrium .
A black hole is a thermodynamical system whose (Hawking) temperature and
entropy are given in terms of its global characteristics (total mass, charge
and angular momentum). In general, quasi-normal modes are obtained by solving
a wave equation for small fluctuations subject to the conditions that the
flux be ingoing at the horizon and outgoing at asymptotic infinity. One then
obtains a discrete spectrum of complex frequencies. The imaginary part of these
frequencies determines the decay time of the small fluctuations. On account
of the AdS/CFT correspondence, the quasi-normal modes for an AdS black hole
are expected to
correspond to perturbations of the dual CFT. The establishment of such a
correspondence is hindered by the difficulties in solving the wave equation.
In three dimensions, the wave equation is a hypergeometric equation and can therefore be solved . In five dimensions, the wave equation turns into
a Heun equation which is unsolvable . Numerical results have been obtained
in four, five and seven dimensions .

We discuss an analytic method of solving the wave
equation in the case of
a large black hole living in AdS space. The method is based on a
perturbative expansion
of the wave equation in the dimensionless parameter , where 
is the frequency of the mode and  is the (high) Hawking temperature of the black hole.
Such an expansion is no trivial matter, for the dependence of the wavefunction on  changes as one moves from the asymptotic boundary of AdS space to the horizon
of the black hole.
The zeroth-order approximation is chosen to be an appropriate hypergeometric equation so that higher-order corrections are indeed of higher order in .
In three dimensions, this hypergeometric equation is exact. In five dimensions,
we show that the low-lying quasi-normal modes obtained from the zeroth-order approximation are in good agreement with numerical results .
The first-order correction is also calculated.
Our method is generalizable to higher dimensions where the number of singularities of the wave equation is larger.



The metric of a -dimensional AdS black hole may be written as
ds^2 = ( r^2 R^2  +1 - _d-1  M r^d-3   ) dt^2 + dr^2  ( r^2 R^2  +1 - _d-1  M r^d-3   )   +r^2 d _d-2 ^2
where  is the AdS radius and  is the mass of the black hole.
For a large black hole, the metric simplifies to
ds^2 = ( r^2 R^2  - _d-1  M r^d-3   ) dt^2 + dr^2  ( r^2 R^2  - _d-1  M r^d-3   )   +r^2 ds^2 (E ^d-2 )
The Hawking temperature is
T_H = d-1 4  r_h R^2 
where  is the radius of the horizon,
r_h = R [ _d-1  M R^d-3   ] ^1/(d-1) 
The scalar wave equation is
eq5 
1 g   _A g g^AB _B = m^2 We are interested in solving this equation in the massless case () for
a wave which is ingoing at the horizon and vanishes at infinity. These boundary
conditions yield a discrete set of complex frequencies (quasi-normal modes).



We start with a review of the three-dimensional case where the assumption of a
large black hole is redundant and the wave equation may be solved exactly.
Indeed, in three dimensions
, the metric reads
ds^2 = 1 R^2  ( r^2 -r_h^2 ) dt^2 +R^2 dr^2  ( r^2 - r_h^2 )  + r^2 dx^2
independently of the size of the black hole.
The wave equation is
1 R^2 r _r ( r^3 ( 1- r_h^2 r^2 ) _r ) -R^2 r^2 - r_h^2  _t^2 + 1 r^2 _x^2 -m^2=0 The solution may be written as
= e^i(t-px)  (y) ,     y = r_h^2 r^2 
where  satisfies
y^2 (y-1)( (y-1) )' +^2 y+p^2 y(y-1)+m^2 (y-1)= 0
in the interval , and we have introduced the dimensionless variables
= R^2 2r_h  =  4T_H ,   p^2 = pR 2r_h  = p 4R T_H ,m = mR
Two independent solutions are obtained by examining the behavior near the horizon
(),
eq11  _(1-y)^i where  is outgoing and  is ingoing. A different set of linearly
independent solutions is obtained by studying the behavior at large  ().
We obtain
y^h_ 
,h_= 1 2  1 2 1 +m^2 
In the massless case (), we have  and , so one of the
solutions contains logarithms. For quasi-normal modes, we are interested in the
analytic solution. This may be written in terms of a Hypergeometric function as
(y) = y(1-y)^i   _2F_1 (1+i(+ p), 1+i(- p); 2; y)Near the horizon, this solution is a mixture of ingoing and outgoing waves. Using
standard identities involving Hypergeometric functions, we obtain
A (1-y)^-i  + B(1-y)^i where
eq15  A=
(2i) (1+i(+ p))(1+i(- p)) 
,B= (-2i) (1-i(+ p))(1-i(- p)) as . Since  must be a linear combination of  and ,
we deduce
= A_- + B_+on account of eq. ().
For quasi-normal modes, we demand that  be purely ingoing at the horizon, so
we need to set
B=0with  given in ().
The solutions to this equation are the quasi-normal frequencies. Explicitly,
= p  -in,n=1,2,a discrete set of complex frequencies with negative imaginary part, as expected . Notice that we obtained two sets of frequencies, with opposite real parts.













In five dimensions (), the wave equation () reads
1 r^3 _r r^5( 1- r_h^4 r^4  ) _r -R^4  r^2 ( 1- r_h^4 r^4  )  _t ^2- R^2 r^2  ^2- m^2R^2= 0
Let 

= e^i(t - px)  (r)
and change parameter  to ,
y = r_h^2 r^2  
The wave equation then becomes
y^3 (1-y^2)( 1 y (1-y^2) )' + ^2 4  y+ p^2 4  y(1-y^2)- m^2 (1-y^2)=0
where
= R^2 r_h  =  T_H ,     
p = pR r_h  = p R T_H ,     
m = m R
Near the horizon we obtain in- and out-going waves
_(1-y)^i/4 At large  () there is only one analytic solution for  (the other
one contains logarithms). It may be written as
eq25 
(y) = y^2(1-y)^-i/4  (1+y 2  )^-/4  F(y)
where we isolated the singularities at . We divided  by
 in order not to obtain a contribution from this factor at the horizon
(). This introduces an irrelevant constant, but one ought to be careful
with  dependent constants in perturbation theory (expansion in ). It should also be pointed out that we could have chosen the exponent  instead of  at the  singularity (eq. ()). This does not alter the
quasi-normal modes, but in the perturbative expansion, each choice only produces
half the modes. The two sets of modes have the same imaginary parts, but opposite
real parts, as we shall see.

 is the Heun function satisfying the equation 





F" + ( 3 y  +1-i/2 y-1  +1-/2 y+1  ) F'
+ (2-(1+i)/4)^2 y -q y(y^2-1)  F =0 where
q = 3(-1+i) 4 -p^2 4  +^2 4 
To find the behavior of  near the horizon, let us write the Heun equation as
(H _0 +H _1) F = 0where
H _0 &=& x(1-x)d^2 dx^2  + (2-1-i 4   1+i 4   )x)d dx  -
1 4  ((2-1+i 4   )^2-q)

H _1 &=& (1-x) (1-i 4   d dx  + q 4x  )and we changed variables to . We shall treat  as a perturbation. It has been chosen so that the perturbation series is an expansion in
. Expanding the wavefunction,
F = F_0 + F_1 + the zeroth-order equation
H _0 F_0 = 0has analytic solution the Hypergeometric function
eq32  F_0(x) =  _2F_1 ( 1+(-1+i 4   +q)/2, 1+(-1+i 4   q)/2; 2-1-i 4   ; x)Its behavior at the horizon () is
F_0(x) A_0 + B_0 (1-x)^i/2 where
A_0 &=& (2-1-i 4   )(i/2) (1-(1-3i 4   +q)/2)
(1-(1-3i 4   -q)/2) 

B_0 &=& (2-1-i 4   )(-i/2) (1-(1+i 4   +q)/2)
(1-(1+i 4   -q)/2) An approximation to the quasi-normal modes is obtained by setting
eq1  B_0 = 0The solutions to this equation are
1+i 4   q = 2n,     n= 1,2,For , they are shown on Table 1, column (a) . They all have negative real parts. The set of modes with positive real parts
may be obtained by replacing the factor 
with  in eq. () (capturing the alternative behavior of the
wavefunction near the singularity ). The low-lying frequencies
are close to the exact values obtained by numerical methods (Table 1,
column (c)  ).
For first-order perturbation theory, we need the expansion of  in ,
eq37  B_0 = 1 -i/2    1 + ( -1 + ^2 8  ) 1-i 4   + To calculate the first-order correction, we also need
another linearly independent solution of the zeroth-order wave equation.
We shall use
eq38  G_0(x) = F_0(x)^x W_0(x') dx' (F_0(x'))^2 where  is the Wronskian
W_0 F_0G_0' - G_0F_0' = x^-2+(1-i)/4  (1-x)^-1+i/2 The equation satisfied by the first-order contribution to the wavefunction  is
H _0 F_1 = -H _1 F_0The solution (satisfying ) may be written as
eq41  F_1(x) =
G_0(x)_0^x F_0(x')H _1 F_0(x') dx' W_0(x') 
- F_0(x)_0^x G_0(x')H _1 F_0(x') dx' W_0(x') Expanding in , we obtain from eqs. () and (),
respectively,
F_0(x) = 1-(1-x)^i/2  i x/2  + ,G_0(x) = -1 x  + The first term in  (eq. ()) does not contribute at lowest order. After some algebra, we arrive at
F_1(x) = C 1-i 4    F_0(x) + where
C &=& _0^1 dx  -1 x(1+x)  - 1-x x^2 
( 1 + 3x 4  ) (1-x) 

&=& 1+2-^2 8  Notice that the divergences from the contributing terms in the integral in eq. () at
both ends () all cancel each other, resulting in a finite expression for
, as required for the validity of our perturbative expansion.
To first order, the behavior at the horizon is
F(x) F_0(x) + F_1 (x) A_1 + B_1 (1-x)^i/2 Using eqs. () and (), we obtain
eq46  B_1 = B_0 + 1-i 2    C = 1 -i/2   1 + 2 1-i 4   + At this order, we obtain an approximation to the lowest quasi-normal frequency
by setting  in eq. (). We find
eq2  _1 = -2(1+i) 2  = -2.89 (1+i)which is a good approximation to the exact result 
 obtained by numerical techniques . (The mode with
positive real part is obtained by replacing the exponent 
by  at the singularity  (eq. ()), as already explained). Higher-order modes may be obtained by calculating higher-order perturbative corrections.
At the th perturbative order we obtain an th order polynomial in  whose roots
are an approximation to the  lowest quasi-normal frequencies.

Our method may
be straightforwardly extended to higher dimensions even though the wave equation
possesses more (complex) singularities than the Heun equation in five dimensions. It would be interesting to investigate the implications
of our perturbative approach to the AdS/CFT correspondence.
