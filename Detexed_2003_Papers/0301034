Abstract 




Starting from  scalar and vector supermultiplets in 2+1 dimensions, we
construct superfields which constitute Lagrangians invariant under 
supersymmetries. We first recover the  supersymmetric Abelian-Higgs model
and then the  pure super Yang-Mills model. The conditions for this 
elevation are consistent with previous results found by other authors.





 supersymmetry in 2+1 dimensions had been studied
 in order to
investigate the supersymmetrization of the instantons effects which lead
to a linear confinement.
Since then, systematic studies of  supersymmetry in 2+1
dimensions have been done
in where exact results were obtained,
such as
superpotentials and topologies of moduli spaces in various cases.

These exact results can be derived
since  supersymmetry in 2+1 dimensions can be obtained by
dimensional reduction of  supersymmetry in 3+1 dimensionsand thus has similar properties, such as non-renormalization theorems.
These theorems are not
present for  supersymmetry in 2+1 dimensions
and it is thus interesting to study its elevation to .
In this context,
it was shown that the presence of topologically
conserved currents
leads to a centrally extended  superymmetry, the
central charge of the
superalebra being the topological charge.
In, the  supersymmetric Abelian-Higgs model
was considered and it was shown that the on-shell Lagrangian can be
extended to the 
Abelian-Higgs model if a relation is imposed between the gauge
coupling
and the Higgs self-coupling. Such a condition is in general expected in a
 invariant theory built out of  Lagrangians.
Another example of extension 
was given in where  supersymmetries of composite
operators
was elevated to a  Abelian model, up to irrelevant operators.
In this work, the coupling of matter to the gauge field
was obtained with higher order composites, simulating the dynamical
generation of the 
supersymmetry that would occur after an appropriate functional
integration of a
gauge field coupled to the original  supermultiplets.

We propose here another illustration of the supersymmetry extension,
with the superfield construction of  Lagrangians in
terms of 
scalar and vector superfields.
The  superspace in 2+1 dimensions contains only one real
two-component Grassmann coordinate 
and the invariant actions are integrals over superspace which involve 
.
The Lagrangians are constructed out of superfields which mix the
original 
superfields in such a way that a  supersymmetric transformation
on the original superfields
leaves the  Lagrangians invariant. 

We first consider the pure  case and
then add matter so as to construct the
Abelian Higgs model, using a Fayet-Iliopoulos term.
We finally make a superfield construction for the
 pure Yang-Mills Lagrangian.
As will be seen, the present contruction exhibits naturally the
conditions found in and for the elevation of a 
to a  supersymmetry.




The gamma matrices are given by
,
where  are the Pauli matrices, such that

and .
We have the following usual properties, valid for any
2-component complex spinors :

In 2+1 dimensions, the  scalar superfield and the  vector
superfield in the Wess-Zumino gauge
are respectively given by

&=&+()+^2 DV_&=&i(A)_+^2_,
where all the fields are real.
To form an  supermultiplet, we define the complex gaugino
.
The two fermionic degrees of freedom then
balance the two bosonic ones, since  has one degree of freedom
.
The (complex) scalar superfield  containing these degrees of freedom is

G&=&+iD^V_

&=&+()+^2 D^2+i_A_(^^),
where the superderivative is
.
Consider now the superfield

D^G=-^A_(^^)^+i()^+i(_)
(^)^.
With the properties (), it is easy to see that

d^2D^G D_G&=&
-F^ F_ +i+_^+D^2&&+(^A_)^2+surface term ,
where the surface term is
 and 
.
If the gauge condition  is imposed, we find then
the  Abelian gauge
kinetic term. This gauge condition was found in where  is given 
the role af a conserved current, necessary to elevate the  supersymmetry to 
, and it reflects the fact that we work in the Wess-Zumino gauge. 
Disregarding the surface term, the expected  Lagrangian is then
expressed in terms of the original  superfields as follows:

lgauge 
L _gauge &=&d^2D^G D_G&=&-1 4 F^ F_ +i 2 +_^+D^2.



Matter is included with a complex  scalar superfield :

Q=+()+^2 F.
So as to avoid the generation
of parity violating terms in the quantum corrections,
we can introduce an even number of superfields, but we do not consider
this problem here. 
We remind that a  scalar superfield in 2+1 dimensions cannot be
chiral:
since  is real, the chirality
condition  would constraint the space-time dependence of
the component fields
.

The derivatives of the fields are obtained with the highest component
of
 which reads

.D^Q D_Q_^2 =
^2(_^+i+FF+
surface term ),
where the surface term is
.
The coupling to the gauge multiplet
is obtained with the highest components of the following superfields:

.D^QV_Q_^2 &=&-^2
(()-A_^+iA).QQ_^2 &=&^2
(D-F+F-
).QV^V_Q_^2 &=&-^2A^A_,
such that the matter Lagrangian is

L _matter 
&=&d^2(D^Q
+2gQQ&=&i 2 D+D_D^g 2 (+
)-g 2 &&+g 2 D+FF+g 2 F+g 2 F,
where  is a dimensionfull gauge coupling and
. The Lagrangian 
() was found in as
a consequence of the dimensional reduction of a  theory in 3+1 dimensions.



We can recover the
scalar interactions if we write the Lagrangians () and
() on-shell.
We write for this the equations of motion of the auxiliary fields 
and :

F+g&=&0D+g 2 &=&0,
such that the terms depending on the auxiliary fields
lead to the following potential

(L _gauge +L _matter )_pot &=&
D^2+g 2 D+FF+g 2 F+
g 2 F&=&-g^2 2 ^2g^2 8 ()^2.
The Abelian Higgs model is obtained by adding a
Fayet-Iliopoulos term which in
the present context is

L _F.I. =-g 2 _0^2d^2(G+G)
=-g_0^2d^2g 2 _0^2 D,
where  is a real parameter.
The addition of this term to the Lagrangian leads to the following
equation of motion
for the auxiliary field :

D+g 2 g 2 _0^2=0,
such that we obtain the expected gauge-symmetry breaking potential

lah 
(L _gauge +L _matter +L _F.I. )_pot 
=-g^2 2 ^2g^2 8 (Note that the Higgs self-coupling is , what was found inas a consistency condition for the elevation of the  on-shell Lagrangian
to .
The result () shows that the moduli space contains a
Higgs branch only,
where the vacuum expectation values of the scalar fields satisfy

<>=_0^2     and      <>=0.


The extension to a non-Abelian gauge group necessitates the
introduction of quadratic
superfields to generate the interactions. We will consider 
dynamics, with
structure constants  and coupling constant .
A non-Abelian supermultiplet contains gauginos and scalars in the
adjoint representation, so that
the starting point is the set of scalar and vector  superfields

^a&=&^a+(^a)+^2D^aV_^a&=&i(A^a)_+^2^a_,
where  is the gauge indice.
We then introduce the complex superfields

G^a=^a+iD^V^a_,
and, as in the Abelian case, the derivatives of the component fields are obtained with
the term , provided that the gauge condition
 holds.
To generate the interactions of the superpartners, we will add to
 linear combinations of the following two superfields

G^bV^c ,        D^(V^b  V^c_),
and the remaining terms for the covariant derivatives
are obtained with the products

quad1 
.f^abc D^G^a G^b V^c__^2 &=&
^2f^abc (-^b^a^c+(i^bA^c^a+c.c .)
-2^b^^a A_^c).f^abc f^ade G^bV^c G^d V^e__^2 &=&
f^abc f^ade ^2^b^d A_^c A^e .
The term () also generates the Yukawa interactions
since

2^b^a^c=^b(i^a^c+c.c. ).
The non-Abelian gauge kinetic term is obtained with the products

.f^abc D^G^a
D_(V^b V^c_)_^2 &=&
2f^abc (_A_^a) A_^b
A_^c(^^^^).f^abc f^ade D^(V^b 
V^c_)D_(V^b V^c_)_^2 &=&
f^abc f^ade A_^b A_^c A_^d A_^e
(^^^^),
since we have, using the properties () and
,

eq25 
&&f^abc d^2(_A_^a) A_^b A_^c
(^^^^)&=&f^abc (^A_^a) A_^b A^c +
f^abc A_^b A_^c(^A^a -^A^a ),
and

&&f^abc f^ade d^2A_^b A_^c A_^d A_^e
(^^^^)&=&2f^abc f^ade A_^b A^d A_^c A^e .
With the gauge condition , 
the first term in the right-hand side of Eq.() vanishes and only the
expected term remains.
Gathering these results, we find that the extension to an
 pure
super-Yang-Mills Lagrangian is given by

L _Y.M. &=&d^2D^G^a+gf^abc (G^bV^c 
+i 2 D^(V^b V_^c))^2&=&-1 4 F^a F_ ^a+i 2 ^aD^a
+D^^a D_^a&&-g 2 f^abc (i^b^a^c+c.c. )+D^aD^a,
where 
and .



To conclude, let us stress the central point of these results. Whereas in,
the starting point was a given dynamics (Abelian Higgs model) described by a 
on-shell Lagrangian which was then elevated to , we do not start here
with any specific dynamics but instead build directly 
off-shell Lagrangians with  superfields.
This allows us to generate different dynamics and we generalize the elevation 
to a  non-Abelian theory. Clearly, one could consider with the same method
other  dynamics.

Finally, this work might be used in the context of effective models
for high-temperature (planar) superconductivity,
where the initial  supermultiplets are built out of composites of spinons and holons in the 
spin-charge separation framework.
