Having calculated the square of the 7-particle form factors
the corresponding contributions to the spin-spin correlation function
and the spectral density can now be computed straightforwardly.
The only difficulty is that to get correct numerical results
one has to use high precision arithmetic in order to avoid
huge rounding errors in calculating .
As explained above, to put it into a manageable form, we expressed it
in terms of the basic symmetric polynomials 
.
Although it is a sum of absolute squares and thus 
it is obviously positive, it is not manifestly positive in this form.
Actually we experienced large cancellations between positive and
negative contributions. After rescaling all rapidities by  all
coefficients of the polynomial become integers and we can illustrate
the large degree of cancellation by considering the following
integer rapidities:
_1=12,_2=11,_3=10,_4=9,_5=8,_6=7,_7=0.

We can exactly calculate the sum of positive and negative
contributions in this case and we get

We have computed the 7-particle contribution to the spin-spin
correlation function using the VEGAS integration routine,
and a subroutine computing  invoking quartic precision (32 digit)
arithmetic. 
The results, compared with the prediction of two-loop perturbation theory,
are shown in Figure SPIN7bw . Note that here we have no free 
parameters
at our disposal in the perturbative calculation as would be the case
in most other models. As discussed above, we know the exact relation between
the perturbative  parameter and the particle mass  
and also the absolute normalization of the perturbative curve is
available in this model. The form factor results are in very good
agreement with perturbation theory in the expected (high) energy range.
The small deviation for energies  
can be accounted for by the contribution of  intermediate particles.
To illustrate the fact that this good agreement is quite nontrivial,
in Figure SPIN7bw  we also show the perturbative result 
with the overall factor changed arbitrarily by 5.

The 7-particle results also corroborate the scaling hypothesisBN 
for the spectral densities. To study this aspect we introduce the
modified -particle spectral density depending on the logarithmic 
variable  by the definition
^(r) ()=R^(r) (x),equation 
These are defined for all , where the cases with  even refer
to the spectral densities of the two-point function of the
isospin Noether current. 
The graph of this function is a bell-shaped curve starting as zero
at , reaching its maximum  at  and then slowly
decreasing for larger . Let us introduce the rescaled spectral
density  by  
Y^(r) (z)=1 M^(r)  R^(r) (^(r) z).

the spectral functions of two different isovector operators,

Abstract 


 
The 7-particle form factors of the fundamental spin field of the O(3) 
nonlinear -model are constructed. We calculate the corresponding
contribution to the spin-spin correlation function, and compare 
with predictions from the spectral density scaling hypothesis. 
The resulting approximation to the spin-spin correlation function 
agrees well with that computed in renormalized (asymptotically free) 
perturbation theory in the expected energy range. 
Further we observe simple lower and upper bounds for the sum of the 
absolute square of the form factors which may be of use for 
analytic estimates.

Because of the large cancellation between positive and negative terms
in the representation of  in terms of symmetric polynomials,
it is natural to ask if there exists an alternative representation
that is manifestly positive. It is indeed possible to find such
representations. If we arrange the rapidities in decreasing order
(which is always possible since the polynomial is symmetric under
permutations) then all  rapidity
differences are positive and we found (for all available
particle numbers ) that if we expand 
in terms of these differences then all coefficients are positive.
Moreover, it is possible to find upper and lower bounds both of which
are of the simple form () such that, expanded in terms of
the rapidity differences , each and every term in the expansion
of  has smaller coefficient than the corresponding one of
the upper bound  and similarly larger than the
coefficient of the corresponding term of the lower bound  
.

The value of the parameter characterizing the lower bound is
uniformly  for all cases  , whereas
the  giving the lowest upper bound are
t^(3) _u=2,t^(4) _u=9/4,t^(5) _u=2.434,t^(6) _u=2.576,t^(7) _u=2.688.
The last three values are numerically approximate 
(e.g. the exact value for the case  is ) 
and come from the requirement
that the constant term of  be larger than
that of . This is clearly necessary, but at least in the
available cases for  it is also sufficient
(The case  is an exception since
the requirement in this case yields a value ,
which is not quite sufficient.) .

The integrals over the spin and current spectral densities are 
given as sums of the integrals defined in ():
 
An outstanding question is whether these are finite or infinite in 
the FF construction. Certainly renormalized perturbation 
theory predicts that .
Also the validity of the scaling hypothesis requires this because 
in this scenario  grows as ; the numerical 
evidence thereof is shown in Figure .

If the bounds we found above for  
continue to be true for all ,
then the simple structure of () allows to study the structure
of the correlation function analytically. The existence of an upper
limit of simple form may help proving the existence of the correlation
function whereas the existence of the lower bound may facilitate the
construction of a proof that 
independent of the validity of the scaling hypothesis.



 
 
 
Numerical values of the integrals 
. Numerical errors are estimated as  on the 
last digit quoted.  



We are not going to discuss these questions further in this paper,
but to illustrate the usefulness of the existence of the simple lower bound
we have calculated the integrals . These are defined
analogously to the ones in () using 
instead of . The simplicity of the integrand allows us to
calculate these integrals numerically quite effortlessly 
(This is because one can represent 
as an integral with the integrand just involving the polynomial 
in Eq.  (instead all its permutations), at the cost of extending
the limits of integration over the  from  to .) 
up to . The results of the numerical integration are given in Table 1.

Although the integrals  are (apparently) decreasing with
, it is possible that they are decreasing slow enough to make
the series () diverge. Indeed, as seen in Figure ,
 is monotonically increasing for all  evaluated 
up to now.
