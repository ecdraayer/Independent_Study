We compute the meson spectrum of an  super
Yang-Mills theory with fundamental matter from its dual string 
theory on  with a D7-brane probe. 
For scalar and vector mesons with arbitrary R-charge the spectrum 
is computed in closed form by solving the equations for D7-brane 
fluctuations; for matter with non-zero mass  it is discrete, 
exhibits a mass gap of order  and furnishes 
representations of  even though the manifest global symmetry 
of the theory is only . The spectrum of mesons with large 
spin  is obtained from semiclassical rotating open strings attached 
to the D7-brane. It displays Regge-like behaviour for , whereas
for   it corresponds to that of two non-relativistic quarks 
bound by a Coulomb potential. Meson interactions, baryons and 'giant
gauge bosons' are briefly discussed. 




D-branes, Supersymmetry and Duality,
Brane Dynamics in Gauge Theories 

hep-th/0304032  






Introduction  
The best-understood example of the AdS/CFT correspondence 
 (see for a
review) is the duality between IIB string theory on 5 5  
and  super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, which can be
motivated by analyzing the low-energy dynamics of a stack of  
D3-branes in Minkowski space. All matter fields in 
the gauge theory are in the adjoint representation. Of course, one can
study the response of the theory to external  sources in the
fundamental representation by computing, for example, the Wilson
loop. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, this was done in 
 by studying a string with endpoints attached to the 
AdS boundary.

It was noted in that by introducing  D7-branes into
5 5 ,  flavours of dynamical  quarks (or, more precisely, 
 fundamental hypermultiplets) can be added to the gauge theory, 
breaking the supersymmetry to . 
This can be understood by starting 
with a stack of  D3-branes and  parallel D7-branes in 
Minkowski space, which we represent by the array
 
The behaviour of the modes at infinity is given by
^+_I () ^-, 
^-_I () ^-.
The conformal dimensions of the corresponding UV operators 
can be found using equation () and are  
for the mode that transforms in the ,
and  for the mode transforming in the 
.

For modes of type II we only need the equation with   
since the rest are again identically satisfied. From the equation of 
motion we find
R^4 (^2+L^2)^2  ^_A_+ 1 ^3  
_(^3 _A_) +1 ^2  
^i_i A_=0 ,

or
M ^2 (1+^2)^2  _II () + 1 ^3  
_(^3 __II ()) - 
(+2)1 ^2  _II () =0 .

The solution is now
_II () = ^(1+^2)^-  
F(+1- , - ; +2 ; -^2) ,
with spectrum
M _II ^2 = 4 (n++1)(n++2) , 
n0 , 0 ,
and boundary behaviour
_II ()^-.
The associated UV conformal dimension is .

Finally, for modes of type III, the equation with  
gives a relation
(+2)  _III () = 
1   _(^3 _III ()) .
For  this relation gives , which 
is not regular at , so we must exclude this case. When 
, using this relation, the equations corresponding 
to  and  turn out to be equivalent, so we can
write (after using ())
_( 1  _(^3 _III () ) 
) -(+2) _III () 
- M ^2^2 (1+^2)^2  _III () =0 ,
with the solution
_III () = ^(1+^2)^- 
F(-++1 , - ; +2 ; -^2) ,
spectrum
M _III ^2 = 4(n++1)(n++2) , 
n0 ,1 ,
and boundary behaviour
_III () ^-.
The conformal dimension of the associated UV operator is 
.






Analysis of the spectrum 


Summarising the previous results, the bosonic modes on the D7-brane 
give rise to the following mesonic spectrum:
 
First note that there are no massless modes, , there is a mass gap 
in the spectrum equal to the mass of the lightest meson, given
by 
m_gap  = 22  L R^2  = 22 g_sN   .
This means that in the regime , in which we are 
working, the meson mass is much smaller than the quark mass and 
so these mesons, together with the excitations of the 
 multiplet, dominate the 
physics at low energy. In perturbation theory one would find that 
, with a binding energy . 
At large 't Hooft coupling, however, we obtain that the theory is such 
that the binding energy almost cancels the rest energy of the quarks. 
This is clear from the bulk picture of meson 'formation', in which two 
strings of opposite orientation stretching from the D7-brane to the 
horizon (the quark-anti quark pair) join together to form an open
string with both ends on the D7-brane (the meson); this resulting
string is much shorter than the initial ones, and hence corresponds
to a configuration with much lower energy.

Since the theory has  supersymmetry the mesons should fill 
(massive) supermultiplets. Since the supercharges commute with 
 all states in a given supermultiplet will be in the same 
representation of . The type of multiplet of interest here 
can be generated by applying the supercharges  to a scalar state 
with spin  under  that is annihilated  by the
's. Each of these multiplets contains an equal number,
, of bosonic and fermionic states. Specifically, the
generic () multiplet consists of three real scalars and 
one vector in the  of , a two real scalars 
in the , and two Dirac fermions, one in the 
 and one in the . 
The bosonic content matches precisely the meson spectrum 
that we found, since
M_s(n,) = M_III (n,) = M_II (n,) = 
M_I ,+ (n,= M_I ,- (n,+1) ,
where, for the last two modes, we have shifted  in such a way 
that all modes transform in the same  representation of 
. If  the supermultiplet consists of 
two real scalars and one vector in the  of , one scalar 
in the , and one Dirac fermion in the . If instead 
 then there are three real scalars and one vector 
in the , one scalar in the , one Dirac fermion in the  and
another one in the . These two non-generic cases are also 
perfectly reproduced by the mode spectrum. For example, the fact 
that the type III modes exist for all  except for  
agrees with the fact that the  multiplet contains one scalar
field less than all other multiplets with .

Given the bosonic meson spectrum, supersymmetry allows us to obtain 
the fermionic spectrum as:
 
Note that the spectrum exhibits a huge degeneracy, since all states with
the same value of  have the same mass. This suggests the 
existence of an extra, hidden symmetry that we now proceed to
investigate. 

We begin by noting that the first two scalar modes and 
the vector modes (see modes ) that have the same mass, 
, transform in the (reducible) representation
(0,0) (1 2 ,1 2 ) 
( 2 , 2 )
of . Perhaps surprisingly, this is precisely the 
decomposition in  representations of the 
representation of  of highest weight 
, which corresponds to scalar spherical harmonics on .   
These are functions  that satisfy
^2_S^4  ^(S^4) = -(+3) ^(S^4) = 
- [(+1)(+2)-2] ^(S^4) ,
where  is the Laplacian on . We also see 
that the eigenvalue of the Laplacian is, up to a constant, the meson 
mass. The rest of the bosonic modes, those that we called 
types III, (I,+) and (I,-), with a given value of
, can also be assembled into a representation of  of 
highest weight(Note that for type III modes we cannot use a
   representation, since these modes only exist for 
.) 
 (which corresponds to vector spherical harmonics on ), 
since this decomposes under  as 
[,1] = _  [ (,) 

(+1 2 ,2 ) 

(2 ,+1 2 ) ] .
Note, however, that the modes in question do not have the same mass, 
since ,  and 
 only coincide if we shift the 's 
as in (). We therefore conclude that the spectrum
furnishes representations of , but that not all states in the
same irreducible representation have the same mass. This means that
 is not an exact symmetry (, it does not commute with the
Hamiltonian operator). This was to be expected, since 
an  symmetry would imply a symmetry under the interchange 
of  with , but this is not present here, 
as is manifest from the different masses of the modes  
and . 

The appearance of  and the fact that it only implies a mass
degeneracy for certain modes can be understood more
geometrically as follows. The induced metric indmetric  on 
the D7-brane is conformally equivalent to that of 
, since it can be written
as 
ds^2 = L^2 R^2  (1+^2) ds^2(g ) ,
where
ds^2(g ) = ds^2((1,3) ) 
+R^4 4L^2  [4 (1+^2)^2 
(d^2+^2 d_3^2)] .
This is the metric on , written using the
coordinate  defined in redefinition . We have factored it
in such a way that the expression in square brackets is the metric
of a unit four-sphere in stereographic coordinates.(The
  relation between  and the familiar azimuthal angle  is
  .)  
The induced worldvolume metric has this
property because the 5 5  metric AdSmetric  itself is 
conformally flat:  in terms of new coordinates 
, it takes the form
ds^2 = 1 Z ^2  [ 
ds^2((1,3) ) + dZ dZ  ] ,
and the D7-brane embedding equation, , becomes the equation 
of a four-sphere. Put yet another way, the inversion that
takes  into  transforms a four-plane into a
four-sphere. 

The conformal factor in confmet  depends on one of the
coordinates of the four-sphere, and therefore it explicitly 
breaks the  symmetry of R4S4metric  down to . 
If the theory on the D7-brane were conformally invariant then 
we could ignore the conformal factor and conclude that the theory
possesses an exact  symmetry. Of course, 
the D7-brane theory is not conformally invariant,
but for some modes the effect of the conformal factor on the 
quadratic  part of the action can be compensated by a field
redefinition, which explains the  mass degeneracy of the
corresponding sector of the free  spectrum. Let us illustrate 
this for the first two scalar modes in modes . 

Starting again from the Lagrangian lag  but now using 
the form () of the induced metric we obtain
-_7L^4(2)^2 2R^4 (1+^2)^2g  
g ^ab  _a_b , 
where  denotes the determinant of the 
 metric  R4S4metric . We 
only write one of the scalars explicitly, since the (quadratic) Lagrangian 
for the other, , is exactly the same. As expected, the 
factor  seems to break the  symmetry but, 
if we define a new field as
  = (1+^2)  ,
we can rewrite the Lagrangian as
-_7L^4(2)^2 2R^4 g   
[g ^ab  _a  _b 
+ 2L^2 R^4 (2^2 ^2
-(1+^2)_( ^2))] .The first term is manifestly invariant under  but the others are 
not. Surprisingly, however, if we integrate the final term by parts (within 
the action), we find that all of the -dependence of the square 
bracket can be extracted into the prefactor , and the 
Lagrangian simplifies to
-_7L^4(2)^2 R^4 g  
(1 2 g ^ab  _a _b 
+4L^2 R^4  ^2) ,which is manifestly -invariant, as claimed. Furthermore, by
expanding  in scalar spherical harmonics 
and integrating over the , we obtain a non-interacting, 
(3+1)-dimensional effective Lagrangian that consists of a sum of
individual quadratic Lagrangians, one for each mode. Up to
numerical pre-factors, the Lagrangian for the -th mode takes 
the form
- _7 R^4 (2)^2 
(_ ^ 
+ 4L^2 R^4 [(+3)+2] ^2). 
We thus see that the mass of the -th scalar is 
, as before. Furthermore, as
suggested by the fact that equation meor  has Legendre 
function solutions, the wavefunctions agree, after a change of 
variables, with those found earlier in () and 
(). In particular, the hypergeometric functions 
of equation salaam  combine with the 's of equation
wavefunk  to produce the 's. 

An analogous calculation can be done for the vector mesons
with the same result, namely that the quadratic 
Lagrangian can be rewritten in a manifestly -invariant way, 
but this is not possible for the rest of the modes. 
This explains the mass degeneracy of the scalar and vector modes noted
above, and the absence of such a degeneracy in the rest of the spectrum. 
Let us again stress that this partial degeneracy is a feature of the free 
spectrum, since it follows from certain properties of the quadratic 
D7-brane action. 

Although  is not an true symmetry, the fact that the spectrum 
furnishes representations of  does have a predictive 
power, since it implies that, once a 
certain meson is present in the spectrum, all other mesons necessary 
to build the corresponding  representation must also be 
present (albeit not necessarily with the same mass). The regularity of 
the spectrum suggests that one should be able to take this issue 
further and uncover other 'symmetries' of the spectrum, including 
perhaps a spectrum-generating algebra. We leave further investigation 
of this interesting subject for the future. 

We wish to close this section by noting that the unexpected appearance
of  discussed here will presumably have an analogue for 
other D-branes in AdS: an inversion will map the directions parallel to 
the D-brane and orthogonal to the D3-branes into a sphere. This 
could have interesting applications in the context of the AdS/dCFT 
correspondence. 


Meson interactions 


The discussions in the previous subsections amount to an
analysis of the non-interacting sector of the effective 
meson field theory. Here we wish to comment briefly on their 
interactions, gained by expanding the D7-brane action 
() to higher order in the scalar and vector fields. 
This (3+1)-dimensional theory is simply the KK reduction of 
the worldvolume theory over the  and along the radial 
direction.

The simplest scalar interaction to consider is cubic in the fields and
is contained in the Lagrangian already written in equation lag 
(using the metric indmetric ):
- _7 -g_ab  
(1+2(R)^2 g^cd  r^2 
(_c _d + _c _d )) . 
In the above, we truncated this to quadratic order by neglecting the
field-dependence of the factor . If, instead, we expand it
to first order in the fields, the terms of interest are
&& -_7 (2)^2 ^3g  
(R^4 2(^2+L^2)^2  (_^+
 _^) + 1 2 (_)^2 + 
1 2 (_)^2.

& &.+
1 2^2 g ^ij (_i_j+ _i_j)
-4R^4L (^2+L^2)^3 
(_^+ _^)) , 
recalling that  is the metric on the unit three-sphere.
The classical equations of motion can be applied to remove the
radial and angular derivatives, by integrating by parts in the action.
To do so, we first decompose each field in terms of its four-dimensional
spectrum, as follows:
 _n_a _a () L^_a   
^_a (S^3) h_a(x^) ,
 _n_b _b () L^_a   
^_b (S^3) f_a(x^) ,
where the sum over  runs over all values of ,  and the
other quantum numbers implicit on .
The radial and angular factors each satisfy their respective equations
of motion, meor  and seer . 
Since the radial parts, given in salaam , have been 
written in terms of the dimensionless coordinate , we have 
extracted their dimensionful content in the factors ,
where . The 's and 's are then the KK 
towers of mesonic fields in whose interactions we are interested.

In performing the KK reduction, the integrals over  and  will 
produce dimensionless functions of the four quantum numbers
that specify each KK mode. 
After substituting the field decompositions decomp  into the Lagrangian,
each quadratic term will contain a product of two radial and two angular
factors. Their orthogonality properties result in the 
corresponding integrals being proportional to  and 
, respectively. Their product therefore provides a factor 
proportional to  that we shall denote by  (no sum). 
Conversely, each term in the cubic Lagrangian will contain a product of three 
radial and three angular factors and, in general, no such simplication of the 
corresponding integrals is possible. Hence, we will denote them by .

With these considerations, after applying the equations of motion, the 
Lagrangian is written
&=&_7 R^4 (2)^2 _a  1 L^2_a  _a
(-1 2 (_h_a ^h_a
+_f_a ^f_a) - 1 2 M^2_a(h^2_a + f^2_a))

& & +_7 R^4 (2)^3 2 L 
_a, b, c  1 L^_a+_b+_c   _abc 
f_a(_h_b ^h_c + _f_b ^f_c) .
The mass parameters appearing in this expression depend on the 's 
and 's through equation spectrum . We are now in a position to 
normalize the fields so as to leave the quadratic Lagrangian in canonical form, 
in order to arrive at an expression that we can interpret as a 
(3+1)-dimensional effective theory of the mesons. Noting that
, the required field redefinitions are
clearly



















































h _a=1 2^2 L^_a  
N _a 2    h_a , and a similar expression for . Comparison with decomp 
shows that the 's and 's have the same dimensions as 
 and , namely (length), appropriate to scalar fields in 
four dimensions. If we then substitute these new fields into the cubic
part of the Lagrangian blag :
^(3) =(2)^32 N   L  _a, b, c 
_abc _abc  _a _b _c  
f _a(_h _b ^h _c 
+ _f _b^f _c) ,
we can read off the dimensionful cubic coupling strength as

















g_()^2  1 N  
 L 1 N   1  
 , using  to denote a generic scalar. A similar calculation using the 
expansion of the Lagrangian to fourth order reveals
g_^4  1  1 N  , g_^2()^2  1 N 1 ^2  , and  
g_()^4   N 1 ^4 
for the quartic couplings, where  is the 't Hooft 
coupling. Note that, from the field theory viewpoint, the dependence 
on the quark mass  follows from dimensional analysis and the 
dependence on  agrees with a large- argument. 
The dependence on the 't Hooft coupling is a prediction of our 
calculations in AdS.

Now we turn to the vector mesons. They correspond to the 
type II  components of the eight-component worldvolume 
vector. To find the couplings of their self-interactions one may 
expand the action in equation daction  to higher order to produce
terms of the form . Alternatively, 
as we will do, one may consider the case of a non-Abelian worldvolume theory,
where standard gauge interactions would appear at leading order. 
The leading gauge term of the Born-Infeld Lagrangian is 
proportional to , and




contains the quadratic and leading (in an  expansion) 
cubic and quartic interactions, since the non-Abelian field 
strength contains commutators of the gauge fields: 
. Considering terms
involving the vector mesons only, the relevant Lagrangian is
&=&-_7 (2)^2 4 ^3g  (
R^4 (^2+L^2)^2  F _ F ^ 
+2  _A__A^
+ 2 ^2 g ^ij   _i A__j A^

& &+R^4 (^2+L^2)^2 (2i  F _ [A^,A^]
 - [A_, A_][A_, A_])) , where .

The gauge fields take values in the adjoint representation of the gauge 
group, , and can be decomposed, in terms of its  
generators, as . The functional 
coefficients  each take the same form typeII  as the 
Abelian type II fields discussed earlier and can therefore be decomposed, 
in turn, as was done for the scalar fields in decomp . In what follows 
it will not be necessary write the  fields in terms of their generators, 
so we use the decomposition
A_ _n_a _a () L^_a  
^_a (S^3)W_a   , where  satisfies the equation of
motion martin , and we have introduced an effective four-dimensional
vector field  for each mode of . 

We can now substitute vecomp  into vlad  and perform the KK 
reduction. The resulting integrals in the quadratic part of vlad  will be 
identical to those in blag , but those in the cubic and quartic parts will 
not. In a similar notation to that used above, we denote them by 
 and . Then, after applying the
classical equations of motion, vlad  becomes























&=&_7 R^4 (2)^2 (
_a 1 L^2_a  _a (-1 4  G_a   G_a^ 
-1 2  M_a^2  W_a   W_a^ )

& &+i 2  _abc  1 L^_a+_b+_c   _abc 
  G_a  [W_b^, W_c^]

& &-1 4 _abcd  1 L^_a+_b+_c+_d   _abcd 
  [W_a  , W_b  ][W_c^, W_d^]) , using . By comparison with 
blag  one can see that the field redefinition required to put drac  in 
standard form is exactly the same as that required for the scalars, redef . 
By counting fields, it is then clear that after making the redefinitions the dimensionful 
couplings of the cubic and quartic interactions are










g_W^2(W)  1 N   , 
and  g_W^4  1 N  , respectively, with no dependence on the quark mass or the 't Hooft coupling. 
This again matches the large- expectations.






Field/operator correspondence 


As discussed before, close to the boundary the D7-brane is embedded 
as an  subspace and the theory is conformal in the 
large- limit. The asymptotic behaviour of the modes determines the 
conformal dimension of the lowest-dimension operator that, in the 
conformal theory, has the same quantum numbers as the meson.
From the previous results we have seen that the conformal dimensions 
are:  for the scalar and vector modes 
transforming in the  and coming from ,  and 
;  for the scalar mode transforming in the 
; and  for the scalar 
mode transforming in the . This is in 
precise agreement with what was described at the beginning of this 
section. In particular, notice that what we call here  and  
comprise the 5  vector which we previously called , while 
the modes transforming as  and 
 were denoted by 
 and , respectively. This gives a 
check on the large- behaviour of the modes we found. 
 
Furthermore, we can find the operators in the conformal field theory 
that are dual to these modes. First, all operators dual to D7-brane 
modes must contain at least two hypermultiplet fields. Moreover, it is 
easy to see that they must contain exactly  two of these fields 
if they correspond to single-particle states. With this in mind, the 
chiral primary operators dual to the modes  are uniquely 
determined by symmetry. Indeed, these modes transform in the 
 representation. The dual operators must have the same 
quantum numbers, , they must be invariant under 
 and transform as a triplet under ; 
in addition they must have conformal dimension . It is easy 
to see that the unique possibility for the dual of  is the 
-triplet of operators 
^I =  ^m ^I_mn  ^n ,
where  and  are the Pauli matrices. A set of 
analogous operators was also found in, in the context 
of a D5-brane in 5 5 , to be the chiral primaries dual to the 
lowest-angular momentum modes on the brane.

As usual in AdS/CFT, we expect the higher- chiral primaries, 
, dual to  to be constructed as follows. 
Consider the multiplet of operators 
_= Y^(i_1  Y^i_ ) 
where  and the parentheses stand for traceless 
symmetrization of the indices. This set of operators transforms under 
 in the  representation, which 
can be composed with the  to obtain the 
representation. We therefore expect that the operator of dimension 
, dual to the  fields, takes the form
_=  ^m _mn   _ ^n ,
with the  indices implicit in  and  
appropriately composed to obtain the  representation. 

The operators in each chiral multiplet dual to the rest of D7-brane
modes can be obtained from the chiral primaries described above by
acting on the latter with the appropriate combinations of
supercharges. 

For large but finite , the operators  are only 
independent for . In the last section we discuss 
how this truncation may be reproduced on the AdS side.












Meson spectrum (large spin, no R-charge) 

We now turn to the spectrum of mesons with four-dimensional spin .
As mentioned in the Introduction, an exact calculation would require
quantizing open strings attached to the D7-brane, which is not
feasible because of the non-trivial background. However, for large 
the spectrum can be obtained from classical, rotating open strings.
In order to minimize the energy, the string end points will be
attached to the D7-brane at the minimum possible value of 
(from the 5  viewpoint), that is, at .

We expect two different limiting regimes to appear depending on how
the proper size  of the string compares to the AdS radius
. If  then the curvature of AdS
is irrelevant and hence the spectrum should be that found in flat space,
, we should find . Since in flat space
, this regime should occur when
. If instead , then the AdS curvature
becomes important and the spectrum is drastically modified; we will see
that it agrees with that of two non-relativistic quarks weakly bound by
a Coulomb potential.

To study a rotating string we will work with the Nambu-Goto form of the
action:
S =  L(X,X',X ) =
- 1 2   
(X X')^2-X ^2 X'^2  .
Here  and  parametrize the string worldsheet ,
 specify its embedding in spacetime, the dots
and the primes denote differentiation with respect to  and
, respectively, and the scalar products are taken with respect to the
5 5  metric. The string configurations we are seeking lie at a
point on  and within a two-plane in , 
so the relevant part of the spacetime metric is
ds^2 = R^2 z^2  (
-dt^2 + d^2 + ^2 d^2 + dz^2 ) .
The coordinate  is related to the coordinate  in
equation AdSmetric 
by , so the AdS boundary is at . The D7-brane extends
from the boundary  to a maximum value . As
mentioned before, fixing  amounts to fixing the unique scale
 in the gauge theory. Recall that the mass of the dynamical quarks
is .

We fix the time reparametrization invariance of the string worldsheet
by identifying . In addition we set 
for constant , which means that the string rotates in the
-plane and hence carries a non-zero spin. Under these
circumstances the string action becomes
S = - R^2 2  
1 z^2  (1- ^2 ^2 )
( ^2 + z' ^2 )  ,
where  and  specify the time-independent
string profile.(The action truncated  is consistent in
  the sense that any solution of its equations of motion 
  automatically provides a solution of those of NGaction .)  
In order to eliminate the dependence of the equations
of motion on , it is convenient to work with the rescaled,
dimensionless coordinates
= z ,
in terms of which the action becomes
S = - R^2  2  
1 ^2  (1- ^2 )
( ^2 + ^2 )  .
Similarly, the energy and the spin are
E &=& L   - L =
R^2  2  
1 ^2  ^2 + ^2 1- ^2   ,
 

J &=& L   =
R^2 2  
^2 ^2  ^2 + ^2 1- ^2   .
Note that the condition that the string endpoints are attached to the
D7-brane at  translates into the Dirichlet boundary
condition .

Two convenient choices to fix the worldspace reparametrization
invariance of the string are:  and .
In the first case we are left with an equation of motion for :
1++ 2   -
1-^2  = 0 ,
whereas in the second case we have an equation for :
1+- 2   +
 1-^2  = 0 .
As we will see, each choice breaks down at a discrete number of points
along the string.

As is well-known, the equations of motion for an open string must be
supplemented with the boundary conditions
. L (X')^M  X^M 
_  =0
that ensure that the action is stationary. Since
 and  is
arbitrary (due to the Neumann boundary condition), we must impose
, that is,
. ' ^2 
1-^2 + _  =0 .
It follows that either , which means that the
string ends orthogonally on the D7-brane, or ,
which means that the endpoints of the string move at the speed of
light.(The same result is obtained by using the Polyakov action
and imposing the constraints.)  The second condition cannot correspond
to a bound state of two hypermultiplet quarks because it cannot describe
a string with both endpoints on the D7-brane. Indeed, by expanding
 for , substituting it into eqom1 
and applying this boundary condition, we find
z_D7  - 2 3z_D7   (1-)^2 +
 .
This means that  has a maximum at . 
From equation eqom1  we see that if  then ,
that
is,  can have no minima but only maxima, and therefore it
can
have only one maximum. It follows that if we start at one endpoint of
the
string with the boundary conditions  and

then the string profile  decreases monotonically
as  decreases away from , and therefore the other
string endpoint cannot be attached to the D7-brane at the same value
. It is possible, however, that a string with
these boundary conditions can extend from the D7-brane to the AdS
boundary
at .

We conclude that the appropriate boundary condition for our purposes
is that the string ends orthogonally on the D7-brane, , that
; note for later use that in the gauge
 this corresponds to .
The speed of the endpoints of the string is
determined by the actual solution and in general
is subluminal. This is easily understood by approximating
a small region around either endpoint by flat space. In this case it is
clearly possible to get a  solution with an arbitrary velocity, ,
by boosting the solution in which a static string ends on a D-brane.

To obtain the spectrum  we must solve for the string profile in
the -plane and substitute it into equations Energy  and
Spin ; this determines  and , and hence
the spectrum in parametric form. Equation eqom1 
can be integrated numerically for arbitrary  by
starting at a point ,  with the boundary
condition ; this is motivated by the expectation that the
solution must be symmetric around  and hence that the only
maximum of  must be at . To allow for the fact that
the string may double-back across  we will allow  to take
positive and negative values. The numerical integration then results in
a profile for half of the string, the other half being its mirror image.
The motion of the string is then due to the revolution of the full
profile around the point , with angular velocity . 
The results are perhaps surprising: for each value of  there 
is an infinite number of solutions distinguished by the number of nodes
, or points at which the string intersects itself
(see Figure ). Remarkably, all of these
solutions can be continued past the position of the D7-brane (at which
 and ) to the AdS boundary at .
The extended solutions obtained in this way compute Wilson loops
corresponding to two quarks of infinite mass moving around each other
with angular velocity .


file=largew.ps, height=10cm  
Solution for large angular velocity, or equivalently for
  . For illustrative purposes we have set . The
  thick solid line corresponds to a solution with no
  nodes, attached to a D7-brane represented by the thin solid line. 
  The physical size of the string is very small compared to the AdS 
  radius (as is apparent from its coordinate size in the 'physical
  coordinates'  and ), and the solution is well
  approximated by a straight string at , as would be
  the case in flat space. The continuation of the nodeless solution along
  the dashed line provides solutions with , 2, 3 or 4 nodes,
  depending on which maximum of  the corresponding
  D7-brane (not shown in the figure) is placed at. The continuation
  beyond the last maximum that terminates at the AdS boundary
  is dual to a Wilson loop corresponding to two infintely-heavy
  external quarks orbiting around each other with angular velocity
  .  
 

A brief check of the numerical results is that they exhibit the
following behaviour, in agreement with the equations of motion
eqom1  and eqom2 . First,  has a unique maximum
at . Second, at all inflexion points, at which , we
have that . Third, if  then
, that is,   has only maxima for
 and only minima for . Finally, there is one exception
to this last behaviour, occuring at . There one finds that
 but that , meaning that
 is a local minimum and  is a local maximum.
Each of these observations can be verified from Figure .

As explained in the Introduction, the projection on the AdS
boundary of these solutions suggests a structure of the 
corresponding dual meson in which the two quarks are surrounded by 
concentrical shells of gluons associated to each of the pieces of 
string between two successive nodes. The deeper the nodes are in AdS
space the larger the radius of the shell should be.

The most stable solutions are presumably those without nodes, since
those with nodes can break at the self-intersection points,
corresponding to the decay of an excited meson via the emission of a
gluon shell. We will concentrate on the  solutions in what
follows. The numerical results
for the spectrum are displayed in Figure . Analytical
results can be obtained in the two limiting regimes  and
, which, as we shall see, correspond to
 and , respectively.






Large angular velocity, or  


Let us start with the case . One can see from
the nodeless solution in Figure  that 
, in which case the second term in eqom1 
may be negligible. If we strictly ignore it then the only solution
satisfying the appropriate boundary conditions is a constant solution
, which is precisely what one would expect
in
the flat space limit, and is a suggestion that 
corresponds to the  case.
Note that since , after rescaling back we have
, namely a very short string
insensitive to the AdS curvature. Corrections to this solution
come from considering the  term in eqom1  and so are
of order . Substituting the ansatz
= z_D7  + 1 z_D7  
f()into eqom1  and keeping terms of order  we get
an equation for ,
f" + 2 -  f' 1-^2  = 0 ,
that must be supplemented with the boundary conditions
. This is solved by elementary methods, with
the result
f() = 1 2  ( ^2 + ^2 () ) .
The coordinate  has a maximum value , where the
string connects to the D7-brane. This point is determined by the
condition . Since
= 1 z_D7   ( +
() 1-^2   ) ,
we then have , which means that the endpoints of the 
string move at the speed of light. This is a result of the
approximation used here; recall, however, that they must move at 
subluminal speed in the exact solution, a fact confirmed by the 
numerical analysis. By substituting the solution
(, ) into equations Energy  and Spin 
we obtain the energy and the spin to leading order 
in :
E R^2 2 z_D7 ^2  J R^2 4 ^2 z_D7 ^2  .
Note that since  we have , as anticipated.
Eliminating  and writing  in terms of  or,
equivalently, , we find
E R z_D7   J    =
L R J   =
2 ^3/4  (g_s N)^1/4   J  .
We conclude that for  the meson masses follow a Regge
trajectory with an effective tension
_eff.  = 1 2_eff.   = E^2 2J 
= ^2  g_sN   =
1 2  R^2 z_D7 ^2  .
As the last expression shows, this tension can be simply understood as
a proper tension  at , which is then
red-shifted
as seen by a boundary observer.





Small angular velocity, or  



file=smallw.ps, height=10cm  
Solution for small angular velocity (). Again, the
dashed line represents the continuation of the solution beyond the
D7-brane. Note that although in coordinates  the string
is small it actually is very large in the physical coordinates
. 
 

We now turn to the case . Since the string is
now attached to the D7-brane very close to the AdS boundary
(in the  coordinate) and rotates very slowly, we expect it to be
well approximated by the solution  for  that 
determines the static potential between two quarks. This static
solution is well-known, and in our coordinates 
takes the form
_st. () = _ ^_0  x 
x^2 _0^4-x^4   .
Note that the factors of  implicit in the tilded coordinates
cancel from this expression, so it is valid in the  limit.
To compute the first correction we set 

and substitute this into eqom2  to obtain
-2   ( 1+3_st. '^2)
= - _st.  
1+_st. '^2 1-_st. ^2  ,
where we have made use of the fact that  satisfies
equation eqom2  without the third term. The boundary conditions for
 are .

The solution is easily found to be
() = - __0 ^  x 
Q()-Q(x) Q'(x)   _st. (x) 
1+st. (x) 1-^2_st. (x)  ,
where the function
Q()  ^  x 
x^2 (_0^4-x^4)^3/2  
has an expression (that we will not need) in terms of elliptic
functions.

The relationship between ,  and 
is determined by the  condition that the string ends orthogonally
on the D7-brane, that is,
z_D7 )=_st. '(z_D7 ) +
z_D7  ) =0 . This implies that
_z_D7  ^_0  x  _0^4-x^4  x^2 
_st. (x) 1-_st. ^2(x) 
= 1-^4 z_D7 ^4 _0^4  .We know from that 
, where 
_1 ^  y y^2 y^4-1   =
2  ^3/2  (1/4)^2  0.599 
and we have argued that in the  limit this should receive
a small correction,
which is such that 
(see, , Figure ). To leading order in , as
, we can then use 
 and neglect  in 
equation intractable . Then, further assuming that 
, we obtain
1 _0^2 _st. (0) _z_D7  ^_0 
 x x^2  _0^3 z_D7  
_0^3 z_D7   .
Note from this that  as , which
makes the approximation self-consistent. The energy and angular momentum
can be computed within the same approximation, , to leading order in
, as follows. Using the parametrization , the
string's energy is written as, c.f.  equation Energy ,
E=R^2   _z_D7  ^_0   ^2  
1+1-^2   R^2   (1+^2_0^2 2 )
_z_D7  ^_0   ^2  
1+st.  
(1+st. 1+st.  
)
using . The first term
in the integral can be split up as
& &(1 z_D7  -1 _0 )
+_z_D7  ^_0  
(1+st.   ^2 -1 ^2 )


& &1 z_D7  
+1 _0 (_0^1 y  [1 y^21-y^4  -
1 y^2 ] -1)

& &1 z_D7  - _0  ,
meaning that
E& &R^2  
(1+^2_0^2 2 )
[(1 z_D7  - _0 )
+ _z_D7  ^_0   ^2  
st. 1+st.   ]


&=&R^2 z_D7  [1-^2
_0^2 2 +(_0^4)] ,
where the integral we have not evaluated explicitly contributes a
subdominant  term. This expression gives the energy
to leading order in . From equation Spin , we can then write
JE^2_st. (0)  =R^2 _0 +(_0)
for the spin. By eliminating  and restoring , we finally
arrive at
E = 2 - E_b ,
where
E_b = m_q ^4 4 J^2  
^4 = 16 ^4 g_s N   .
It is remarkable that the binding energy  coincides
exactly with that of a classical system consisting of two 
non-relativistic particles of equal masses  bound by a 
Coulomb potential , the strength of which,
, is precisely that of the static quark-anti 
quark potential (for large ) given by the 'hanging string' 
calculation of next section.

file=EvsJ.ps, height=9cm  
Meson spectrum  obtained numerically. The horizontal
  line represents the rest mass of the quark-anti quark pair. The
  other dashed straight line is a plot of the Regge behaviour
  regge  exhibited by the spectrum for . Finally, the
  curved dashed line is a plot of  as given
  by equations ElargeJ  and kappa , which represents the energy
  of two non-relativistic quarks bound by a Coulomb potential and
  describes well the spectrum in the limit . 
 
Actually, one can see that the dependence of ,  and the radius
of the orbit also agree with the classical result. For example, the
radius
of the orbit is ,
or in terms of the rescaled radius: .
The relation  derived in equation ()
gives , namely Kepler's law, that the cube of
the radius is proportional to the square of the period of
the orbit. Note also that in the classical orbit calculation, a
non-relativistic treatment is justified, since the speed  of 
the quarks, as follows from identifying , is 
.

We would like to emphasize that this agreement is a consequence of a highly
non-trivial modification of the open string spectrum on the D7-brane
in 5  for large . This means that a string in AdS space can not
only describe the statics of a Coulomb potential  but
also the dynamics of masses bound by it. It is interesting to see
that, in the string calculation, the mass of the quarks, their kinetic energy
and the Coulomb energy all come from the energy of the string.

To summarize, from the viewpoint of the boundary theory our results
imply that the meson mass, as a function of , follows a Regge trajectory
for small , whereas for large  it is well explained by particles
moving in a Coulomb potential. In the language of QCD, one could say
that for small  the quarks behave as light quarks since they are
ultra-relativistic, whereas for  large they behave as heavy quarks, 
, non-relativistically. However, one should not take the 
analogy with QCD much further because the potential 
at large distances in our case is not confining, but Coulombic.











Quark-anti quark potential 

In this section we will compute the static  potential
between a dynamical quark-anti quark pair and we will verify
that the result is in precise agreement with the dynamical ,
rotating-string calculation above. Since we closely follow
the calculation in reference, performed in Euclidean
signature, we write the relevant part of the 5  metric as
ds^2 = [ U^2 ^2  ( dt^2 + d^2 ) +
^2 U^2  dU^2 ] .
The coordinate  has dimensions of (length) and is
related to the radial coordinate  of equation AdSmetric  by
, while . The
D7-brane sits at .

We consider a string whose embedding is specified as
 and whose endpoints lie on the D7-brane at a
distance  from one another. Without loss of generality,
we can picture the string as straddling the point ,
about which the embedding profile is symmetric. Then, choosing
a parametrization , the string action per unit time, namely
its energy, takes the form
E = 1   _0^_0   U'^2 + U^4/^4  ,
where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to .
That the Lagrangian is independent of  implies
U^4 U'^2 +U^4/^4   = ^2 U_0^2 ,
where  is the minimum value of  and is
determined by the condition
_0 = ^2 U_0  _1^2m_q/U_0 
y y^2 y^4-1   .
Therefore, using equation constant , the energy nrg  of
the quark-anti quark pair is given by
E= U_0   _1^2m_q/U_0  y
y^2 y^4 -1   .
We will now see that the two limiting cases of large and small
angular momentum discussed above correspond to the quantity
 being large and small, respectively - , to
large and small separation between the quarks, as compared
to the scale set by the lightest meson.




Large separation 


Let us think of keeping  fixed and making 
large. We shall see below that this corresponds to the desired,
large- regime. Then we can rewrite u0  as
_0 = ^2 U_0   -
^2 U_0  _2m_q/U_0 ^ 
y  1 y^2 y^4-1   ,
where  was defined in c , and approximate the 
integrand in integrand  by  to obtain
_0 ^2 U_0   -
^2 U_0^2 3 (2m_q)^3  .
Solving iteratively for , we find
U_0 ^2 _0 
(1- ^2 ^6 3 (2_0 m_q )^3 
) .
Now, using the leading term of this expression, we find that
m_q U_0 m_q_0 ^2 
_0 m_gap  ,
recalling that . Therefore, in
the  limit, our approximation of the 
above integral is valid. To compute the energy we first rewrite 
equation energy  as
E = 2 m_q + U_0   [
_1^y  ( y^2 y^4 -1   -1 )
- 1 ] - U_0   _2m_q/U_0 ^y 
(y^2 y^4 -1   -1 ) .
The quantity in square brackets is equal to . Approximating
the integrand in the last term by , with the same justification
as above, and using equation u0large , we arrive at
E 2 m_q - ^2 2 _0  (
1 - 1 6  ^2 ^6 (2_0 m_q)^3  ),
where the constant  (defined in kappa ) that 
controls the strength of the dominant, Coulomb-like term in the
potential, is exactly the same as that found in 
.(Since the calculation in this reference
  was done for external, infinitely heavy quarks, the rest mass 
  of the quark-anti quark pair was subtracted in order to regularize
  the result.)  
As expected, it is also the strength of the Coulomb potential found 
to bind the slowly-spinning quark-anti quark pair of the previous 
section. Note that, for fixed 't Hooft coupling and sufficiently large
distances, corrections to the Coulomb-like term are suppressed by a 
cubic power of . From the field theory viewpoint
this can be understood as the fact that, for distances  
much larger than the scale  set by the lightest meson, 
interactions are essentially due only to the exchange of the 
massless  multiplet, which must give rise to a Coulomb
potential.





Small separation 


Let us now think of keeping  fixed while decreasing .
We see from equation u0  that  from below as
. In this limit we can set ,with
, and approximate equation u0  as
_0 ^2 U_0  _0^2/U_0 -1 
z 1 4z   =
^2 U_0  2m_q U_0  -1  .
Similarly, the expression for the energy, equation energy , becomes
EU_0  2 U_0 -1  .
Following our previous strategy, we can solve iteratively for 
from equation first  to obtain
U_0 2(1-(2_0)^2 ^4 ) ,
and substitute this into the energy energy  to find 
E4_0^2 ^2 = (2 _0) _eff.  .
Therefore, for small quark-anti quark separation, , 
there is a string-like (linear) potential with an effective tension 
, precisely the same as that 
found to determine the energy of the rapidly-rotating string discussed 
in the previous section (see equation eff ). The next-to-leading 
term in the energy is suppressed by a factor of 
 with respect to the leading term above.










Baryons 

The  SYM theory does not contain matter in the
fundamental representation, so there are no dynamical baryons. There
is, however, a baryon vertex, that is, a gauge-invariant antisymmetric
combination of  external charges. In the dual string theory
description this is represented by a D5-brane wrapped on the
five-sphere at some AdS radius  and connected to the AdS boundary 
by  fundamental strings. The energy of this system
is infinite because of the infinite length of the strings 
.
Each string defines a 'direction' in 5 5 . 
If all strings are oriented in the same direction, 
then this configuration preserves half of the sixteen background 
Poincare supersymmetries, regardless of the common string 
direction and of the radial position  of the D5-brane 
.(There are also
  sixteen special conformal supersymmetries in the 5 5 
  background that we will disregard in this discussion because they
  are all broken by the D5-brane.) 
This is consistent with the conformal invariance of the gauge theory, 
which implies that there cannot be any preferred size for the baryon
vertex. 

Consider introducing the D7-brane. In the gauge theory we now have
 supersymmetry and fundamental quarks, so we expect
dynamical, finite-energy supersymmetric baryons to exist. It is not 
hard to see what the dual of such an object must be - a D5-brane 
wrapped on the five-sphere and connected by  fundamental strings to 
the D7-brane. One can imagine constructing it as follows. Start with 
an infinitely heavy baryon, , with a D5-brane connected 
by  strings to the AdS boundary. If the strings are oriented in
such a way that they intersect the D7-brane then they can each break
into two pieces, one connecting the D5- to the D7-brane and one
connecting the D7-brane to the AdS boundary. These second pieces can
then be 'moved away' leaving behind the dynamical baryon. 
This corresponds to a 
process in the gauge theory in which, for example, a bound state of  
infinitely heavy quarks  splits into a bound state of  dynamical quarks 
 and  infinitely heavy mesonic  bound states (dual to the 
string pieces from the D7-brane to the AdS boundary). 

Thinking of constructing the dynamical baryon from the baryon vertex
in this way seems to imply that it can lie at an arbitrary radial 
position in AdS because the initial baryon vertex certainly can. This
contradicts the field theory expectation that there should be a
preferred size for the dynamical baryon now that a mass scale 
has been introduced. Presumably the resolution lies in the fact that
the construction above ignores the precise way in which the
strings are attached to the D7-brane. 
Once this is taken into account, the radial position of the 
D5-brane should no longer be a free parameter. 
This would be analogous to the fact that the size of a
monopole realized as a spike connecting two parallel D3-branes 
is related to the distance between the branes. In fact, one can 
think of realizing the baryon itself as an BIon-like 
excitation of the D7-brane: one can imagine a spike, representing 
the  strings, that emanates from the D7-brane and that subsequently 
closes upon itself forming the (hemi)spherical D5-brane. 
The strings and the D5-brane would in this
way be constructed 'out of the fields on the D7-brane', being
associated to scalar excitations, as well as to local non-zero electric 
(for the strings) and magnetic (for the D5-brane) fluxes 
of the gauge field on the D7-brane. Since the D7-brane fields
are in turn associated to meson states in the gauge theory, this
picture would provide the string realization of the baryon as a bound state
of mesons, as in the skyrme model. 
One reason that makes an explicit construction of the relevant 
solution of the D7-brane worldvolume theory difficult is that
the spike should interpolate between a D7 and a D5-brane, so its
topology will be complicated.

The fact that the dynamical baryon is supersymmetric is not completely
obvious because one may worry that the supersymmetry preserved by
the spherical D5-brane might be incompatible with that preserved by
the D7-brane. A simple way to see that this is not the case is to
recall why supersymmetry is preserved by the infinitely 
heavy baryon vertex. Each of the three elements in 
this system, namely, the D3-branes creating the AdS background, 
the spherical D5-brane and the  parallel strings, imposes a 
projection on the preserved supercharges that, acting individually, 
halves their number. However, only two of these projections are
independent, hence eight supercharges (as opposed to only four) are
preserved. Since we may choose the two independent projections to be
those associated with the D3-branes and to the strings, it is clear that 
the introduction of the D7-brane will just halve again the total 
amount of supersymmetry, as long as it is parallel to the D3-branes and
orthogonal to the strings. We thus conclude that the dynamical baryon
vertex preserves one-half of the supersymmetry of the  gauge
theory. 







Discussion 


Introducing a finite number of D7-brane probes in 5 5  is dual 
to introducing a finite numbers of flavours (, hypermultiplets in
the fundamental representation of the gauge group) in the 
SYM theory. The resulting system enjoys 
supersymmetry. 

In this paper we have used the bulk side of this AdS/CFT
correspondence with flavour to analyze in detail the spectrum of 
field theory mesons. These are quark/anti-quark bound states, which
come in supersymmetry multiplets and hence can be bosonic or
fermionic. Their bulk duals are open strings with both ends on 
the D7-brane. The strength of their interactions is given by the 
open-string coupling constant, which scales as 
 for large  (with  fixed). 
Closed-string interactions scale as , as corresponds 
to glueball interactions in the large- gauge theory. 
The string picture thus provides a particularly simple understanding
of large- field theory scalings.

To compute the meson spectrum one should quantize these open
strings. Since that is not possible at the moment we have resorted to 
a field theory approximation (, to using the D7-brane DBI action) for
mesons with R-charge, which are dual to D7-brane massless modes with
angular momentum on the five-sphere. For mesons with (large)
four-dimensional spin, which are dual to highly-excited rotating
strings, we have used a semiclassical approximation. 

In the first case we obtained the spectrum by solving the equations 
of motion obtained from the quadratic approximation to the DBI action. 
This calculation is similar to what was done in the literature for 
glueball masses in the supergravity duals of confining theories
. 
However, here we have solved the equations analytically in 
terms of hypergeometric functions and have obtained the spectrum 
in closed form. It possesses a mass gap of order , 
which shows that the mesons are much lighter than the quarks
in the large-'t Hooft coupling limit. Therefore, together with the 
 vector multiplet, they dominate the low-energy dynamics. 

One interesting feature is the presence in the spectrum of massive
vector mesons that couple universally to the rest of the mesons. 
This is similar to what happens with the -meson in QCD.
In our case the universality of the coupling is due to the gauge
invariance of the eight-dimensional D7-brane action, whose 
dimensional reduction gives the four-dimensional effective 
meson Lagrangian. The gauge vector meson is nothing else than the
dimensional reduction of the gauge field on the D7-brane. In QCD
the universality of the coupling has also been attributed to a hidden
gauge symmetry and it would be interesting to see 
if these two ideas are related.

The fact that we obtained the meson masses in closed form allowed us 
to uncover an unexpected classification of the free spectrum in  
representations, even though the theory possesses only a manifest
 symmetry. For modes that transform 
in the same representation of  and  the  
is a symmetry, that is, all states in a given  multiplet have 
the same mass. The masses of mesons in different 
representations are not the same, but are related to one another in a very 
simple way. It would be interesting to analyze this 'symmetry enhancement' 
from the gauge theory viewpoint.

We noted that the meson radial mode functions peak more and more 
sharply at  as the meson R-charge  increases, and 
that this is precisely the value at which classical, point-like, 
collapsed massless open strings can orbit the  along a null
geodesic. These are potentially interesting because they are 
open-string analogues of the closed strings recently studied in 
. The latter are point-like, collapsed, massless 
closed strings that orbit the five-sphere of 5 5  along a 
null geodesic. The effective geometry seen by these strings is that 
of a Hpp-wave, as was derived in by taking
the Penrose limit of 5 5 . It was subsequently 
observed in that the same result can be obtained 
by simply expanding the string action for small fluctuations around 
the collapsed orbiting solution. The fact that the Penrose limit of a
supergravity solution is a solution itself is crucial,
because it guarantees the consistency of the quantum theory obtained by 
quantization of the above quadratic fluctuations of the string.
In view of the amount of progress 
recently made by studying Penrose limits of supergravity spacetimes 
with field theory duals, it would clearly be interesting to understand 
the dynamics of quadratic fluctuations of open strings around the
 geodesics above. Note that these are geodesics in the induced
metric on the D7-brane, but not  in the 5 5  geometry. 
Therefore the result will not simply be equivalent to some Penrose
limit, so quantum-mechanical consistency of the quadratic
approximation is not guaranteed.

As well as point-like behavior, we expect that the large R-charge
open-string states should exhibit expanded brane-like behavior, just as
in the closed-string sector.
We begin by addressing this issue in the massless quark
limit . Then one expects a direct correspondence
between single-particle supergravity and D7-brane BI modes 
in the 5 5  background and chiral primaries 
in the dual gauge theory. With the
set-up described in Sections  and , 
the operators 
defined in equation calx  would describe closed-string
states carrying total angular momentum  on the  of the  
D7-brane. For example, a closed string orbiting the  along 
a great circle in the 45-plane, say, would be described by 
the operator , where . 
As is well known, however, at finite ,
these operators are only independent for  because
of the finite rank of the gauge group. The truncation of this
family of operators at  is manifest in the AdS bulk
through the appearance of giant gravitons, ,
expanded spherical D3-branes following a trajectory on the above
circle. Of course, the precise gauge theory description of these
configurations is more intricate than implied above, involving
certain subdeterminant operators which implicitly
extend the above with the addition of a combination of multi-trace
operators.

Consider now the 'hypermultiplet' operators  
defined in calo  dual to gauge field modes on the D7-brane.
For large  these also carry angular momentum  on the
; the operator ,
for example, would describe open string states orbiting the great
circle in the 45-plane. For this family, the operators are 
only independent for 
for finite . This truncation should be realized in the AdS
space with the same extended D3-brane states as above. These
spherical D3-branes would intersect the D7-brane on an circle in
the 67-plane. Realizing the above hypermultiplet operators
would involve exciting a pair of (7,3) and (3,7) strings on this
intersection.(Modelling this intersection with the
intersection of planar D7- and D3-branes on a line indicates a
supersymmetric open string spectrum with massless ground state
modes. In the present case, however, where the D3-brane has a
finite spatial volume, consistency would require that the open
strings are excited in oppositely oriented pairs.)  
The precise gauge theory dual of these 'giant gauge bosons' 
is presumably closely related to the subdeterminant operators 
discussed in. A natural conjecture is that 
one of the adjoint fields  is replaced by the combination
.

The truncation of the hypermultiplet operators is certainly
unaffected by the quark masses, and so one expects that giant
gauge bosons still play a role with . The precise description
of the AdS configurations is more complicated but presumably
involves an expanded spherical D3-brane connected to the D7-brane
with a pair of open strings. It would be interesting to
investigate these states in more detail. Studying the dual giant gauge
bosons, analogous to the dual giant gravitons, may
also provide useful insights.

To obtain the spectrum of mesons with large spin  we considered  
semiclassical rotating open strings attached to the D7-brane, 
following the approach of for closed strings. 
We solved the string equations of motion numerically for arbitrary
, and analytically in the limiting regimes  and 
. An important subtlety was that the strings must end orthogonally 
on the D7-brane, from which it followed that the
endpoints move at subluminal speed. This should be contrasted with the
analogous case in flat space, in which the
string would actually be contained within the D-brane
and its endpoints would move at the speed of light. The physical
difference between the two cases is that in AdS the 'weight' of the
string (that is, the non-trivial background) pulls it away from the
D-brane. At the endpoints of the string this force can be compensated 
by the string tension only if the string ends orthogonally on
the D-brane.

The result of the numerical integration was unexpected: 
for each angular velocity of the string there is an infinite 
number of solutions distinguished by the
number of nodes  of the string (see Figure
). The projection on the AdS boundary suggests 
a structure of the corresponding meson in which the two quarks 
are surrounded by concentrical shells of gluons
associated to each of the pieces of string between two successive
nodes. 

We argued that, presumably, the solution with no
nodes is the most stable, since a string is prone to breaking at a
self-intersection point, a process that in the gauge theory
would correspond to the decay of an excited meson via the emission of
a gluon shell. We therefore concentrated on nodeless
solutions, the spectrum of which is shown in Figure .

Summary of the meson spectrum; on the right-hand side we have
  written the type of dual stringy mode. 
 

For  the string is much shorter than the AdS radius and 
the spectrum is accordingly that of flat space, , it follows a Regge 
trajectory. The effective tension, which we computed 
analytically to be , can be interpreted 
as a proper tension, , appropriately red-shifted. 
A 'hanging string' calculation confirmed that the static quark-anti quark 
potential in this regime is linear in the distance between the quarks 
with the effective tension above. 

For  the spectrum is drastically modified and takes the
form , where  is given in
kappa . The form of the binding energy  is precisely that of
two non-relativistic masses bound by a Coulomb potential. Again this
was confirmed by a static 'hanging string' calculation.
From the field theory viewpoint this is understood from the fact 
that in this regime the distance between the quark-anti quark pair 
is much larger than the inverse mass of the lightest meson. 
This means that the interactions are almost solely due to 
the exchange of fields in the  vector multiplet, 
which leads to a Coulomb potential. 

The meson spectrum is summarized in Figure .

   
We would like to remark that the results obtained here are 
interesting not only for their implications 
for the dual field theory, but also in themselves because they 
provide a prediction for the spectrum of open
strings on D7-branes in 5 5 . Similar results should
presumably be obtained for other D-branes in curved backgrounds.
