We study compactifications of Einstein gravity on product spaces
in vacuum and their acceleration phases.  Scalar potentials for
the dimensionally reduced effective theory are found to be of
exponential form and exact solutions are obtained for a class of
product spaces.  The inflation in our solutions is not sufficient
for the early universe.  We comment on the possibility of
obtaining sufficient inflation by compactification in general.



 


Introduction  
In most models of inflation, the source of inflation is a positive
potential energy from a scalar field which dominates over the
kinetic energy.  The precise contribution of the scalar field is
still undetermined, except that the potential has to be flat
enough in order to produce sufficient inflation. Recently it has
been shown that four dimensional accelerating universes can be
obtained from pure gravity in higher dimensions
. In these models(The solutions of
Ref.  correspond to taking the zero-flux limit of the
S-brane solutions in Refs. . Previous work on
accelerating cosmologies from time dependent flat internal spaces
include Refs. .)  the role of the inflaton is
played by the scalars coming from the higher dimensional metric
after dimensional reduction. These models therefore have the
attractive feature that the scalar field potential arises in a
natural way and is completely determined by gravity.

The no go theorem in Ref. , states that Einstein gravity
coupled to any matter fields with positive kinetic energies can
not generate non-singular warped compactifications to de Sitter
space  (nor ) with finite  dimensional Newton
constant, unless there is a positive potential for some scalar
fields.  An assumption in this no go theorem is that the
compactified dimensions are time independent. Discarding this
assumption, Townsend and Wohlfarth found an accelerating
phase for hyperbolic compactifications( We shall assume
that  is compact. This can be achieved by taking a quotient
of the noncompact hyperbolic space by a discrete subgroup of the
isometry group. Since the particular choice of the subgroup and
its action does not affect the local Einstein equations, we do not
have to specify these details in this paper. Refs. 
 discuss some aspects of compact hyperbolic extra dimensions
for cosmology.)  of the form .

The fact that we need negative curvature for acceleration can be
understood from the following observation. For a product space
with metric ds^2 = ^2 ds_4^2 + ^2 ds_n^2, the Hilbert
Einstein action is  S &=& d^4+n  x -g  

&=& d^n x g_n  d^4 x -g_4  ^4 ^n [
 _4  ^2  + _n ^2  + ],
where ,  (, ) are the curvature and
metric defined by  () (The additional terms
in the bracket involving derivatives of the scalars , 
are 

) .

When , the  dimensional action simplifies
into the sum of the 4D Hilbert Einstein action plus an action for
the scalar field = , which determines the size
of extra dimensions. The line element  is now the
metric in 4D Einstein frame.

The second term in () acts as a scalar field potential for



V = - _n
e^-(n+2) .
Therefore in order to have a positive potential we need
to compactify a space with negative curvature.  For extra
dimensions of constant curvature, that is spherical or hyperbolic
spaces, we see from () that the potential has an
exponential form. (For the flat case the potential vanishes.)

Except for very large , the parameters in the theory are all of
order  which is a problem in generating inflation from the
potential in (). To have large acceleration, we need large
, but this also implies large slope  and so
the kinetic energy quickly catches up according to the equation of
motion for . Therefore the number of e-foldings of such
inflationary models is expected to be only of order . This is
indeed the case for compactification on a single hyperbolic space
. If we generalize this setup to extra dimensions which
are product spaces for example, this problem might be evaded
because there are more scalars and more complicated potentials.
The situation might be similar to the hybrid model of inflation.
We construct a model in Sec.  showing that sufficient
inflation can be achieved even if all parameters are of order .

The plan of the paper is as follows. In Sec. , we give a
general formulation of Einstein gravity in vacuum for product
spaces of flat, spherical and hyperbolic spaces. In
Sec. , we begin with a review of compactifications on a
single hyperbolic space , and then analyze the
next simplest case, a product of two compact spaces
.  Although we did not find
sufficient inflation for these cases, but we show in
Sec.  that in principle, similar models with only
coefficients of order one can produce eternal inflation. In
Sec.  we begin analysis of general product spaces
, where the large  dimensions
does not have to be flat and  does not have to be . We have
found exact solutions for the case , where
 can be a spherical, hyperbolic or flat space. Finally we
comment on our results in Sec. .


Generic case  
In this section we consider Einstein gravity in vacuum for
spacetimes which are products of an arbitrary number of spaces,
which are each either flat, spherical or hyperbolic.  In Subsec.
 we first give the vacuum Einstein equations, and then
treating the scale factors as scalar fields we rewrite the theory
from the dimensionally reduced viewpoint in Subsec. . The
advantage of this approach is that we can now apply our knowledge
of scalar field inflation.

Einstein equations for product spaces in vacuum 

Let us consider spacetimes of the form _0_1_n, which are products of flat, spherical
and hyperbolic spaces in addition to the time direction.  Each
factor of  can be either flat, spherical or hyperbolic which
we label by a numbers , which are  or ,
respectively. The dimension of each space  will be denoted
 for  so the total dimension is 
.  We define  by , and we will find the dimensional
reduction of the higher dimensions to .

Our metric ansatz for the vacuum solution is
 
where 
is the metric for the space 
given by
ds_i^2 = 
 .
 For each component of the product space, the
Ricci tensor is given by
  so the Ricci tensor for the full metric
() is relatively simple
 

 From the above expressions, we see that the equations simplify
using the gauge condition
 
This is merely a gauge condition corresponding to a time
reparametrization since all the functions depend only on time.  In
this gauge, the vacuum Einstein equations reduce to
 
Although the general solutions are not easy to obtain due to the
coupling between the differential equations, we have obtained
exact solutions for some particular cases. We will discuss some
of these solutions below.

Effective theory in lower dimension 

Let us assume that  corresponds to the large spatial dimensions in
which we live, so the 's are extra dimensions. We would like
to dimensionally reduce the theory to  and obtain an
effective theory of  dimensional
gravity coupled to scalar fields.

As noted in Sec. , the metric of the  dimensional
Einstein theory is different from the  dimensional part of the
full metric. We rewrite () as  ds^2 =
^2 a^2(-d^2+ds_0^2) +_i=1 ^n a_i^2 ds_i^2, where
 is the conformal time in the  dimensional Einstein
frame,  is the  dimensional scale factor and  =
_i=1 ^n  _i, with  _i =
a_i^-m_i d-1  . The Einstein tensor is
G_00 &=&d(d-1) 2 
(a' a )^2 -  a^2, 

G_11 &=&-(d-1)(d-4) 2  (a' a )^2
-(d-1)a" a  - p  a^2,
where  and  can
be identified with the energy density and pressure in 
dimensional space. The other non-vanishing components of the
Einstein tensor give redundant equations. In the above we have denoted the
derivative of  by a prime: .

 From  and  we deduce the kinetic and potential
terms(Potentials coming from compactifications were
discussed in Ref. .)  for the scalar fields K&=&+p 2 =
_i=1 ^nm_i(m_i+d-1) 2(d-1)a^2 +_i>j=1 ^n m_i m_j (d-1)a^2 -_0d-1 2a^2 , 

&=& _i=1 ^n1 2a^2 +_i>j=1 ^n 2c_i c_j a^2 -_0d-1 2a^2 ,  

V&=&2 = _i=1 ^n (-_i)m_i(m_i-1) 2 
e^-2d-1  ( (m_i+d-1)_i + _ji ^1jn m_j_j ) 
-_0(d-1)^2 2a^2 , 

&=& _i=1 ^n (-_i)m_i(m_i-1) 2 
e^2d-1  (_i/c_i +2_ji ^1jn c_j_j)  -_0(d-1)^2 2a^2 ,
 where c_i = m_i 2(m_i+d-1)  ,
and the scalar fields ,  are defined by a_i=e^_i , _i = -
2(d-1) c_i m_i _i. From () we then
have _i = e^2d-1    c_i _i . 




The last terms in
() and () are the contributions from the
curvature of the  dimensional space.

The effective Lagrangian is ()
( In our convention, the
factor  is included in , and so the
action is just .) 
L = -g  ( R  2 + K - V
) = a^d+1  [ -d(d-1) 2 (
a' a^2 )^2

+K-V ]. The action for the scalar fields can also be
derived from the Hilbert Einstein action in higher dimensions,
up to total derivatives, as we explain in Appendix A.

It is well known that off-diagonal terms
omitted in () are gauge fields from the lower
dimensional viewpoint. We can include their effect by adding
Yang-Mills Lagrangian to the effective action, but the gauge
coupling will be a function of the scalar fields. If we redefine
the gauge field to absorb these factors so that the gauge
coupling is constant, we are effectively introducing charges to
the scalar fields. We will not pursue this effect here.





Simple Product Spaces  
In this section we study the acceleration of the product spaces
 and .

  
Our ansatz for the spacetime metric of 
 is
 ds^2 =  ^2 
(-a^2d dt^2+a^2dx_(d) ^2) + ^-4/m 
r_h^2 ds_1^2  , and  is taken to be an -dimensional compact hyperbolic
space with the metric  given by ()
for .






The ansatz (), with ^2(t)=(e^d_0
t  K(t) )^m/(m-1) , a^2(t)=
(K(t) e^(1+2/m)_0 t  )^m/(m-1)  ,solves the vacuum Einstein equations for
  K(t) = _0 r_h (m-1)  
 [_0t-t_1] , d+d(d-1) m  ,where  is an integration constant. This solution
was first found in Ref.  when . Henceforth we take
, , and shift the time so that .

The proper time for a four-dimensional observer (i.e., ) is
measured by , with . The
metric () then takes the form ds^2 = ^2()
 (-d^2+a^2()dx^2) + ^-4/m ()ds_1^2. According
to (), the potential of  is V = m(m-1) 2  e^/c_m  where  c_m = m 2(m+2)  . In order to have sufficient inflation, the potential can not be
too steep, otherwise  rolls down the hill too quickly
and the inflationary era will be too short. The slow roll condition
 is satisfied if .
However,  is bounded by .

















The 4D spacetime is expanding if
da d >0  n_1(t)1+m m+2   (t)<0,  with  defined in (). The expansion is
accelerating only if d^2a d^2 >0n_2(t)m(m-1)^2 
 (m+2)^2^2[t] > (n_1(t))^2 . The conditions (), () are satisfied
 simultaneously for  in a certain interval. A small but
 negative time  actually corresponds to a positive proper
 time . Specifically, in the limit , we find
 -
(1 t )^(m+2)/2(m-1) , a (1 t )^m/2(m-1)  . This also implies that the singularity of the function  at 
corresponds to  in Einstein frame.

An intuitive understanding of why the acceleration occurs at negative
time  is given in.
Numerical studies show that the number of e-foldings
 ( The initial time  and
final time  are defined by the times when the scale factor
 starts and stops to accelerate, respectively. )  N =
(a(t_f) a(t_i) )
=_t_i ^t_f  dt H is of order , see table .
(Here  is the Hubble parameter.)
The solution for the spacetime metric  is
therefore not applicable for implementing inflation
in the early universe.
We note that the initial condition  does not
significantly affect the value of , because a larger initial
velocity will shoot up the hill to a higher point, which is good
for inflation, but it will roll down faster as the slope is also larger
at higher points.

In this section we consider the spacetimes 
, which are the product of a large 3 dimensional flat
space and two compact spaces. The ansatz for the spacetime
metric is
ds^2 = ^2() a^2() (-d^2+dx^2)
+_1^2() ds__1 ^2+_2^2() ds^2__2 , &= _1_2, _1 = e^c_m_1 , _2 = e^c_n_2 , 

&_1 = _1^-2/m , _2 = _2^-2/n ,
where the metric for  and  are of the form given in (),
and their dimensions are  and .

As shown in Sec. , the Einstein theory dimensionally reduced
to 4D is equivalent to 4D Einstein gravity coupled to
scalar fields ,  with the kinetic term
K = 1 a^2  (
1 2 (+ 2 c_m c_n ),
and the potential
V = V_m,_1  e^2c_n_2  + V_n,_2 
e^2c_m_1 ,
where  are given by
V_m,_i =-_im(m-1) 2 e^_i/c_m .
Let us define the new scalars
_1 = _1+2 c_m c_n_2, _2 = c_mn _2,
so that the kinetic terms take
the canonical form
. In these variables the
potential term becomes
V = -_1 m(m-1) 2  e^_1/c_m  -
_2 n(n-1) 2  e^2c_m_1+c_mn _2/c_n ,
c_mn  = 2(m+n+2) (m+2)(n+2)  .
This resembles a hybrid model for inflation.


Parameters of order  vs.  e-foldings 


For the spacetimes  studied in
Sec. , the scalar potential is  V =
e^2_1  + e^_1+3 _2 . for ,
.  One might be tempted to claim that it is
impossible for this potential to generate sufficient inflation
because all the parameters here are of order one. How can we
obtain 60 e-foldings from such a potential?

Although it is true that for this particular model we
can not obtain sufficient inflation, the argument above
is over-simplifying the problem. Let us demonstrate
this with an explicit example showing that the
interaction between two fields can lead to a
surprising difference from the naive expectation.

Numerical results 

The potential we examine
 V = e^2_1/3  +
e^3_1+3 _2 , is of the same form as the
one in (), where all parameters are of order one. The only
difference between these two potentials is the
coefficients of  in the exponents.

The equations of motion for the scalar fields
expressed in the physical time  () are
 _i+3H _i+V _i  = 0,
and the Friedman equation
H^2 = 1 3 (K+V)
determines the evolution of the scale factor .

We have studied the expansion of this  model numerically. For two
2nd order differential equation, we can set four initial values
 and . If we fix the
initial condition so that it coincides with the starting point of
acceleration, we first set three of the initial values,
, , , and this fixes
the initial value of  by requiring that ,
or equivalently  at . A set of such initial conditions
is .
Note that all the initial values of this set are of order , and
the results will be qualitatively the same for variations of order
 for the initial conditions.

Our numerical study showed that the acceleration never stops, but
asymptotes to zero acceleration, . The
evolution of ,  and the scale factor  are
given in Figures 1, 2 and
3, respectively. In contrast, the results for the
potential () from dimensional reduction are plotted in
Figures 4-6. Note that the time
scales of the plots are quite different.

The Hubble parameter 
is found to be 
at , respectively.
The corresponding e-folding number is
, respectively.
It is remarkable that while the two potentials
() and () are so similar,
their spacetime evolutions are so drastically different.

The behavior of the coupled system is quite interesting. We see
from the figure of  that it asymptotes to a constant as
. The only difference we noticed between the potentials
() and () which might be the crucial here is that
the relative magnitude of the coefficients of  in the two
exponents in  is reversed. It will be very interesting to
understand better the mechanism behind the model () that
leads to eternal inflation. This knowledge will be important for
inflationary model building.

Exact solutions 


In the above we studied numerically models of two scalar fields
with the exponential potential V =
e^b_1 +e^c_1+d_2 . In fact, exact solutions can
also be obtained. From the ansatz  _i = p_i
t + q_i, H = h t , we find the solution &p_1=-2 b , p_2=-2(b-c) bd , 

&e^bq_1 =2(3h-1)(d^2-c(b-c)) b^2 d^2 , e^cq_1+dq_2 =2(3h-1)(b-c) bd^2 , and h =
2(d^2+(b-c)^2) b^2 d^2 . These special solutions are either acceleration for all  or
deceleration for all . The condition for acceleration is .
For the potentials from compactification on  in
Sec , h=m_1+m_2 m_1+m_2+2  < 1, and there is
no inflation. For the hypothetical model () we studied
numerically in the previous subsection, .

To understand the form and simplicity of these solutions it is
useful to change variables from  to . For the case
where the extra dimensions are , we have b=2, c=1, d=3 , 

p_1=-1, p_2=-1 3  . 


The time dependence of the 's is given by
 

_2=

-2 3  t + constant ,
so we find  and  have the same time
dependence. This result is consistent with the fact that
 is a symmetry axis of the potential; our
numerical simulations confirm the intuition that most solutions
tend to fall along this line of attraction due to energy lost to
cosmic friction.

Comparing these solutions to the general solution for a single
product space , we see that these solutions can be understood
as the  limit of the generic solutions
.  If we understand these solutions as representing
future infinity, we see that although we can start with generic
solutions, their eventual fate seems to be that the different
hyperbolic spaces attain the same time dependence.

In the next section we will find exact solutions where the product
spaces all have the same time dependence and we find that
inflation is not improved. If all solutions are generically
attracted to the symmetry axis, then eternal inflation is
apparently ruled out when the product spaces are all of the same
type.

Apparently the ansatz () can be easily applied to an
arbitrary number of scalar fields with exponential potential.
Exact solutions of this class will be reported in a follow up
paper.



Product spaces  
The eternal inflation in the hybrid model of
the previous section motivates us to look for
solutions for more general product spaces as
extra dimensions.

Equal Product Spaces 

In this subsection, we discuss the case of  copies of : 
 and
. For this case the equation for
 can be solved
 
where  and  are integration constants, and the
variable
A = d (_0 t + _0) + m n B
is determined by the gauge condition (). Then
the only equations we need to solve are () and () for 
 
The change of variables
 
 
simplifies the equations of motion
 
where . The solutions of this differential
equation are
 
where the value of  is fixed from () to be
 
The constants  and  can be set as  and
 by rescaling and shifting time .

Following the ansatz (), the ()-dimensional
Einstein frame metric for this generic case is
 
When  is a hyperbolic space (i.e., ), we have
 
with
 
In terms of the proper time coordinate , with
 
the metric () can be written in the standard
FLRW form as
 
The accelerating phase occurs when
 
which, after a straightforward calculation, give






&- mnd - mn+d-1  > 0, 

&d(mn-1)^2- (mnd + mn+d-1 )^2 >0,
where .  It is interesting that this
equation is dependent only on the product  and not  or 
separately.  For these particular solutions we find that the
period of acceleration and the number of e-foldings are the same
for  and product spaces such as  copies of .

Analysis of these conditions shows that acceleration phases exist
for all values of . We find larger
e-foldings for smaller  and larger . For , inflation
can last forever, although the acceleration eventually approaches
to zero. For , the number of e-foldings is of order one for
 of order 100 or smaller.

We finally note that for the case of a simple product space, going
to higher dimensions  and  actually decreases the amount of
inflation. In arbitrary  dimensions, the slow roll condition
becomes
 
which is consistent with our results that inflation for  can
last forever.  For the spacetime  the potential
is of exponential form and we find
 
which is of order  for the case where we take ,
and also for the case where we take  large. While going to
large  does flatten out the potential which is good for
obtaining large inflation, going to large  also increases the
cosmic friction. Going to large  therefore does not help us
satisfy the slow roll conditions and does not increase the amount
of inflation.

Apparently there is no room for a realistic inflation model for
the early universe using the solutions found in this subsection.


Discussion  
In this paper, we generalized the work ofand considered compactifications of product spaces
of flat, spherical and hyperbolic spaces.
Unfortunately, for all the cases we studied,
the acceleration phases are still not sufficient.
Nevertheless,
we can not yet conclude that
 e-foldings cannot be achieved from pure gravity
compactification.

For the product spaces considered in Sec. ,
the exact solutions we found are only very special solutions.
In general each space in the product can have
a different scale factor,
but we have only found solutions with
a single overall scale factor
for the extra dimensions.
At least numerically,
one can also study products spaces
for which we did not obtain exact solutions.
In view of the importance of interactions between
scalar fields which we discussed in Sec. ,
the phase diagram for the solutions can be very complicated
and the implication of the special solutions
can not be taken too far.

Since we know that radiation induces deceleration,
adding off-diagonal components into the full spacetime metric
does not seem so promising. Similarly, in view of the no go
theorem of, adding matter fields will probably not
help. It would be interesting to know whether
modifications to Einstein theory, such as
Brans Dicke theory or adding Gauss Bonnet terms
will admit solutions with sufficient acceleration.

If we assume that the compactified
space is stabilized before nucleosynthesis
in order not to violate observational data,
it will be hard to apply the acceleration
associated with the shrinking of extra dimensions
to explain the acceleration of the present universe.
This is why we have kept in mind the inflation
of the early universe as our main application.
But a more careful study is needed before this
possibility is completely ruled out.

Although this original setup of Townsend and Wohlfarth does not
provide large e-foldings for a three dimensional universe, it is
possible that with modification, solutions with large amounts of
inflation can be found from a suitable high energy starting point
using gravity as the source of inflation. In a follow up paper we
will discuss the details of these more complicated scenarios.
