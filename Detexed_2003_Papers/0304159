We show that renormalized non-commutative scalar field theories do not
reduce to their planar sector in the limit of large non-commutativity.
This follows from the fact that the RG equation of the
Wilson-Polchinski type which describes the genus zero sector of
non-commutative field theories couples generic planar amplitudes with
non-planar amplitudes at exceptional values of the external
momenta. We prove that the renormalization problem can be consistently
restricted to this set of amplitudes. In the resulting renormalized
theory non-planar divergences are treated as UV divergences requiring
appropriate non-local counterterms. In 4 dimensions the model turns
out to have one more relevant (non-planar) coupling than its
commutative counterpart. This non-planar coupling is "evanescent":
although in the massive (but not in the massless) case its
contribution to planar amplitudes vanishes when the floating cut-off
equals the renormalization scale, this coupling is needed to make the
Wilsonian effective action UV finite at all  values of the
floating cut-off.

Introduction 

The aim of this paper is to address some issues which arise in the
renormalization of non-commutative quantum field theories in the limit
when the non-commutativity parameter  is large. Feynman
diagrams of non-commutative theories, like those of matrix field
theories, have a double line representation and thus admit a
topological classification in terms of oriented Riemann surfaces with
holes to which external lines are attached.  Diagrams with spherical
topology are called planar  when they have a single hole to which
all the external lines are attached - in the matrix theories these
are also called single trace diagrams.  Non-planar  spherical
diagrams have more than one hole and, in the matrix models, correspond
to multi-trace terms of the effective action.

The current understanding of the renormalization of non-commutative
theories is based on the observation that planar diagrams have
exactly the same divergences as in the commutative theory.
Divergences of non-planar graphs are instead 
automatically regulated, in the non-commutative theory, by an
effective UV cut-off , where  is the momentum
entering a hole of the diagram. Since the
effective UV cut-off diverges when the momentum  entering
a hole vanishes, non-planar diagrams diverge when evaluated
at exceptional  values of the external momenta - the famous 
IR/UV mixing effect. Therefore it has been conjectured
 that to remove all UV divergences of non-commutative 
amplitudes at generic  values of the external momenta,
it is sufficient to introduce counterterms corresponding
to planar divergences only. In the following we will refer to this
as the "planar renormalization" scheme of non-commutative theories.
Explicit computations up to two loops have been performed that seem to
confirm this expectation .

That planar renormalization should work is not "a priori" obvious  
and might in fact even appear to be surprising, since planar amplitudes 
have in general non-planar subgraphs: these subgraphs
necessarily appear at exceptional values of their external momenta and thus,
in planar renormalization, may lead to unsubtracted divergences. 
In this paper we will be able to explain when and in which -
limited - sense planar renormalization "works".
 
The technical tool that we use to investigate the renormalization of
non-commutative theories is the Wilson-Polchinski renormalization
group equation that we derived in.  This equation, which
applies both to the large  limit of matrix field theories and to the
large  limit of non-commutative theories, describes the RG evolution
of amplitudes with  topology. It makes manifest the
impossibility of limiting the renormalization problem to planar
diagrams: the RG evolution of a generic planar amplitude involves
necessarily non-planar spherical amplitudes. However, the non-planar
amplitudes that are coupled by the RG flow to the planar ones are not
generic - they are restricted to momenta configurations for which
the total momenta  entering each hole of the non-planar amplitude
vanish. We will refer to the amplitudes restricted to such
exceptional momenta as the Partially Integrated Spherical  (PIS)
amplitudes: in configuration space they are Green functions
integrated over the centers of mass of all the points attached to the
same hole. PIS amplitudes include both planar amplitudes evaluated
at generic momenta and non-planar amplitude taken at exceptional
momenta. We see that the RG approach to renormalization of non-commutative theories
naturally leads to consider a special class of non-local observables, 
corresponding to PIS amplitudes. It should be kept in mind that
renormalized non-planar PIS amplitudes cannot be considered as
limits - for  -  of generic non-planar spherical amplitudes.
However, since the RG equation closes over PIS amplitudes 
the renormalization problem for this set of amplitudes  
is well formulated in the Wilson-Polchinski
framework. This is the problem that we will solve
in this paper by showing that the theory
of PIS amplitudes of non-commutative field theory
is renormalizable(The PIS sector of matrix field theory also
defines a consistent renormalization problem. However for matrix field
theory one can as well consider the renormalization of generic
spherical amplitudes.) : both in the sense that renormalized amplitudes
are finite when the the UV cut-off is removed and in the Wilsonian
sense that the Wilson-Polchinski effective action
is independent of the UV scale for any value of the floating cut-off .

In conclusion, PIS theory is the renormalizable theory which describes
the  limit of non-commutative field theory. 
We believe, although we do not address this issue in this paper,
that it also encodes the whole UV non-trivial content of the 
non-commutative theory at finite : in other words we think
that, once PIS sub-divergences have been subtracted, the only
divergences left are to be treated as IR ones, as suggested in.

The difference between planar
renormalization and our renormalization scheme is illuminated by a
factorization property of the  limit of
non-commutative theory that is the direct analogue of large 
factorization of matrix models.  Factorization follows from the fact
that the RG equation for  - unlike the ordinary
commutative RG equation - is of first order  in source
derivatives. It is because of factorization that, when the Polchinski
floating cut-off  equals the mass renormalization scale, 
the renormalized planar amplitudes depend on one less
marginal coupling than generic non-planar PIS amplitudes.  In this
sense one can say that the non-planar coupling is evanescent . It
turns out that in the massive  theory one can neglect the non-planar
coupling if one only looks at planar amplitudes at
, where  is
the renormalization scale: in other words, 
when the floating IR cut-off  equals   the planar
part of our Wilsonian effective action coincides with the effective
action that one would obtain from planar renormalization.
However, as soon as  differs from  the planar
effective action obtained from PIS theory and the one which neglects
non-planar divergences begin to differ from one another: the "naive"
planar effective action becomes dependent on the UV scale  while 
the effective action coming from PIS theory does
not(The planar part of the Wilsonian action obtained by 
planar renormalization  depends on the UV scale  when the 
external momenta are  generic , as we will show in Section 2
by a specific computation. This disagrees with the opposite claim
made in.) .  
The fact that the "naive" planar effective action 
depends on  when 
might, at first sight, appear surprising since the Wilson-Polchinski 
RG equation is essentially independent of the UV scale : 
the reason why this happens is that the RG equation does not close on
planar amplitudes and the  derivative of a planar amplitude
involves non-planar diagrams evaluated at exceptional momenta which
are, in planar renormalization, divergent.
Hence the non-trivial dependence on 
of the "naive" planar effective action is the  "shadow" 
at the planar level of the IR/UV difficulty that afflicts non-planar 
amplitudes computed in planar renormalization.

Our renormalization framework can also be applied to the 
massless theory: this theory is particularly interesting since its
UV and IR divergences conspire
to produce an anomalous dependence of the planar amplitudes on the
non-planar coupling at . Had one neglected
non-planar counterterms in the massless case,   
one would have obtained an effective planar action UV divergent 
for any  value of , including when .

 
The reason why non-planar counterterms can be introduced in PIS theory 
is that non-planar PIS amplitudes depend on the non-commutative parameter  via an overall Moyal phase. More precisely, let 
the Moyal phase of a planar diagram be  
e ^-i _n(p_1,, p_n)  e ^-i_i<j  p_i
p_j 
where 
and  are the momenta associated to the  external
lines of the graph(We will
assume  to be a non-degenerate anti-symmetric matrix
and we will consider the euclidean theory.) . 
In Appendix A it will be shown that
a PIS amplitude
with  holes depend on the  via an overall factor
which is the product of  factors like () -
one for each hole. This should be contrasted with the complicated dependence
on  of non-planar amplitudes at generic external momenta,
for which the Moyal phases associated with the interaction vertices 
do not factor out of Feynman diagram integrands, leading to
amplitudes that do not have a  limit uniform in
the external momenta. 

PIS theory is not a local quantum field theory. Beyond
the somewhat "obvious" non-locality (common to both the planar
and the non-planar sector) due to the
overall Moyal factors, there is also a non-locality which is 
associated with the vanishing of the total momenta entering
the holes of the non-planar amplitudes. 
As a consequence the effective action of PIS theory that
we will construct via the RG Wilson-Polchinski equation does
not have a functional integral representation based on 
some "local" (even in the non-commutative sense) space-time
action.  PIS theory represents an interesting example -
and to our knowledge the first non-trivial one - of a renormalizable 
theory of (partially integrated) Green functions
which can be rigorously defined and constructed 
only via the Wilson-Polchinski approach.

It is also intriguing to observe that PIS amplitudes are
in one-to-one correspondence, via the Eguchi-Kawai (EK) construction ,
with the multi-trace spherical amplitudes of a 0-dimensional
matrix model in the  limit. To see this, let us first briefly
recall the basic idea underlying the EK construction: the momenta 
flowing through propagators of planar   double line Feynman diagrams
of some (matrix or non-commutative) -dimensional field theory
admit a representation in terms of pseudo-momenta   as
, where the double indices  label the propagator.
The pseudo-momenta  for  are taken to form 
a regular lattice in momentum space centered around  and of 
size equal to the ultra-violet
cut-off . By replacing integrations over -dimensional 
momenta  with sums over the discrete indices  one obtains
amplitudes which are regularized both in the UV and in the IR.
Then, a (regulated) planar Feynman diagram of (matrix
or non-commutative) -dimensional field theory
equals a planar diagram of a 0-dimensional matrix model with
the same potential as the field theory and  with
propagator given by 
. It is maybe not widely appreciated that the map
between field theory and matrix model diagrams 
holds not only for the planar diagrams but more generally for 
PIS amplitudes: in fact this is precisely the property 
that characterizes  such amplitudes. Thus the PIS restriction
appears to be very natural from the EK construction point of view:
the PIS sector of a (non-commutative) field theory is precisely 
the one described by the EK 0-dimensional matrix model.
In other words, the EK 0-dimensional matrix model is renormalizable
and captures the UV structure of non-commutative field theory.

The plan of this paper is the following: in Section 2 we write
the RG Wilson-Polchinski equation for the large  (large )
limit of non-commutative (matrix) field theory.
We use this equation to prove the renormalizability 
of the scalar 4-dimensional theory
and show that the marginal couplings also include the non-planar coupling 
 associated with the 4-point functions with 2 holes and 2 legs
in each hole(The genus 0 RG equation of the scalar theory in 4d with
quartic interaction can be consistently projected
to the "even" parity sector: this consists of the amplitudes
with an even  number of external legs in each hole.
In the explicit examples that we consider we will focus on this
sector.) . This is the coupling that in the matrix model corresponds to
the multi-trace operator .  In Section 3 we use the 
large  RG equation to prove
the factorization property of PIS amplitudes and spell out its consequences
for the renormalization of both massive and massless non-commutative field
theories. In particular, in the massless case we derive the renormalized 
parametric equation that captures the anomalous dependence of planar 
amplitudes on the non-planar coupling  at : we compute
at the lowest (2 loop) non-trivial order the generalized beta functions
that appear in this parametric equation. 
In Appendixes A and B we discuss the  dependence of
spherical and higher-genus diagrams respectively.  We verify that
partially integrated amplitudes of genus  go as  for
, while amplitudes generic external momenta do not
have a uniform  limit.  In Appendix C we derive the
Wilson-Polchinski RG equation for the generating functional of
one-particle irreducible amplitudes in the large  (large )
limit.

infra-red one .  Notice that  depends on the
UV cut-off  via the regulated propagators, though we will  
drop explicit reference to the ultra-violet scale 
in this section. 

To analyse the renormalization properties of the non-commutative field
theory it is convenient to introduce the generating functional 
 of the one-particle irreducible (1PI) 
spherical amplitudes  
 :
^_[]_h=0 ^ _k_1,, k_h _i=1 ^h[
__i=1 ^k_i [dp^(i) __i  ]
_k_i  (C_i)]
(_i,_i p^(i) __i  )
 ^(h;  k_i)  _ [C_1,,C_h]

As proved in Appendix C, the RG equation for the 1PI functional writes as 
follows:
&&__= 12 _n=1 ^ dP_0 dP_n-1  (P_0 )(P_1 )(P_n-1  )

&&_i=1 ^n[ _k_i _I_i=0 ^k_i-2  __i=1 ^I_i  
dp^(i) __i  __i=1 ^k_i-2-I_i  dq^(i) __i  k_i __k_i (P_i-1  , C_i,
- P_i  , C^_i) ]

&& 
__i I_i  (C_n,, C_1)
 __i k_i-2-I_i  (C^_1,, C^_n)
where , 
and  is defined by 
_[] = ^_[] +12 dp 
(p) _2(p,-p)

Eq. () translates into evolution equations for
the amplitudes  which
have following schematic structure
&&_^(h+2) _[C_1,,C_h+2 ]= 12

and are graphically represented in Figure .
The R.H.S. of this equation involves several sums which we indicated with 
: (a) 
the sum over  the possible ways
to select 2 holes  and  
(with  and  external legs respectively) among the  holes 
 of 
the amplitude on the L.H.S.; (b) the sum over the ways to partition 
the external
momenta of  and  into  subsets of consecutive momenta 

and , with  
and ; (c) the sum over the possible ways to distribute
the remaining  holes into the  sets denoted in Eq. () by

(C_I^(i) __i  )
where   is the total momentum entering the hole .

Note that, thanks to Eq. (),  
the total momenta entering the holes of the amplitudes
 appearing on the R.H.S. of Eq. ()
are linear combinations of the momenta  entering the holes
of the amplitude  on the L.H.S. Thus,
if the momenta configurations appearing in the L.H.S. are  exceptional  
- i.e. if all the  -
then the amplitudes involved in the R.H.S. are also 
evaluated at exceptional momenta. We will call these amplitudes
partially integrated spherical  (PIS) amplitudes.
Hence, Eq. () implies that the RG evolution can be consistently
restricted to PIS amplitudes. 

It is worth remarking that Eq. () predicts the factorization
of the 
dependence of PIS amplitudes that we anticipated in the Introduction
and worked out in the Appendix A.
Indeed assume that at any  scale  the  dependence
of a PIS amplitude with  holes 
 is the product
of the Moyal factors 
associated with each hole: then it can be verified
that the product of the Moyal factors of the
amplitudes  which enter the
R.H.S. of the evolution equation () equals the product 
of the Moyal factors associated
with the  holes  which appear on the L.H.S. 
In other words, the RG evolution equation for large  implies 
that the  dependence of PIS amplitudes is restricted
to the Moyal factors and hence  does not run.

Let us therefore introduce the generating functional for PIS amplitudes:
 _[]_h=0 ^ ^d(h - 1) _k_1,, k_h 
_i=1 ^h
[__i=1 ^k_i 
[dp^(i) __i  ]
_k_i  (C_i)(P (C_i))]
 ^(h;  k_i)  _ [C_1,,C_h]
where the  factors have been introduced to keep
 dimensionless.   satisfies an
RG evolution equation which is only slightly different than Eq. 
():

- P_i  ,q^(i) __i ) ]

&& (_i,_i p^(i) __i )__i I_i  (p^(n) __n ,,p^(1) __1 )

&& (_i,_i q^(i) __i )

where
D __+ d- d_k 
_i=1 ^kd p_i_k(p_1,,p_k)_k(p_1,,p_k) 
and we adopted the convention that 
(P (C))_k(C)^-d for  k=0
Starting from Eq. () one can prove the renormalizability
of the theory of PIS amplitudes in the Wilson-Polchinski sense. 
The evolution equation determines 
at an arbitrary value of  once initial conditions are
chosen. Initial conditions for the couplings 
are chosen either at the UV "high" scale  - for the
irrelevant couplings - or at the "low" scale
 - for the marginal and relevant ones. 
Renormalizability is proven by showing that the functional
 determined by these
initial conditions has a finite limit as  -
as marginal and relevant couplings at the scale  are
kept fixed.

The proof of renormalizability of the (non-local) theory of PIS amplitudes
follows the same arguments, based  on dimensional
analysis, which apply to (local) commutative
theories. Eq. () shows that the dependence of
the amplitudes on , for  much larger than
the external momenta, is the same as in the commutative case,
that is 
_^(h;  k_i)  [C_1,,C_h]^d -_i=1 ^h n(C_i) 
where  is the number of legs attached to the hole ,
and where possible logarithmic dependence is not explicitly
indicated. Indeed, if we choose for concreteness a sharp cut-off
for the propagator(Any momentum cut-off which falls off 
sufficiently fast will do.) :
(p) = 1p^2 +m^2 [(^2- p^2)- (^2_0 - p^2)]
we have 
(P_0) (^2 - P_0^2)
It is then immediate to verify that the scaling law ()
is consistent with the evolution equation (). 
Specializing now our considerations to the  case, it follows
from Eq. () that
the relevant and marginal couplings are those associated
with amplitudes with 2 or 4 external legs:
&&N _m^2 [_]
_^2 (0,0)

&&N _Z [_]
_p^2 _^2 (p,-p)_p=0 

&&N _g [_]
_^4 (0,0,0,0)

&&N _ [_]
_^2,2 (0,0; 0,0)
where , 
 are the planar 2- and 4-point functions
and  is the non-planar  4-point function
with 2 holes. The renormalization conditions for the massive
theory are set at a low energy
scale :
&N _m^2 [_]_= 0&

Z-1

&N _g [_]_= g&N _ [_]_For the massless theory, for which , one must replace
the first of the equations above with
N _m^2=0 [_]_0 = 0
and keep the others unchanged. All the other couplings are irrelevant
and thus can be chosen arbitrarily at the UV scale .
In the Wilson-Polchinski approach the non-commutative parameter 
appears in the initial condition for .  
The non-commutative Moyal theory is defined by 
setting the  dependence  of the irrelevant couplings 
with   holes, at the scale , 
to be the product of the Moyal factors associated with the same  holes:
as we remarked above, the RG evolution equation ensures that the
 dependence is preserved by the renormalization flow.

By integrating the evolution equation () with the boundary
conditions () 
(or ()) and using the scaling property 
() one shows, as in the usual
Polchinski framework, that the amplitudes have a finite limit
for . The same argument shows that 
that amplitudes evaluated at low momenta  and scale 
depend on the values of the irrelevant couplings at the scale
 as positive powers of  or
. 

Let us comment on the relevance of our results to
the celebrated IR-UV problem of non-commutative field
theories. In the approaches to renormalization of non-commutative
theories proposed so far  one introduces
counterterms only for planar divergences: non-planar
divergences are regulated by the effective UV cut-off 
, where  is the momentum entering a hole
of the diagram. Therefore, if  is external, the amplitude
develops an IR/UV divergence as . 
However, as stressed in the Introduction, non-planar divergences also 
occur as sub-divergences of
planar amplitudes: the consequence of this is that
even the planar  sector of the theory is not correctly
renormalized if only planar counterterms are introduced.
The Wilson-Polchinski approach makes this evident, 
since, as we have already emphasized, the RG equation
inevitably couples planar and non-planar amplitudes.
In the following subsection we will show explicitly that, if only planar
counterterms are introduced, one can remove the UV divergences of the
planar Wilsonian action at a given renormalization scale ,
but not at all  scales : this is precisely the manifestation 
at the planar level of the IR/UV problem which plagues non-planar
amplitudes renormalized according to planar renormalization.

Our theory, on the other hand, includes counterterms associated
with both planar and non-planar couplings: in the 4 dimensional
scalar case, for example, one must introduce a non-planar counterterm
associated with the  coupling. This non-planar counterterm, 
which corresponds to the term 
^4[ dp _2 (p, - p)]^2
of the effective action in Eq. (), is evidently
non-local.  We will see that such a non-local counterterm  
is essential for the UV finiteness of all the amplitudes, both 
planar and non-planar, at any  value of the
floating Polchinski cut-off : maybe surprisingly, the
non-local counterterm  ()
cancels "local" (in the non-commutative sense) 
divergences of the planar part of the effective action.
We will see an explicit example of this mechanism
in the next subsection where we compute the 2-point planar amplitude
 at 2 loops.

Of course, had we not restricted ourselves to exceptional momenta,
counterterms required to remove non-planar divergences should have had
a complicated dependence on  and the external momenta and thus
a very non-local space-time structure. Fortunately, as we explained above,
non-planar sub-divergences occurs only at exceptional momenta: it is
this that makes possible the removal of all UV divergences of 
PIS amplitudes by means of counterterms that have a simple and
"universal"  and momentum dependence: their  non-locality 
reduces to the product of the Moyal factors and
momentum delta functions associated with each hole.

divergent subgraph (b). (c) is the 1-loop correction to  
with the 1-loop  correction counterterm. (c) 
cancels non-planar sub-divergences like (b) 
Since the terms in the last two lines  of Eq. () are
 independent, UV finiteness of the coupling 
 relies on
the UV finiteness of the expression in square brackets. 
Note the following: the last (divergent) term of this expression - 
 - 
originates from the 1-loop contribution to the  counterterm. This 
term cancels non-planar sub-divergences of the 2-loop amplitude, 
like the non-planar sub-divergence of  shown in 
Figure  (b).
Had we not included the non-planar coupling  among
the marginal ones this counterterm would be absent, and, as we will
see temporarily, the amplitude () would be UV divergent
for . 
This shows explicitly that non-planar divergences  - at exceptional
momenta - also affect the UV behavior of planar amplitudes at higher loops.
To show the UV finiteness of  let us
consider the identity:
&&I^(3) _,_0 (0) -  
I^(3) __R,_0 (0)
=-3 
d k(2)^4 
__R, (k)I^(2) _,_0 (k)+

&&- I^(3) __R, - 3d k(2)^4 
d q(2)^4 
__R, (k)__R, (q)
_,_0 (k+q)
The only UV divergent term in the R.H.S. of the equation above
is the integral in the first line, which can be written as
-3 
d k(2)^4 
__R, (k)I^(2) _,_0 (k) 
= -3 I^(1) __R, I^(2) _,_0 (0)+
R (_R,,_0)
where  is finite as .
The non-planar counterterm

in Eq. () is required precisely to cancel the divergence
in Eq. ().

Note that the non-planar counterterm  vanishes at . This means that
the 2-point renormalized amplitude 
would be UV finite at   also
in a renormalization framework that did not include  
among the marginal couplings.
The fact that in such a framework the amplitudes at 
are UV finite while the Wilsonian running couplings (like 
) are not,
is the manifestation of the IR/UV difficulty
which occurs when one does not take into account
non-planar divergences. In the next Section we will generalize
this observation by showing that planar 
renormalized amplitudes of the massive theory  evaluated 
at   
do not depend on the renormalized coupling . This indeed implies
that one can compute planar amplitudes of the massive theory
at  forgetting about the non-planar marginal 
coupling . We will also show that this is not  true
for the massless theory, whose planar amplitudes at 
have an "anomalous" dependence on  - this is
how the interplay between the IR and the UV manifests
itself in our theory, which, nevertheless, is both renormalizable in 
the Wilsonian sense and completely free of IR/UV divergences.

The Parametric Equation 

We have seen that renormalization of PIS amplitudes 
requires including the non-planar coupling
 among the relevant couplings. This makes all the
amplitudes  - both the planar and the non-planar at exceptional
momenta - finite. In this Section we will show that,
although the renormalized PIS amplitudes depend
on four  relevant couplings 
- , ,  and  -
the planar  sector of the theory, at ,  
is controlled only by three  (suitable combinations) of them. Therefore, in a sense, the non-planar
coupling  can be thought of as an evanescent  coupling
of the planar theory: the corresponding counterterm is required
to make planar amplitudes UV finite at any scale , but renormalized 
planar amplitudes are at , essentially, 
independent of the renormalized value of . To be more
precise, we will see that the latter statement is literally correct
only for the massive theory. 
In the massless theory the planar renormalized amplitudes, 
evaluated at the scale , do  
depend on : however they satisfy a differential
equation of first order in the derivatives with respect to
the renormalized couplings. This implies that they are
independent of a certain combination
of  and . In all cases the planar theory has one
less marginal parameter than the full (PIS) theory.

To show this point, we will start by recalling 
that the RG evolution equation in the large  (or, in the
case of matrix theories, large ) limit
is an equation that, 
unlike the ordinary Wilson-Polchinski
RG equation,  is of first order  in the derivatives of the 
generating functional with respect to the sources :
it can therefore be written in the form
__= R[_k, 
__k ]R[_k, _, _k ]

where  is the functional of the sources and the first order derivatives
of  that appears in the R.H.S. of Eq. ().
Suppose now that the generating 
functional 
satisfies at the scale  a differential equation
of the form
E[__0^(a)  __0  ]= 0
where  is a - not necessarily linear - function of the first order 
derivatives 

of  with respect to the (bare) coupling constants  
 (with  running over the set  
). It is important that
 does not depend explicitly on the sources .
Then
_E[_ ^(a) ]
= E_ ^(a)  
__ ^(a) =
 E_ ^(a)  R_,_k  
_ ^(a) _k = R_,_k     
E_k 
This equation shows that if   for ,  identically
in . In particular, we can choose  as follows 
E = __0 _- 
(_m_0^2 _)^2
Since at the scale   by definition, it follows that 
 __0 _- 
(_m_0^2 _)^2= 0
for any . Eq. () is the analogue for PIS theory
of the celebrated factorization property of large  matrix models
(Tr  ^k)^2 =(
Tr  ^k)^2 
From the previous discussion it is apparent that factorization
is a direct consequence - in the Wilson-Polchinski framework -
of the fact that the RG evolution equation at large  or
large  is of first order in the derivatives of the
generating functional with respect to the sources.

The non-linear parametric equation () implies
the following linear equation for the generating functional
of the planar amplitudes , the part
of  linear in the sources :
[__0  - 
2_m_0^2 _^0 _m_0^2 ]_^(pl ) =0
where  is the vacuum energy density,
the part of  independent of the sources. 

We want now to translate the "bare"  equation ()
into a renormalized equation.
Let us start first with the massive theory. The renormalized
generating functional 
 depends on the renormalized couplings 
both through the bare ones and also, as far as the mass is concerned, 
explicitly via the propagators: 
_ren [^(a) ;, _R]
_,_0 [
_0^(a) (^(a) ; _R, _0); m^2]
Thus
__0^(a)   =
^(b) _0^(a)   
[_^(b)   -_b,m^2  
_m^2 ]
where  is the derivative with respect to
the explicit  dependence of the generating functional. Hence 
[(__0  - 
2_m_0^2 _^0 _m_0^2 )^(b) ]
[_^(b)   -_b,m^2  _m^2 
]_ren ^pl [^(a) ;, _R ]=0
The previous equation  simplifies at the renormalization scale
. Indeed, acting on Eq. () with the 
normalization operators  (with
), one obtains
(__0  - 
2_m_0^2 __R ^0 
_m_0^2 )N _b[__R ^pl ]=
(__0  - 
2_m_0^2 __R ^0 
_m_0^2 )^(b) = 0
for all planar couplings , i.e. for . 
Thus 
Eq. () reduces for  
to
__ren ^pl 
[^(a) ;_R, _R]=0
since 

.
The parametric equation () shows that 
planar amplitudes of the massive theory
evaluated at the renormalization scale  are
independent of the non-planar coupling . For example,
from Eq. (), one sees that 

vanishes at . The parametric equation 
() also means that if we consider
 at 
as function of the renormalized  and of
the bare  , it does not depend on .
In other words in the massive theory
one can forget about the  coupling
if one only wants to compute planar amplitudes at .

The massless case is more subtle and thus more interesting.
Because of the massless renormalization condition ()
there is one less renormalized coupling than there are bare couplings.
The renormalization conditions for ,  and 
in Eq. () 
express the renormalized couplings , where
, as functions of the bare couplings 
 and :
^() = ^() (^() _0, m_0^2;
_R, _0)
where  to regulate the infrared divergences.
The massless renormalization condition ()
determines  as function of
the bare : by substituting this latter expression
into Eq.  () one obtains the renormalized 
 as functions of the bare  :
^() =
^() (^() _0, m_0^2(^() _0;_0);
_R,_0)
From now on when writing  
we refer to the
functions of  defined in the equation above:
denoting by  their inverses, 
the renormalized functional is defined by
_ren [^() ;, _R]
_,_0 [
_0^() (^() ; _R, _0),
m_0^2(^() _0(^() ;_R,_0);_0)]
Therefore
_^()  = _0^() ^()  _0^()   + 
m_0^2^()  m_0^2 
and thus 
^() _0 
_ren ^pl ^()  = ^pl __0  + 
^() _0 m_0^2^()  ^pl _m_0^2 = 
^pl __0  + 
m_0^2_0 ^pl _m_0^2 
Using the parametric bare equation ()
we obtain
^() _0 
_ren ^pl 
^()  [,_R]=
[2_m_0^2 _^0  + 
m_0^2_0 ]
_^pl m_0^2 
To evaluate  we make 
use of the massless renormalization condition (),
which gives
m_0^2_0 = -[ N _m^2 
[_=0 ]m_0^2 ]^-1  
 N _m^2 
[_=0 ]_0 
Substituting into Eq. (), one gets
^() _0 
_ren ^pl 
^()  [,_R]= 
-_^pl m_0^2 
[ N _m^2 
[_=0 ]m_0^2 ]^-1 
[__0 - 2_m_0^2 _^0 _m_0^2 ]
N _m^2 [_=0 ]
This equation simplifies considerably
when evaluated at , since then the R.H.S.
becomes proportional to the bare parametric equation and hence vanishes:
R^() _ren ^pl 
^()  [,_R]_= 0
where   
R^()  ^() _0 
The derivative of 
 with respect to  which appear
in Eq. () can be replaced by  and 
derivatives by using the so-called counting identity. 
This identity takes the following simple form when evaluated at 
Z_Z^k _ren [0,_R] =
[k2  - 2 (g_g + _)]
^k _ren [0,_R]
where  is the
planar amplitude with  external legs.
Therefore, choosing , one can rewrite Eq.  () 
as follows
[_+_g + ]
_ren ^k [0,_R]= 0
where we introduced the generalized beta-functions
(g,) = R^(g)  - 2 g R^(Z) R^()  - 2  R^(Z)  (g,) = 12  k R^(Z) R^()  - 2  R^(Z)  
We will see in a moment that   and  get their
first non-vanishing contributions at 2 and 3 loops respectively. 
The generalized beta-functions () capture therefore 
the "anomalous" dependence
of the planar amplitudes on the non-planar renormalized coupling 
in the massless theory: this effect, as it will be apparent
from the computation that follows,  is due to an interplay between
the UV and IR divergences of the theory.

R^(Z)  = O(^3)R^()  = 1 + O()

and 
(g, ) = R^(g) _2 loops  +O(^3)
Up to order  
the  dependence of  is given by the expression
g = g_0 + 2 g_0^2  I^(2) __R, _0 (0) +
4 _0g_0^2 I^(1) __R,_0  
I^(4) __R, _0 (0) +4 m^2_0g_0^2
I^(4) __R, _0 (0) + O(g_0^3)
where
I^(4) __R, _0 (p)d k(2)^4

 as a function of 
and  at 1 loops is determined by the first of 
Eqs. () evaluated for  :
m^2_0 = -(_0 +2 g_0) I^(1) _0,_0  +O(^2)
Plugging this expression into  Eq. () one obtains for the
beta function  at two loops the following result
R^(g) _2 loops  = -4g^2 I^(1) _0,_R  
I^(4) __R, _0 (0)= - 4g^2(16^2)^2 _R^2
(1_R^2 -1_0^2 )

Let us verify the massless parametric equation ()
for the planar 4-point function  at 2 loops, the lowest order for
which the equation is non-trivial. Let us choose, just for simplicity,
the external momenta  equal to . 
The bare 4-point function becomes:
&&
^4 _,_0 (p) = g_0 + 2g_0^2
I^(2) _, _0 (p) +
4g_0^2(_0 I^(1) _,_0  +
 m^2_0)I^(4) _, _0 (p) + O(g_0^3) = 

&& =  g_0 + 2g_0^2
I^(2) _, _0 (p) -
4 _0g_0^2I^(1) _0, 
I^(4) _, _0 (p) + O(g_0^3)
where in the second line of the equation above we used the masslessness 
constraint (). Substituting now bare with renormalized 
couplings (using Eq. ()), we find that the renormalized 4-point 
function is given by the  limit of the following 
expression:
&&^4 _,_0;_R (p) = g - 2g^2( I^(2) _, _0 (p)-
I^(2) __R, _0 (0)) + 

&&4g^2(I^(1) _0, I^(4) _, _0 (p)-
I^(1) _0,_R 
I^(4) __R, _0 (0)) + O(g^3)
We thus see that the L.H.S. of the parametric equation 
(), applied to the 4-point planar function,
equals
[_+_g + ]
^4 _ren (p)[0,_R] = 
-4g^2_0 
I^(1) _0, I^(4) _,  (p)
Since
-4 g^2I^(1) _0, I^(4) _,  (p) =
g^2(16^2)^2 ^2p^2 [
(^2p^2 )-1 + O(^2p^2 )] 
the R.H.S. of the Eq. () vanishes. Note that the
 limit of Eq. () must be defined by
taking .
Conclusions 

The main message of this article is that, even at ,
renormalized non-commutative field theories do not reduce simply to
their planar sector. The genus zero RG equation couples planar amplitudes
to partially integrated non-planar amplitudes. Since the dependence of
PIS amplitudes on  factors out, these amplitudes are
essentially the same as in matrix field theory.  While the non-planar
coupling  can be introduced in a local way in  matrix
field theory at finite   - via the multi-trace operator 
 - this is not possible in the non-commutative theory
of the Moyal type, since in this kind of theories every trace must be
accompanied by integration over non-commutative space.  The
Wilson-Polchinski genus zero equation allows for a perfectly rigorous
treatment of the non-local, non-planar "bare" coupling in Eq.
() and elucidates the mechanism by which this
non-local counterterm cancels local (planar) divergences of  planar
amplitudes.

The genus zero RG equation also clarifies the standing and the
limitations of the purely planar renormalization  of
non-commutative field theories.  A distinguishing feature of the genus
zero RG equation is of being of first order in source derivatives: we
showed that this entails factorization, a well-known property of large
 matrix models. One might expect, because of
factorization, to be able to disregard the non-planar
counterterms altogether when computing planar amplitudes
in the limit  
(or, in the matrix field theory case, in the limit ). 
We showed that this is not quite so. In the massive
theory factorization implies that one can indeed remove UV divergences
of planar amplitudes using only planar counterterms, if one keeps the
floating Polchinski cut-off  equal to the renormalization
scale  that defines the renormalized couplings.  In the
usual, commutative, situation UV finiteness of
 at  would imply its
finiteness for any , since the Wilson-Polchinski RG equation
is essentially independent of the UV cut-off. In the non-commutative
case instead this is not the case: if one insists on introducing only
planar counterterms as soon as  differs from , the
UV scale  reappears in the effective planar action. The
reason, of course, is that the RG equation does not close on planar
amplitudes and the  derivative of a planar amplitudes
involves non-planar diagrams evaluated at exceptional momenta (see
Figure ), which - in planar renormalization -
are divergent. The situation for the massless theory is even more dramatic: 
planar counterterms are not enough to eliminate UV divergences even
if one sends the floating cut-off to the renormalization scale,
i.e. even in the limit . 

The restriction to partially integrated amplitudes also elucidates
the nature of non-planar contributions to non-commutative current algebra
anomalies. The non-planar part of the topological charge 
which captures the axial non-commutative anomaly appears in
the effective action as a partially integrated non-local 
term of the type in Eq. (). 
To give an example in 2 dimensions, let   be
the axial vector field to which the axial current is coupled, 
the background vector field which couples to the vector
current and  the field strength relative to . 
Then the non-planar anomaly computed in
in is reproduced by a 
term in the effective action that, written in (non-commutative) configuration
space, writes as
_0  ^2  d^2x e ^-^2 x^2 
2^2  1 ^2   _A_(x) d^2y 
^  F_ (y)
very much analogous to the partially integrated non-local term
in Eq. ().

One can think of several possible extensions of our work. 
The most challenging is the construction of a renormalized
theory of partially integrated amplitudes at higher
genus. The analysis of partially
integrated amplitudes of genus , that we present in Appendix B,
shows that these amplitudes go as  for large
 - unlike amplitudes at generic external momenta which do
not have a  limit uniform in the external momenta.
This strongly suggests that renormalized partially integrated amplitudes 
at higher genus admit a meaningful  
expansion. Attacking the renormalization problem of higher genus amplitudes
necessitates first of all working out the corresponding expansion of the 
Wilson-Polchinski RG equation. The RG evolution of higher genus partially 
integrated amplitudes involves lower genus amplitudes with non-vanishing
total momenta flowing into two of their holes: for this reason
it seems that the understanding of the higher genus non-commutative theory 
might require significantly extending the ideas presented in this paper.
It is a problem that we leave for the future.
Another issue which emerges from the present
work is the interpretation of the restriction to partially 
integrated amplitudes from string theory point of view. One might 
also consider extending our analysis to gauge non-commutative theories.

Moyal Phases for Spherical Amplitudes 

In this appendix we derive a formula for the  dependence
of generic spherical Feynman diagram integrands. 

Recall that planar diagrams depend on  via the Moyal factor
e ^-i _n(p_1,, p_n)  e ^-i_i<j  p_ip_j 
where , 
and  are the momenta associated to the  external
lines of the graph. Let us briefly review the derivation of 
Eq. () which 
exploits the following property
of planar double-line graphs: the momentum through any
propagator (or external line) in the graph can be written as
the difference  
where  and  are pseudo-momenta associated with the (oriented)
single lines that are the adjacent edges of the double-line propagator.
For any vertex with  legs, let the momenta entering the vertex
be  in cyclic
order: with respect to the commutative
theory, the Feynman rules of the Moyal non-commutative theory 
include the additional phase factor
e ^-i _k(q_1,, q_k)  = e ^-i_i<j  q_iq_j 
Writing the momenta  in terms of pseudo-momenta, 
, one obtains
_i<j  q_i q_j =
l_i_1 l_i_2  +l_i_2  l_i_3  + + l_i_n 
l_i_1 
Thus the phase factor at any interaction point may be expressed 
as the product of  terms, one for each incoming propagator
e ^-i _k(q_1,, q_k) = 
_j=1 ^k e^-i(l_i_j   l_i_j+1  ) 
Any internal propagator gives two contributions  to the total phase factor
() -  one for each of its two end vertices -  which
cancel each other.  Therefore only the external momenta contribute 
to the total phase factor, and one obtains Eq. ().

The representation of propagator momenta in
terms of pseudo-momenta is valid not only for the planar diagrams but,
more generally, also for PIS amplitudes. Therefore the very same 
argument which leads to Eq. () 
generalizes to PIS amplitudes with  holes: 
every hole with  external lines gives a
phase factor , and hence the total Moyal phase of
the amplitude is the product of  factors like in
(), one for each hole. 

Let us now turn to generic non-planar spherical diagrams with 
 holes. Let  be a label defining 
an arbitrary order of the holes.
Let , with , be the 
-th momentum entering the -th hole of the spherical amplitude.
The  momenta entering the hole have a natural cyclic order determined
by the orientation of the associated Riemann surface:
thus, defining the indices  requires choosing a particular 
(first) momentum for each hole. A spherical diagram with  loops
defines a triangulation of the sphere with  faces. We called
holes the faces
to which external lines are attached, and thus, obviously, .
We denote by , with  the independent loop momenta, 
arbitrarily chosen. The Moyal phase  
of the diagram has the general structure
(q_A, p^(a) _i_a ) = _A,B C_AB  q_Aq_B +
_a,A, i_a  D^(a) _Ai_a  q_A p^(a) _i_a  + 
_a, b, i_a, i_b 
E^(a b) _i_a i_b  p^(a) _i_a  p^(b) _i_b 
where ,  and 
 are constant coefficients.

When all the external momenta  vanish, the amplitude
becomes planar with no external lines and, thus, the Moyal phase
vanish: it follows that . Also, if all the loop
momenta  vanish, the resulting Moyal phase is
that of the  tree -
and hence planar - diagram obtained from the original diagram by 
cutting all the internal propagators associated with the momenta
. This tree diagram has the external lines of the
original diagram, with an ordering which depends on the choice
of the cut propagators, i.e. on the choice of the  independent
loop momenta . Our choice of ordering of the holes and of
the "first" momenta of each hole (implicit in the definition of
the indices  and ) induces, of course, an ordering on
the external momenta: we can always take this ordering to coincide
with the ordering of the external momenta of the tree
diagram above. In other words, the (arbitrary) definition of
the loop momenta  should be consistent with the
(arbitrary) definition of the indices  and . With this
understanding,  writes as
(0, p^(a) _i_a )=_a, b, i_a, i_b 
E^(a b) _i_a i_b  p^(a) _i_a  p^(b) _i_b  =
_a _i_a<j_a  p^(a) _i_a  p^(a) _j_a 
+ _a<b ^(a) ^(b ) 
where  is the momentum
entering the -th hole. Last, let us take all the :
the amplitude becomes PIS and thus its Moyal phase reduces to 
.
Hence the term  in () must vanish when  and
therefore it  can be expressed as linear combination of the  
_a,A, i_a  D^(a) _Ai_a  q_A p^(a) _i_a =
_a k^(a)   ^(a ) 
where  are  linear combinations of the  loop momenta .
In conclusion the Moyal phase of the diagram is
(k^(a) , p^(a) _i_a ) = 
_a _i_a<j_a  p^(a) _i_a  p^(a) _j_a 
+ _a<b ^(a) ^(b ) +
_a k^(a)   ^(a ) 
The last term in the R.H.S. of Eq. ()
gives an IR sensitive UV cut-off for the integrand of the
corresponding Feynman amplitude - the origin
of the famous IR-UV mixing effect. Because of this term, the Feynman
integral is not - for  - an analytic function
of the non-commutative parameter  at .  
As we mentioned above, PIS
amplitudes  (for which ) are precisely those that 
admit a good  limit: for them, 
the R.H.S. of Eq. () reduces to the first term,
which, thanks to momentum conservation, is now independent of
the ordering choices underlying the definition of the indices
 and . 

An explicit definition for the  loop momenta  in Eq. 
() can be
given as follows. Take the original non-planar diagram and put to zero
all the external momenta . The resulting diagram
is planar and its internal momenta admit the EK representation
in terms of pseudo-momenta , with , one
for each face of the diagram. To take into account the external
momenta consider also an auxiliary oriented 
path running through the double-line
propagators with the following properties: (i) the path
connects all the points to which the external legs are attached; (ii)
it turns clockwise around each hole starting from the arbitrary
chosen "first" leg to the "last" and going from the arbitrary chosen
"first" hole to the "last" (thus defining an ordering of the
external legs); (iii) the path together with the external legs attached
to it forms a tree diagram whose propagators carry the momenta
which  enter through the external legs. An example of such
auxiliary momentum path is depicted in Figure .

 

  
[x] A spherical non-planar 
diagram with two holes and its auxiliary momentum path 
The EK prescription for
the momentum  flowing through a given propagator is now
corrected by adding to the pseudo-momenta contribution the
momenta carried by the path, if this happens to go through
the propagator. With this definition of the internal 
the Moyal phase () of a spherical non-planar
diagram writes as
(l_a, p^(a) _i_a ) = 
_a _i_a<j_a  p^(a) _i_a  p^(a) _j_a 
+ _a<b ^(a) ^(b ) +
2_a l_a  ^(a ) 
where  with

on the differences of the pseudo-momenta .


Moyal phases for higher genus amplitudes 

In this appendix we will analyze the  dependence of non-spherical
amplitudes. 

Let us begin with the following remark: 
the Moyal phase associated with a double-line diagram
is invariant under 
topological deformations of the type depicted in Figure . 
These are deformations which vary the lengths of the double-line
propagators and correspond to changing the triangulation
of the underlying Riemann surface by keeping fixed its genus
 and its number  of faces. Note that the number of loops
 of the Feynman diagram, which is given by
L = F-1 +2g ,
is left unchanged by these deformations.


 

 
 
[x] Topological deformations preserving 
the Moyal phases 

Consider now a
diagram of genus  and  faces and join with a double-line
propagator two external legs attached to two different 
holes: one obtains in this way 
a diagram of genus  and  faces. This follows
from the Euler relation , where ,  and 
are the numbers of vertices, propagators and faces of the diagram:
the new diagram has the same number of vertices, one more
propagator and one face less than the original diagram and,
thus, one more handle. Therefore we can build diagrams
of any genus  and any number of faces  starting from
spherical (non-planar) diagrams with  faces by means
of the following construction: Consider
one such spherical diagram and join  pairs of external legs
with  propagators - choosing the legs of each pair 
to belong to different holes. In other words there should be at
most a single double-line propagator connecting any pair of holes.
An example of this construction for a genus 2 surface
built out of a spherical diagram with 3 holes and 4 external
legs is given in Figure .

An important result in the theory of Riemann surfaces states
that double-line diagrams with fixed  and  
provide a cell decomposition of the  moduli space of oriented 
Riemann surfaces of genus  and  boundaries: the moduli
of Riemann surfaces are parametrized by non-negative real numbers
associated with the lengths of the double-line propagators.
Since the moduli space of fixed genus and fixed number of boundaries
is a connected variety, it follows that
one can transform, by means of the deformations   
in Figure , any graph of genus  and  faces
into a topologically equivalent one
built out of spherical non-planar diagrams in the way 
explained in the previous paragraph.

Given two topologically equivalent diagrams, their loop 
momenta are in a one-to-one correspondence and thus can be identified:
under this identification their Moyal phases coincide. We can therefore 
limit ourselves to evaluate the Moyal phase of the higher genus diagrams
built out of spherical non-planar graphs. The Moyal phases of such
graphs are given by the formula in Eq. ()
for the associated non-planar spherical graphs  
where some of the external momenta   - those flowing into
the legs which are joined by the  propagators - become loop momenta, 
 (with ) of the higher genus diagrams. Thus we can
write the sum  of the momenta entering the -th
hole, which appears in Eq. (),
as follows:
^(a) = _i=1 ^g q_i e_i^a + P^(a) 

In the formula above  is momentum carried by the
external legs  of the higher genus diagram attached to the -th hole
of the corresponding spherical diagram;  is a 
numerical matrix whose -th element
is +1 (-1) if the momentum  enters (leaves) the -th hole and
0 otherwise.  is the incidence matrix of the
graph whose points
are the holes of the non-planar spherical diagram and whose lines
are the  propagators which connect the holes. This is a
tree  graph because any pair of holes is
 
 
[x] A genus 2 surface from a sphere with
3 holes and 4 external legs 
connected at most by a single propagator.

The Moyal phase of the higher genus diagram is therefore a
quadratic form in the loop momenta  and  which
looks as follows:
_higher-genus  = _i,j  C_ij  q_i q_j + 2 _i,a 
e_i^a l_a q_i +A
where  is a numerical matrix  and
 is at most linear in the loop momenta. 
Since 
, the Moyal phase  depends only
on the differences of the 's. In conclusion, the part of
 quadratic in the loop momenta  
can be written as  where 
 is an anti-symmetric matrix of the following form 
(D)_AB  = (0 & e_j^b-e_i^a & C_ij  )
As we said above,  is the incidence matrix of a tree 
graph with  lines and thus it has rank . It follows
that the matrix  has rank .

We are now ready to discuss the  dependence of a
generic diagram of genus . To understand the general
situation let us consider the example in Figure  of
a diagram of genus 1 and 3 loops
with 2 external legs carrying momentum  and . 
By using the Schwinger parametrization for the
propagators one obtains a Feynman amplitude which writes
as follows:
&&  d d 
d d d d g(,,, , , )

&&d^dp d^dq d^dk
e ^-[p^2+q^2+k^2+(p-q)^2+(p-k)^2+(q-k)^2 + 2 i pq + 2ikP] 

&& d d 
d d d d g(,,, , , ) 
I(,,, , , ;P) 
 
[x] A genus 1 amplitude with
3 loops and 2 external legs 
Performing the integration over the loop momenta one obtains the following
function of the Schwinger parameters
I(,,, , , ;P) =^3 d2 
(D+F^2)^d2  
e ^-P^2^2E+^2D+F^2  
where 

&& D(++)(++)
+(+)+

&& + (+)+(+)+

&& E(+)(+)+(+++)
 
&& F++
If the function  is sufficiently
regular at infinity, we can replace in Eq. ()
the integral  with its asymptotic expression for  
I(,,, , , ;P) _   ^3d2 F^d2 ^d e ^-P^2^2F  
Note the  dependence of this amplitude:
first of all there is a multiplicative factor , which 
in the general case becomes . 
The non-trivial dependence on the Schwinger parameters of
the exponential factor 
is the source of the IR-UV mixing effect: 
if the external momenta are non-exceptional, , the UV divergences
at  are regulated by the UV cut-off .
This is what makes the limit  non-uniform in the
external momenta. 

Note that when
the number  of loop momenta equals  - and thus the number
of faces of the higher genus diagram is 1 -
the matrix  in Eq. () has maximal  rank
and, thus, in this case the Moyal factor regulates all the loop integrations. 
For this special kind of diagrams the analogue of the function  
appearing in () does not vanish for any value
of the Schwinger parameters and hence there is no UV-IR mixing effect. 
For example consider the
amplitude, given in Figure , 
of genus 1, 2 loops and 2 external legs carrying momentum :
&& d d 
d f(,,) d^dp d^dq
e ^-[p^2+q^2+(p+q)^2+ 2ipq + 2ipP] 

&&= d d 
d f(,,)^d[+++^2]^d2  e ^-^2P^2(+)+++^2  
&&_  
^d^d  d d 
d f(,,)e ^-(+)P^2 
 
 
[x] A genus 1 amplitude with
2 loops and 2 external legs 

Summarizing, in the   
limit, the integrated amplitudes go as
, while the non-integrated ones
vanish exponentially. This is somewhat analogous
to what happens in  matrix field theories,
under the identification .  
In this analogy the contributions to the non-commutative
amplitudes coming from non-exceptional
external momenta correspond to
the  non-perturbative instanton effects of matrix
theory.

1PI RG equation in the planar limit 
In this appendix we derive the RG equation () satisfied
by the generating functional of spherical 1PI amplitudes of a non-commutative 
scalar field theory. The derivation is done for  matrix field
theory but the result also applies to the Moyal case.

Let  be the functional of the  matrix source 
 that generates connected amplitudes.  is related
with the generating functional of connected and amputates amplitudes
 via
F_[J] = H_[_J] + 12 N  d p 
_(p) Tr  J(p)J(- p)
and thus it satisfies the following finite  RG equation
&&_F_= 12 d p(p)
_^-2 (p)[ NTr (
F_J(p) F_J(- p) 
) 

&&+ 1N Tr 
^2 F_J(p)J(- p)  - _(p)
]
The generating functional  of 1PI amplitudes
is the Legendre transform of :
&&_^[] = 
_[] - 12 N  d p 
^-1 _(p) Tr  (p)(- p)=
 
&& =  F_[J] - 1N d p 
Tr  J(p)(- p)
where
_i j (p)= N 
F_J_j i (- p) 
By taking the  derivative of  and using 
Eq. (), one finds 
&&__= 
_F_- 12   d p (p)
^-2 _(p) Tr  (p)(- p) =

&&
= 12 d p(p)
_^-2 (p)[ 1N Tr 
^2 F_J(p)J(- p)  - _(p)
]
Let us introduce the matrices
&&(F ^(2) _)_
(i_1 j_1;p_1),(i_2 j_2;p_2) ^2 F_J_i_1 j_1 (p_1)
J_j_2 i_2 (- p_2) 

&&(G ^(2) _)_
(i_1 j_1;p_1),(i_2 j_2;p_2) ^2 ^_
_i_1 j_1 (p_1)
_j_2 i_2 (- p_2) 
whose row and column indices are given by the triples .  
Taking the  derivative of 
Eq. () and the  derivative of ()
one obtains
F ^(2) _
G ^(2) _= I 
where, here and in the following, matrix multiplication involves both a sum
over double indices  and an integral over momentum ; furthermore 
.
The result () together with () leads to the RG
evolution equation for the 1PI generating functional at finite :
&&__= 12 N^2 
T r [D  _
D _^-1 
(I - ND _G ^(2) _
)^-1 ] - 12 N^2 T r D  _D _^-1  =

&&= 12 _n=1 ^N^n-2 T r [
D  _D _^-1 
(D _G ^(2) _)^n ]
where 
(D _)_(i_1 j_1;p_1),(i_2 j_2;p_2) 
(p_1)_i_1 i_2 _j_1 j_2 (p_1-p_2)
and  denotes the trace over the triple  .

The large  limit of Eq. () is defined by taking the
invariants
_k (p_1p_k)= 1N  Tr  ((p_1)(p_k))
fixed as . Hence one has to express derivatives with respect to 
 in terms of -derivatives:
__i j (p)  =
1N _k k_k-1  d q_ 
((q_1)(q_k-1 ))_j i 
_
_k(p,q_1,,q_k-1 ) 
and
&&
^2 __i_1 j_1 (p_1)
_j_2 i_2 (- p_2)  =
1N _k_I=0 ^k-2  k
_k-2  d q_ ((q_1)(q_I))_i_2 i_1 

&&((q_I+1 )(q_k-2 ))_j_1 j_2 
_
_k(p_1,q_1,,q_I,- p_2,q_I+1 ,,q_k-2 ) +

&&+ 1N^2  _k,k^  kk^
_k-1  d q_ _k^d q^_ 
((q_1)(q_k-1 ))_j_1 i_1 

&&((q^_1)(q^_k^)_i_2 j_2 
^2 __k(p_1,q_1,,q_k-1 )
_k^ (- p_2,q^_1,,q^_k-1 ) 
The second addendum in the R.H.S. of the equation above if of sub-leading order
in  and must be discarded in the large  limit. Thus we find:
&&
N^n-2 T r (G ^(2) _)^n =  
 dP_0 dP_n-1  _i=1 ^n
[ _k_i _I_i=0 ^k_i-2  
__i=1 ^I_i  
dp^(i) __i  __i=1 ^k_i-2-I_i  
dq^(i) __i 

&&k_i __k_i (P_i-1  , C_i,
- P_i  , C^_i) ]
__i I_i  (C_n,, C_1)
 __i k_i-2-I_i  (C^_1,, C^_n)where , .
Using the identity () in the flow equation ()
we end up with the large  (or large ) RG equation for the 1PI
generating functional
&&__= 12 _n=1 ^ dP_0 dP_n-1  (P_0 )(P_1 )(P_n-1  )

&&_i=1 ^n[ _k_i _I_i=0 ^k_i-2  __i=1 ^I_i  
dp^(i) __i  __i=1 ^k_i-2-I_i  dq^(i) __i  k_i __k_i (P_i-1  , C_i,
- P_i  , C^_i) ]

&& 
__i I_i  (C_n,, C_1)
 __i k_i-2-I_i  (C^_1,, C^_n)
which coincides with Eq. () of Section 2.
