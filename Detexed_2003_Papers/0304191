 Abstract 


In this letter, we determine the particle and the 
string light cone in the pp-wave
background. The result is a deformed version of the flat one.
We point out the light cone exhibits an intriguing
periodicity in the light cone time direction  
with a period .
Our results also suggest that a quantum theory in the pp-wave background 
can be formulated consistently only if 
the background is periodic in the light cone time . 










Introduction 

Causality entered the realm of physics with the advent of special
relativity. The upper bound on the speed of any object (namely the
speed of light ) and the indefinite metric of the Minkowski
spacetime changed the idea of causality radically. One now would
speak, of events, points in spacetime. Given a present event, some
future events could be influenced by the propagation of a signal, some
others only by the propagation of a signal at the speed of light and
yet some others could not be influenced, simply because that would
require superluminal speeds.  And the idea of the light
cone emerged, defined simply as the hypersurface in spacetime that
divides causally related events from causally unrelated.
In the Minkowskian spacetime, the
light cone is defined by the proper distance  
ds^2 = -2 dx^- dx^+ + dx^i dx^i

and  divides the spacetime into regions where the proper distance
between events being time-like, light-like or space-like.

The marriage between quantum mechanics and special relativity proved to be
a non trivial one. After many attempts, this was accomplished with the
formulation of the quantum theory of fields.
The question of causality in a quantum field theory is formulated in terms
of the commutability of observables, or in terms of the
(anti-)commutability of its fundamental fields. The  light
cone in point particle quantum field theory, as defined by the vanishing of the
commutator of fundamental quantum fields,
is the same with the classical theory, 
as determined by special relativity.  


String, as an extended object, is intrinsically different from a
particle. It is an interesting problem to study the notion of
causality in string theory and to see how is it different from the
particle case. This analysis has been performed for the case of  a
flat background, with the metric flat-metric .
There, it was found
that the shape of the light cone is modified due to the extra,
internal oscillatory modes of the string. For example, two open
strings are causally unrelated (vanishing of the string
field commutator) if 
2 x^-_0 x^+ - x^i ^2_0 - _l=1 ^ x^i_l
^2 <0.  

Here  and
 for two strings  and . The
deviation from the usual understanding of light cone is obvious and is
due to the internal oscillatory modes that a string carries. This is indeed a
surprising result. Note that when the stringy contribution (
terms in flatslc ) is dropped, one
recovers the usual notion of light cone of a point particle, as
determined by the metric flat-metric .
Effects of string interaction on the definition of
light cone has also been studied. Further
discussions of the result can be found  in.

Recently, string theory in pp-wave background have been studied with
immense interests, largely due to the remarkable proposalwhich states that a sector of the SYM operators with large -charge
is dual to the IIB string theory on a pp-wave background. The string
background consists of a  plane wave background, 
ds^2 = -2 dx^+ dx^- - ^2 _i=1 ^8 (x^i)^2 dx^+
dx^+ + _i=1 ^8 dx^i dx^i,   

together with a RR five-form. 
This background can be seen as a
deformation of the flat background, with a curvature controlled by
. Remarkably, even in the presence of a RR 5-form flux, the
string theory is exactly solvable in the light
cone gauge. It is therefore an interesting question to ask whether and
how the causal structure is modified in the pp-wave case. This is the
main motivation of this letter. We find that two strings in the pp-wave
background are causally unrelated if
 
x^-_0 -  2 ( x^+
)  _i=1 ^8 _l=0 ^
[ ( (x^i_l)^2 + (y^i_l)^2 ) ( x^+ ) - 2 x^i_l y^i_l
] < 0.


The plan of this letter is as follow. In section 2 we start  with a
particle propagating in the pp-wave background and use the commutator
algebra to extract the light cone. It is given by slc-0  by
striping out all the stringy modes () contribution. 


The particle light cone is exactly the same as
the one determined by the metric pp-wave metric . 
After this warm up exercise, we
construct in section 3 the light cone string field in the pp-wave
background. We then compute the string field commutator and use it to
extract the string light cone. Discussions and further comments are
found in section 4.



Particle light cone in the  pp-wave background 

Consider a free relativistic real scalar particle moving in the metric
pp-wave metric . The light cone Hamiltonian is given by
 
H = 1 2p^+   
( p^i  2  + m^2  + ^2 x^i  2  ), := p^+   .

Notice that it consists of two parts. The first is
the usual piece for a free massive relativistic particle and the other
is an oscillator's potential.

The field for the particle has to obey the Schro ndinger equation

 i  x^+ =H ,   

In the coordinate
representation, the equation of motion reads  
i  x^+  = 
1 2p^+  ( -^2 x^i ^2  + m^2 + ^2 x^i  2  ) 
:= H_0 2p^+  .  

 is the Hamiltonian for an 
oscillator with mass 1/2 and a frequency . The light cone energy is  
 H = _i n^i + m^2 2 p^+   

where we have dropped the zero point energy. Note that the
physical mass  of the particle appears as a constant energy. We
will see below that the light cone does not depend on .

The equation eom-p  can be solved (separate variables) and at the
end, the solution one finds for the field is 

(x^+, x^-, x^i)&
= & _0^dp^+ 2p^+    _n^i  a(
p^+, n^i ) e^-i(x^+ p^- + x^- p^+)  
 & & _i=1 ^8 H_n^i ( o x^i)  [ - o(x^i)^2  ] /  2^n^i  ( n^i )!   
+ h.c. 

Demanding the equal
time commutator  
[ (x^+,x^-,x^i),(x^+,y^-,y^i)
] = (x^- - y^-) _i=1 ^8 (x^i - y^i) ,  
implies the commutation relation for the creation-annihilation
operators  
[ a(p^+,n^i), a^(q^+,m^j ) ]  = p^+ (p^+ - q^+)
_n^i,m^j   

and the other being zero.

We are now in position to find the propagator for the particle. It is
easy to obtain  

[ (x^+,x^-,x^i),(y^+,y^-,y^i)]
= I_1 -I_2  

where  is given by  

I_1 =_0^dp^+ 2  e^-i x^- p^+ - i
x^+ m^2 2p^+   _i=1 ^8 _n^i  e^-i x^+
n^i  H_n^i (o x^i) H_n^i (o y^i) e^-o(
(x^i)^2 + (y^i)^2)  )   /  2^n^i   ( n^i
! )   

and . Here ,
. With the propagator in our hands,  we are
in a position to find the light cone for the point particle.  Instead of
considering an oscillating phase factor,  the integral can be computed
by an analytical continuation of . Without loss of generality, we
assume   and we perform an analytic continuation  
p^+
i p^+ for  .  

Then  
 
I_1 &=& _0^dp^+ 2  e^x^- p^+
- x^+ m^2 2p^+    
_i=1 ^8 p^+ /  1 - e^-2ix^+     

 && 
	 p^+  2 (x^+ ) 
	[ 2 x^i y^i - ( x^i ^2 + y^i ^2 ) 	( x^+ ) ]  .  
Performing an analytic continuation  

p^+ - i p^+ for  ,  

one obtains the same identical
expression for . The integral converges in the 
 limit, and hence the commutator comm  vanishes, if the
exponent factor is negative, i.e. 

x^- -  2
(x^+)  _i=1 ^8[ ( (x^i)^2 + (y^i)^2 )
(x^+) - 2 x^i y^i ] < 0 . 
This is the equation for the point particle light cone in a pp-wave
spacetime. 

A couple of remarks are in order. First we note  
that the light cone point particle lc  is independent of the mass
 of the 
particle,  as one can expect on physical grounds. 
Secondly, we note that the particle light cone point particle lc 
is exactly the same as the light cone determined by the metric
pp-wave metric  (We thank Harald Dorn, Boris Pioline and
  Simon Ross  
for pointing out a mistaken statement 
made in the first version of this letter.) . See for interesting 
discussions of the properties of light cone and causality 
as pertained to the pp-wave metric. 
Finally, we note also that the
light cone is periodic in . We will
see that the same 
intriguing behaviour persists in the string case. 



String light cone in the pp-wave background 

The construction of a light cone string field theory in this new
background follows the same steps with the construction in the flat
background, see for example.

Consider a bosonic open string moving in a pp-wave background,  with
metric given by (). The  index enumerates the
transverse coordinates, . The generalization to
closed string and to the supersymmetric case is straightforward. By
taking a light cone gauge 
 
x^+ = p^+ , 

the theory is exactly solvable,  much like the case of  a string in a
flat, Minkowski, background. For a more detailed discussion, see
. In the light cone gauge, the string
coordinates  and the transverse ones  are given by 

x^-() = x^-_0 + ^d     x^i ' P^i( ) 

x^i() =  x^i_0 + 2  _l=1 ^x^i_l (l).
The light cone string field  depends on  ,
i.e.  and satisfies the
Schro dinger  equation 

 i  x^+ 
= H [x^+ , x_0^-, x^i ()], 

where  is the light cone
Hamiltonian (taking ) 

H =  2 p^+  _0^d[ -^2 x^i ()^2  + 1 ^2 
( x^i()  )^2 + m^2 ^2  (x^i())^2
] and  m := p^+. 
 
It is straight forward to rewrite  is terms of modes and
sch-eq1  then takes the form 

i  x^+  =
1 2p^+  _l=0 ^H_l  (x^+, x^-, x^i_l) ,

where 
H_l := -^2 x^i_l ^2  +
_l^2 (x^i_l)^2, _l :=l^2 + (p^+)^2
 . 
 

Clearly, () is
a SHO Hamiltonian with  mass 1/2 and frequency .
Eq. sft eom modes  can be solved easily and the final answer for
the string field is 

= dp^+ 2p^+  
_n^i_l  A( p^+, n^i_l ) e^-i ( x^+ p^- +
x^- p^+ )  _l=0 ^^l_n^i_l  ( x^i_l ) +
h.c. 

where 

^l_n^i_l  ( x^i_l )= _i=1 ^d-2 
H_n^i_l  ( _l  x^i_l ) e^-_l
(x^i_l )^2 / 2    _l/  2^ n^i_l  (n^i_l!)   .

The light cone energy is 

p^- = 1 p^+ 
 _i=1 ^d-2  _l=0 ^n^i_l _l, 

where we have ignored the zero point energy, which is
irrelevant for our analysis. The conjugate momentum field is given by,
see, 

[x()] =  L   
(/ x^+)   
and in the present case it
is 
= i . 
The Equal Time Commutation Relations for the string field are 
[ (x^+,x^-_0,x_l ),
(x^+,y^-_0,y_l )] = (x^-_0 - y^-_0)
_i=1 ^d-2  [ x^i() -
y^i()]. 
 

which translate to the
commutation relation 

[ A(p^+, n^i_l ), A^( q^+, m^j_k ) ] = p^+ (p^+ - q^+) _
n^i_l,m^j_k  
 
for the string
creation-annihilation operators. The calculation of the general
(non-equal time) commutator of the string field is not hard to perform
and one finds at the end that 

 [
(x^+,x^-_0,x^i_l),  (y^+,y^-_0,y^i_l)] = I_1 - I_2 ,
where  is given by 
 
I_1 &:=& _0^dp^+ 2  e^-i
x^-_0 p^+  _i _l=0 ^  _l/  
1- e^-i 2x^+ _l p^+     
 
&& 
_l 2i ( x^+ _l  p^+ 
)  [ 2 x^i_l y^i_l - ( (x^i_l)^2 + (y^i_l)^2 )
(x^+ _l p^+ ) ] 

and 
.  
Notice that as expected, the propagator
is a product of SHO propagators.

To compute  and , it is convenient to analytic continuate
 to the complex  plane. Without loss of generality, we assume 
 and perform an analytic continuation 

p^+ i
p^+ for  . 

Then 
 I_1 &=&
_0^dp^+ 2  e^x^-_0 p^+  _i _l=0 ^ 
1 - e^ - 2x^+ _l' p^+     
 &&  _l' 2 (
x^+ _l' p^+  )  [ 2 x^i_l y^i_l -
( (x^i_l)^2 + (y^i_l)^2 ) ( x^+
_l' p^+  ) ]  , 

where 
_l' =
l^2 - (p^+)^2  . 

Performing an analytic continuation 
p^+ - i p^+ for  , 

one obtains the same identical expression for .

Therefore the commutator comm  vanishes provided that the integral
I1  converges. To check when this is the case,  note that the
integral converges for . However problems may
appear in the regime . In this regime,
 becomes imaginary 

_l' = i (p^+)^2 - l^2  i p^+
Therefore I1  becomes 

I_1 
& = & _0^dp^+ 2  e^x^-_0 p^+ 
_i _l=0 ^ 
p^+/  1 - e^-2 i  x^+     
  p^+ 2 ( x^+  )  
[ 2 x^i_l y^i_l - ( (x^i_l)^2 + (y^i_l)^2 ) 
(x^+ ) ] 

 
&& ^dp^+  p^+ [x^-_0 -
 2 (x^+ )  _i,l  [
( (x^i_l)^2 + (y^i_l)^2 ) ( x^+
) - 2 x^i_l y^i_l ] ] 

The integral
converges in the  limit, and hence the
commutator comm  vanishes, if the exponent factor is negative,
i.e. if 

x^-_0 -  2 ( x^+
)  _i _l=0 ^[ ( (x^i_l)^2 + (y^i_l)^2 ) ( x^+ ) - 2 x^i_l y^i_l ] < 0. 
Equation () determines the string light cone in the pp-wave
background and is the main result of this letter.

 Notice that the string light cone slc  is determined not only by
the zero modes, but also by the internal oscillating modes of the
string. This is something that we should expect since the same phenomenon
appears in the flat background case. Keeping only the zero mode
contribution, slc  reduces to 
point particle lc  the light cone for the point particle in the same
background.

Conclusions 

We make a couple of remarks.

1.  
Unlike the flat case, the string light cone in the pp-wave
case is not a function of  any more and hence
translational invariance is lost. But this should not come as a
surprise. The pp-wave metric is not translational invariant itself,
so the same should apply to the light cone as well. This is consistent
with what we found.


2.  We note that in the limit , we recover the
flat background expression for the light cone, equation
(). This is expected since the metric (
) in the  limit reduces to the Minkowski
metric. For a nonzero  and in a small region of  such that

x^+ 1   , 
we are probing the part of
the spacetime that is  very close to the original string itself. In
this limit, spacetime curvature can be ignored. Physically one expects
that the derivation from the flat case to be small and the light
cone for the flat case flatslc  to be recovered. This is indeed
the case. The light cone slc  is a continuous function of 
and matches up with the flat case.







3. 
In this letter, we considered a free string. It would be interesting to
include interactions (tree level and loops) and to study how the string
light cone gets modified, see for a tree level
computation in the flat case.  String interaction in pp-wave
background has been considered in, and reconsidered in
where the  symmetry of the background is taken into account
properly. Field theory analysis of the  symmetry was recently
performed in. Our result agrees with the  symmetry of
the background. It will be interesting to examine this issue by including
the  invariant interaction. 


4.  Finally we note that the light cone slc  is periodic with 
. The follows from a periodicity of 
the light cone time
 x^+ x^+ + 2/.
However we did not impose any periodic
boundary condition on the metric
(Note that the if one think of the pp-wave metric 
pp-wave metric  as arised from the Pernose limit, 
then by definition
 is automatically periodic with periodicity . 
CSC thanks Rodolfo Russo for bringing this very interesting 
observation to his attention.)  to start with. 
Our result suggests that to have a consistent quantum theory on the 
pp-wave background, the background should have this periodicity periodic .
See for related works on discrete light cone quantization (DLCQ) of
string in pp-wave background.
Also we do not understand yet the physical significance of the 
periodicity of the causal structure of spacetime 
(Simon Ross suggests to us that, apart from the periodicity
interpretation,  since point particle lc 
and slc  is singular at , one may argue that
there is a relationship between pasts and futures shifted by .
See the first paper in for more detailed discussions.) .
We expect this to lead to extremely interesting physics. 
We leave these issues 
for further studies.
