Very recent CMB data of WMAP offers an opportunity to test inflation
models, in particular, the running of spectral index is quite new and
can be used to rule out some models. We show that an noncommutative spacetime
inflation model gives a good explanation of these new results. In fitting
the data, we also obtain a relationship between the noncommutative 
parameter (string scale) and the ending time of inflation.

Recent results from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe give further determination of cosmological parameters and constrain properties
of inflationary models tightly. Some analysis was done in , and in particular,
the new data on the running of the spectral index of the power spectrum of CMB
provide good constraints on inflationary models, and some models were analyzed
in . In general, models satisfying the slow roll conditions naturally
predict too small running of the spectral index. In this note we analyze
the model of  in which spacetime noncommutativity is taken into account,
and find that it is rather easy to accommodate WMAP data in this model.
It is quite remarkable that the two parameters in this model can be used
to fit four data of the spectral index. We determine these two parameters,
and the string scale is in turn determined once the termination time
of inflation is known. For a typical termination time of inflation 
 , the string scale is cm, or 
Gev.

Spacetime in general is noncommutative in string theory, this manifests in
a general relation . However it is hard to formulate
string theory in a fashion to incorporate this relation directly. On a general
ground, if inflation reflects physics at a scale close to string scale or
a related scale, one expects that spacetime uncertainty must have effects
in the CMB power spectrum, observable or to be observable. Lacking a manifest
formulation of noncommutativity, we shall be content with a scheme proposed
in , in which spacetime noncommutativity is put in by hand for a scalar
field (inflaton). Skipping the detailed discussions leading to their action,
we copy the free scalar action here
S=Vdd^3k z_k^2()(^_k_-k ^-k^2_k
_-k ), 
where
z_k^2&=a()^2y_k^2(), 
y_k^2=(_k^+_k^-)^ ,dd &=(_k^-_k^+ )^,_k^=(a^2 (+_s^2k)+a^2 (where  is the string length scale,  is the scale factor in
the metric, and time  is defined such that
ds^2=-a^-2 ()d^2+a^2()dx^2. 
Unlike in the commuting spacetime, the all important scale factor 
in our case depends on the comoving wave number . 
 
We shall consider the power-law inflation, and this can be generated by a 
scalar potential assuming an exponential form. Let  be the cosmological 
time, so , . In terms of , 
 with
_0=a_0^1n+1  (n+1)^nn+1  . 
To simplify relations that will follow, we define a scale  so that
 and .
We shall estimate the relationship between the scale  and the termination
time  later.

The scalar power spectrum can be computed in the usual way, and is given by
P(k)=k^24^2z_k^2(_k) , 
and  is determined by the condition
k^2=z_k"z_k . 
Two extremal limits were considered in , namely the UV limit and the IR
limit. However, the observed results must lie in between, so we need to calculate
the power spectrum again. The interested region is actually UV in terms of
the time when the perturbation is created, but this was not discussed in .
What we need to compute is 
n_s=1+dP(k)dk ,dn_sdk . 

Define
k_c=((n+1)^2n(2n-1) )^-n+14  (l_sl )^n-1 
l^-1 . 
Naively,  is determined by two microscopic scales  and , one would
expect that  is also at the microscopic scale. This is wrong, due to the large
exponent . To achieve sufficient number of e-folds,  ought to be large
enough, and indeed we will determine it be around 13. Thus, if  is smaller
than  by a few order, the characteristic wave length  is macroscopic.
The interesting range of  is between , and we
assume these length scales be smaller than , so . In solving
the crossing horizon condition , we will expand everything in .

Without the string spacetime uncertainty, or let , the crossing horizon
time is
_k^0=l_s^2k(kk_c )^2n-1  , 
the dependence on  is fictitious, since a factor in  cancels .
Since string uncertainty introduces a uncertainty in time ,
this ought to be smaller than the time when the perturbation is created,
namely,  must be small. This ratio is nothing but
_k^0 =(k_ck )^2n-1  1. 
For a large enough ,  is small enough so that the above assumption
will be valid.

In solving , not only we need to modify  according to , but also 
we need to modify the definition of the conformal time according to .
For instance
dd =_0^2^2nn+1  (1-nn+1 ^2
^2 )dd , 
where we have truncated to the first nontrivial order in . After a lengthy
but straightforward calculation, we find
z_k"z_k =n(2n-1)(n+1)^2 _0^4^2(n-1)n+1  
(1-2n(n+1)(2n-5)(2n-1)(n+1)^2 ^2^2 ). 
Solving  using , we obtain
_k=l_s^2k(kk_c )^2n-1  (1+n(2n-5)(n-1)(2n-1) 
(k_ck )^4n-1  ). 
The power spectrum is readily calculated to be
P(k)k^-2n-1  (1-4n^2(n-2)(2n+1)(n+1)^2(n-1)
(2n-1) (k_ck )^4n-1  ). 
Denote the coefficient in the front of  in the above formula
by  (the positive one), we compute the spectral index and the running of the index
n_s-1&=-2n-1 +4xn-1 (k_ck )^4n-1  ,dn_sdk &=-16x(n-1)^2 (k_ck )^4n-1  .  
Since  is positive,  is larger for smaller , the expected behavior.
Now, use the WMAP data
n_s&=0.930.03, dn_sdk =-0.031^+0.016 
_-0.017 
at k=0.05 Mpc ^-1 ,n_s&=1.10^+ 0.07 _-0.06 , dn_sdk =-0.042^+0.021 _-0.020 
at k=0.002 Mpc ^-1   
to see whether the main formulas in  can fit these. There are only two
parameters in , namely  and , but there are four independent
results from the WMAP. We will adopt the following strategy: we first use the
two results at  to determine the two parameters, and
make a prediction about  and its running at .
Later, we use the results about  at two different scales to make a prediction
about the running of  at the two scales.

Using the results at , we find
n=13.171^+6.198 _-2.772 ,k_c=1.65^+6.84 _-1.64 10^-5 
Mpc ^-1 . 
Indeed,  is a small number, and  is also small
enough so the approximation used in deriving  is valid.
These parameters together with  predict
n_s=1.11^+ 0.14 _-0.13 , dn_sdk =-0.089^+0.059 
_-0.100 
at k=0.002 Mpc ^-1 . 
The central value of the predicted  is quite good compared to that in
, the central value of the predicted running is larger than that in ,
but within the error bar, we notice that the tendency of the predicted
running is good, it is larger at a larger scale. For ,
it is possible that higher orders in  are not negligible, and may improve
our result.

Next, using the values of  at two different scales in , we determine
n=13.336^+5.204 _-2.412 ,k_c=1.43^+3.81 _-1.42 10^-5 
Mpc ^-1 , 
and the running of the spectral index
dn_sdk (k=0.05Mpc ^-1 )=0.030^+ 0.013 _-0.011 , 
dn_sdk (k=0.002Mpc ^-1 )=-0.085^+0.050 
_-0.065 . 

We show the spectral index and the running as functions of  in fig.1
and fig.2.

We have used the WMAP data to determine two parameters  and  in 
the noncommutative inflation model. Next, we want to determine the relation
between the ending time of inflation and the string scale. To do so, note
that the comoving wave numbers are measured at the present time, so the normalization
of the scale factor  at the present  is 1. Since the termination
of inflation, our universe underwent a radiation dominated epoch and matter
dominated epoch (for simplicity we ignore the observed dark energy), so
the scale factor was enhanced twice:
a(t_*)(10^43652460^2t_* )^ 
(13.710^910^4 )^23  =1, 
where  is the termination time of inflation and its unit is second.
Using , we find the parameter  
l=t_*n+1 (4.810^9t_* )^12n  . 
 is larger than . Next, using the definition of  in , we get
l_s=[k_cl^n((n+1)^2n(2n-1) )^n+14  
]^1n-1  . 
In the end,  and  are expressed in terms of 
l=dt_*^2n-12n  ,l_s=ct_*^2n-12n-2  , 
where in defining  and , we have turned  and  in the unit cm.

For parameters in , we have
d=1.18^+1.15 _-0.71 10^10 ,c=2.70^+0.15 _-0.35 10^8. 
Thus for s, cm, cm. 
 is larger than the Planck scale by 8 orders. 
For s, the earliest possibility , cm,
larger than the Planck scale only by two orders. For parameters in
,
d=1.14^+0.86 _-0.62 10^10 ,c=2.70^+0.21 _-0.31 10^8, 
not much different from those in .

To summarize, we have found that the noncommutative inflation model
accommodates the recent WMAP data nicely, and if this model possesses
any truth about string theory, string theory can already be tested
in the observational cosmology, this is very exciting. Although the WMAP
results on the spectral index and its running are obtained by combining
other experiments and are not yet very conclusive, we believe that 
future refined results will offer better opportunity for testing whether
spacetime uncertainty is a viable physical model for inflation.
