Abstract  The timelike boundary Liouville (TBL)
conformal field theory consisting of  a negative norm boson with
an exponential boundary interaction is considered. TBL and its
close cousin, a positive norm boson with a non-hermitian boundary
interaction, arise in the description of the  accumulation
point of  minimal models, as the worldsheet description of
open string tachyon condensation in string theory and in scaling
limits of superconductors with line defects. Bulk correlators are
shown to be exactly soluble. In contrast, due to OPE singularities
near the boundary interaction, the computation of boundary
correlators is a challenging problem which we address but do not
fully solve. Analytic continuation from the known correlators of
spatial boundary Liouville to TBL encounters an infinite
accumulation of poles and zeros. A particular contour prescription
is proposed which cancels the poles against the zeros in the
boundary correlator  of two operators of weight  and
yields a finite result.  A general relation is proposed between
two-point CFT correlators and stringy Bogolubov coefficients,
according to which the magnitude of  determines the rate of
open string pair creation during tachyon condensation. The rate so
obtained agrees at large  with a minisuperspace analysis of
previous work. It is suggested that the mathematical ambiguity
arising in the prescription for analytic continuation of the
correlators corresponds to the physical ambiguity in the choice of
open string modes and vacua in a time dependent background. 
 
Introduction 

In this paper we study the two-dimensional conformal field theory
described by a  negative norm
boson with an exponential interaction on the boundary. The action
is
S_TBL =-12   _ 
X X
  +2  _    e^X .  
We will refer to this as the TBL (timelike boundary Liouville)
theory. Due to the 'wrong' sign in front of the kinetic term in
, the  correlator on the upper half plane isHere and in
the rest of the paper we have set . 
X(z,z)X(w, w)=  z-w+
z-w,  and the boundary interaction is marginal. This
wrong sign also implies that the functional integral D  Xe^-S_TBL    is not well-defined. In order to define
the theory, we will need to specify some kind of analytic
continuation procedure.

TBL has not been previously studied in much detail. A
minisuperspace analysis appeared in . Certain
bulk one-point functions were recently computed in
.   However it is a close cousin of several
theories which have been well-studied. Analytically continuing 
 we obtain a free positive-norm boson with a non-hermitian
boundary interaction , 
S_NH =12   _ 
  +2  _    e^i .  
This can be viewed as 'half' the boundary Sine-Gordon theory
(with a marginal boundary interaction)
,, , which has a   
 boundary interaction. The correlators of
TBL are hence formally related to those following from .
However since  has a non-hermitian interaction, its
correlators are also not unambiguously defined.

Generalizing the coefficient of the exponent in , and
improving the stress tensor so that the interaction remains
marginal, we obtain the ordinary spacelike boundary Liouville
(SBL) theory S_SBL =12   _ 
  +2  _    e^b .  
This theory has been studied for generic real values of . The
two-point boundary correlators have been explicitly obtained in
, , the bulk-boundary correlators are in
, an integral form of the three-point boundary
correlators has been given  in , and supersymmetric
correlators are in . We shall see that the analytic
continuation  from   to   and
  is highly non-trivial and encounters ambiguities
for boundary correlators. This difficulty has been encountered
previously while studying the role of  in the 
accumulation point of minimal models ,  . In
this paper we will give a specific, physically-motivated (in the
context of string theory) proposal for continuing the two-point
boundary correlator to TBL. The prescription involves approaching
the TBL theory through  theories with a linear dilaton.

Yet another related theory is the timelike
boundary Sine-Gordon theory
S_TBSG =-12   _ 
X X
  +_  (_-e^-X +  _+e^X ).  
The boundary state for this theory was found  by analytic
continuation from the spacelike case in , , in the
context of 
string theory, where some cases describe an s-brane . Aspects
of closed string emission were computed in
,,, . We expect the boundary
correlators for this theory, which have not been computed,  to be
more intricate due to the extra interaction term.  A further
complication is that there is no "free" region at 
in which the (open string) spectrum can be easily understood.
However the extra interaction term could also simplify matters by
controlling divergences and leading to a hermitian action for
. We will not consider this interesting theory
further in the present paper.A minisuperspace analysis will
appear in . 





The theories described by the actions   and  are
of interest in a number of contexts. In string theory  is
the worldsheet action describing time-dependent  open string
tachyon condensation ,,  .  This can
equivalently be viewed as unstable D-brane decay or the future
half of an s-brane.  This relation will be further discussed in
section 2. Non-hermitian boundary interactions of the general
variety   are realized in a variety of condensed
matter systems .   itself arises in the infrared
limit of a 2d superconductor with a magnetic field and a line
defect which are not parallel . The non-hermiticity
corresponds to a lack of reflection symmetry across the defect.
Finally  is related to the  theory obtained as the
accumulation point of the  unitary boundary minimal models,
all of which it in a sense contains ,  . This
highlights the
non-trivial nature of this CFT.


As noted above, the TBL theory is not well-defined without some
kind of additional prescription. This prescription should be
dictated by, and may depend on,  the physical context in which the
theory arises. In the context of string theory, we shall argue
that the two-point correlator gives stringy Bogolubov coefficients
describing quantum open string creation during tachyon
condensation. The creation rate depends only on the magnitude of
the two-point function, which was computed in the minisuperspace
approximation to TBL in . We find that a natural
 prescription for defining the TBL two-point correlators
by analytic continuation gives a result in agreement with the
minisuperspace approximation at high energies. This connection
further suggests that the mathematical ambiguity in the correlator
corresponds physically to the ambiguity in the choice of a vacuum
state and modes for open strings during the time-dependent process
of tachyon condensation.It would be interesting to
understand the physical origin/resolution of these ambiguities in
the superconductor context , where to date largely bulk
quantities have been considered. 

We wish to stress that we regard this work as a preliminary step
in defining the TBL CFT.  We have not given a procedure for
defining the boundary three-point function (known only in integral
form for the spacelike case), or verified that our prescription
yields correlators obeying the properties of a CFT. Indeed since
the TBL theory is not unitary it is not clear what those
properties should be. Further, we feel there is some hidden
"meaning" in the (accumulation of) singularities which we have not
fathomed.  We regard all of these as interesting problems for
future investigation. Since tachyon condensation is an allowed
process in string theory we believe that, despite the apparently
singular behavior of the TBL theory, a well-defined set of
correlators should exist.

An intriguing feature of our continuation prescription to TBL is
the following. As mentioned above, an intermediate step involves
 timelike linear dilaton theories, which are of interest in
their own right. The proposed prescription determines the norm of
the boundary correlator  for all real values of the
dilaton. Interestingly, as detailed in section 4.2, the  phase
 is determined only for 'rational' values of
the dilaton, and does not have a smooth extension to real values.

This paper is organized as follows. In section 2.1 the
minisuperspace analysis of TBL in the context of string theory is
reviewed. While the validity of the minisuperspace analysis is not
a priori obvious, it gives us invaluable clues as to which
operators to consider and what kind of phenomena to expect. In
section 2.2 a general relation between CFT two-point functions and
stringy Bogolubov coefficients is proposed. Section 3 describes
the computation of correlators of bulk operators, and explicitly
works out the one and two-point functions as well as the boundary
state. In section 4.1 we review the crucial results of 
on the boundary two-point function for ordinary boundary Liouville
theory which has a spacelike boson. Finally in 4.2 we detail our
proposal for continuing this two-point function to TBL. This
involves contours for analytic continuation of the background
charge (i.e. a timelike linear dilaton) and , as well as a
prescription to sum a certain series of residues after the
analytic continuation. The final result for the magnitude gives
agreement at high energies with the minisuperspace computation of
the open string creation rate. Properties of some special
functions appearing in the expressions for correlators are given
in an appendix.
TBL and String Theory 

  TBL is the worldsheet description of a time dependent process
in which the open string tachyon field  starts
at its unstable minimum in the infinite pastIn classical
string theory the tachyon can be perched indefinitely at its
unstable minimum without being pushed off by quantum
fluctuations.   and then rolls to an infinite value
in the far future . Such processes have been
discussed in , ,  .  This may equivalently be
described as the decay of an unstable brane or the future half of
an s-brane (which consists of creation of an unstable brane
followed by its decay).

Minisuperspace Review 
  The minisuperspace approximation to TBL was described in  and will be
reviewed in this subsection. While the validity of this
approximation is not a priori obvious, it nevertheless provides
invaluable clues as to what to look for in the exact treatment.

The  constraint on the open string worldsheet for a half
s-brane becomes a Schrodinger equation for the open string wave
functions In our conventions . 
( ^2 X^2   +e^X  +N-1
 +p^2 )(X)=0.  Here we abbreviate the timelike
coordinate  as ,  is the spatial momentum and  
is  the oscillator level number. The solutions to this are Bessel
functions ^in _p  = ^io  2o (1-2io) e^ip x  J_-2i
o(2 e^X/2 ),    N-1+p^2  
and their complex conjugates. In the far past this solution
approaches a positive frequency plane wave X-,      _p ^in 1 2o e^-ioX+ip x  .  In the far future ,
_p ^in  ^i (1-2io)8o  e^- X/4+ip x 
(e^o-2i e^X/2 +i  4  
+e^-o+2i e^X/2 -i  4    ) . 
We see that the incoming modes  contain both
negative and positive frequency parts in the far future. This
indicates open string pair creation. Normalized outgoing positive
frequency modes are Hankel functions _p ^out 
= 2 i e^-o +ip x 
H_-2io^(2) (2 e^X/2    ) ^-1/4 
2  e^-X 4 -2i e^X/2 +ip
x ,    X .  The in and out modes are related
by the Bogolubov transformation _p ^out &=_p  ^in _p  +_p ^in* _-p ,_p ^in &=_p ^*
^out _p  -_p ^out* _-p , _p &=  ^-io  4 i o   (1+2i)e^o, _p  &=- ^io4 i o  (1-2i)e^-   .   which obey 
 as required.
Expanding p  (^in _p 
a^in _p  +^in* _p  a_p ^in )=_p  (^out _p 
a^out _p  +^out* _p  a_p ^out ),  the in vacuum becomes
in>=_p  (1-^in _o^2)^1/4 
e^-^in _o (a_p ^out )^2 out>, 
where ^in _o=_p ^* _p  = -ie^-2o,  where  and  are
related by . The in vacuum is annihilated by 

 Relation  expresses the fact that if there
are no incoming particles at , there will
necessarily be outgoing particles at .   and
 can be changed by phase redefinitions of the modes, but
the total string creation for a mode with frequency  is
characterized by . Similarly the out vacuum
is an excited state of the in vacuum out>=_p 
(1-^out _o^2)^1/4  e^-^out _o
(a_p ^in )^2 in>,  where
^out __p ^* ^*_p   = ^-2io (1+2i) (1-2i) 
e^-2o.  The magnitude of this result will be reproduced for
large   in our CFT analysis of TBL.







Two-Point Function as Stringy Bogolubov Coefficient 

  We would like to improve on the minisuperspace analysis
and obtain exact CFT results. Our first order of business is
to understand what correlator or other quantity in the CFT
determines the open string production rate.
   In order to understand this, we first review certain aspects
of the spacelike boundary Liouville (SBL) theory with action
. Quantum states can be described as an incoming wave 
 from the free region  which reflects off
the exponential  potential and returns as an
outgoing wave , where the reflection
coefficient  is a phase. The state then has the zero mode
dependence
 in the free region
-  ,      _p() e^-ip
 +R_b(-ip)e^ip  .  Under the barrier, roughly speaking the
WKB wave function (for normalizable states) dies exponentially as
, though of course the
theory is strongly coupled in this region so that statement is
heuristic. According to the operator state correspondence,
the reflection coefficient is given by
R_b(-ip)=d_b(Q 2 -ip) 
where  and the two-point boundary
correlator on the upper half plane is d_b()=<e^ e^ >_SBL ,  where the insertions are at  and .
This is illustrated in figure 1a.

(a) reflection amplitude for spacelike boundary Liouville
 and (b) analytically continued amplitude for TBL. figure3.eps 5.0truein 

Let us now consider analytic continuation  from SBL
to TBL, so that  is now a timelike target space coordinate, and
, as shown in figure 1b.
There is also an analytic continuation of the
screening charge such that  which will be detailed below.
Then in the free region , and the wave
function behaves asSince  we need not distinguish between
 and  here.  X - ,     _o(  X) e^-ioX +d_i()e^ioX ,  where the appropriately continued
reflection coefficient d_i()=<e^-ioX e^-ioX >_TBL  
is no longer necessarily a pure phase.
 In the strong coupling region, the
potential is now negative relative to the kinetic term, and the
wave function behaves as  
 (as indicated  in the minisuperspace result ). In
the spacelike case, there are also two possible exponential
behaviors (growth and decay) but normalizability singles out the
decaying mode. Hence analytic continuation from SBL to TBL yields
a wave function with only one of the two asymptotic behaviors, as
opposed to a general admixture. Let us choose our prescription so
that this is the positive frequency outgoing wave. Then we
may interpret  as the linear combination of incoming waves
that produces a purely positive frequency outgoing wave. Comparing
with  we then see that the two-point function is a ratio of
Bogolubov coefficients d_i()=_o_o.  The string pair
production rate is determined by the magnitude of . 
In the minisuperspace approximation



d_i()=e^-2o. 

There is another way of understanding the relation .
Mathematically, correlators in TBL are not unique because one must
specify an analytic continuation procedure. Physically they are
not unique because one must specify the vacuum state in a
time-dependent background. As discussed above, 
analytic continuation from SBL to TBL
most naturally gives correlators in the out vacuum. The out vacuum
is  represented as an excited state of the in vacuum in
expression . One then easily finds that, in this state,
 the minisuperspace S-matrix for scattering  two incoming strings to
 zero outgoing
strings is given by
 -_^out * =_o_o=d_i().  Hence one may interpret the two
point function  as giving this S-matrix element.


It is natural to conjecture that this relationship extends beyond
the example discussed here. More generally we expect that the disk or sphere
two-point function
for open or closed strings in a time dependent background gives the
stringy Bogolubov coefficients.


Now we turn to computation of the CFT correlators.





Bulk Correlators 

The TBL theory is a  boundary deformation of a free timelike boson
on the upper half plane
S_TBL =-12   _ 
X
X
  +2  _   e^X   
A correlator involving  closed string vertices and  open
string vertices is formally given by the path integral
A&=_i=1 ^n e^_iX(z_i,z_i)  _j=1 ^m e^_j X(x_j) &= DX
e^-S  _i=1 ^n e^_iX(z_i,z_i)  _j=1 ^m
e^_j X(x_j),    where  is a point on the real axis.
Following , we decompose  where  is the
zero mode of . Then the  integral can be done exactly,
yielding A= (-s) (2 )^s
_i=1 ^n e^_iX(z_i,z_i) 
_j=1 ^m e^_j X(x_j)  ( dy e^X(y) )^s_Free ,   where 
. For integer ,  has a simple
pole and the residue is given by the integral over  the nonzero
modes, which can be evaluated using the free field correlation
function on the half plane with Neumann boundary conditions.
(A useful reference for the resulting integrals is ).The
general correlator is then obtained by analytic continuation in
. However, since the residues can be perturbatively evaluated
only for integer , and analytic continuation from the integers
in not unique, the final answer must be checked using various
consistency conditions such as factorization, crossing symmetry, etc.
   This technique was
used in the calculation of the three point function for the bulk
Liouville theory .

This procedure however is a bit problematic for open string
correlators because of singularities when the boundary operator
and interaction insertions coincide. A prescription must be
specified for dealing with these correlators. Ultimately we
believe that this corresponds to the ambiguity in the choice of
open string vacuum, to which closed string correlators on the disk
are insensitive.

Rather than directly computing the integrals in , bulk
correlators of the form  may alternately be evaluated using
contour deformation.  TBL has a level
one SU(2) current algebra generated by In our conventions

,   and . 
j_(z) =e^X(z) ,      j_3(z)=1 2 X(z) ,  which obey
j_-(z)j_+(w)&1 (z-w)^2 -2j_3(w)
(z-w) ,j_3(z)j_(w)&j_(w) (z-w) ,   Note however that in the
standard norm for a timelike boson ,
 is anti-hermitian while  are both
hermitian. Nevertheless the charges J_dz
2i  j_(z),       J_3=dz 2i  j_3(z),
  obey the usual commutation relations
[J_-,J_+]=-2J_3,      [J_3,J_]=J_  and are
therefore useful for computing correlators. To exploit this we
note that the TBL boundary interaction is simply
2  _  de^X 
=i J^+.  Correlators may then be evaluated by e.g.
deforming the  contour into the upper half plane and letting
it act on the operator insertions as in .Life is
not so simple with boundary insertions because one must specify
the contour prescription near the boundary operator insertion. 

One-Point Function 
In this section we
calculate the one-point function of the closed string vertex operator 

inserted at the center of a unit disk. Because of momentum conservation the
perturbative contribution is
given by the insertion of  Liouville boundary interaction terms.
e^- n X (z,z)_TBL  &= (2 )^n e^- n X (z,z)
_i=1 ^n dx_i e^X (x_i)&= (2 )^n  z-
z^n^22  _i=1 ^n dx_i
_i<j x_i-x_j^2 _i=1 ^n z-x_i^-n z-x_i^-n 
&= (2 )^n   z-
z^-n^22   _i=1 ^s du_iu_i  _i<j ^s u_i-u_j^2 &=
 z-
z^-n^22   (2 )^n (2)^n
(n+1).  
Where is the third line the upper half plane was mapped to the disk, which
mapped the integrations to the well known Dyson-gas form. The perturbative
result  can now be used to determine the general form of the bulk
one-point function by analytical continuation using .
e^X (z,z)_TBL &= z-
z^-2h_ ()^-  (
)(1-)&=  z-
z^-2h_ ()^-   .   
The one-point function  can now be analytically continued
via , giving 
e^-iX (z,z)_TBL  = z-
z^-2h_ ()^i  i
 1  . 

Boundary States  The collection of all bulk one-point
functions can be represented by a boundary state. The boundary
state  for the boundary Sine-Gordon theory
S=12   _    +12  _   ( e^i +  e^-i ) 
was found using the bulk  current algebra in (see
  also , ,,  ). For a
noncompact boson one has (up to normalization)
 B_BSG =
_j _m=-j ^j D^j_m,-m  (
  g(,)) j;m,m. 
Here  is the Ishibashi state associated with
the  primary field .    is
the spin  representation of the  rotation given
by
g(,) = e^i(J_++  J_-) =()&
  i  ()   i() &( )  . 
Reality of the boundary interaction demands that  and
 are complex conjugates. Sen ,  observed that
an analytic
continuation  produces an exact time dependent open
string background.


It was pointed out in  (and at intermediate stages of
the calculations in ) that the boundary states can also
be constructed for , and in particular we can set
 to obtain the non-hermitian theory
whose action  is in .
The unitary rotation matrix   becomes
a raising operator. The boundary state becomes simply
B_NH  = _j _m0 ^j
  j+m2m  (i)^2m  j; m,m. 
Inspection of the  currents  of TBL theory reveals that
under ,  and hence 

. Therefore we may also write
B_TBL  = _j _m0 ^j
  j+m2m  (i)^2m  j; m,m. 

Following a related discussion in , the component of the
boundary state  which does not contain
any oscillator modes can be obtained by setting :
As in  there are extra phases  appearing
  in   which can be fixed by demanding that the
   state corresponds to an array of D0-branes. 
B_0 &= _j  (i)^2j 
    j; j,j&= _n=0 ^(-)^n e^nq 0&= 11+e^q   0.  
This result agrees with the appropriate limit of the more general boundary
state found in .
Although every term in the second line of  diverges at late
times the resummed expression is well behaved, in particular there
exists a Fourier transform which gives the closed string one-point function
e^2iX  Bconst (  )^2 i  1(2 ) , 
in agreement with .

N-Point Correlators  Perturbative correlation functions
involving only bulk vertex operators can be easily evaluated using
contour deformation techniques. For example the two-point function
is A_2(j_1,j_2)&=e^-2j_1
X (z_1,z_1) e^-2j_2 X (z_2,z_2)_TBL  &=
(2i)^2(j_1+j_2) (2 )^2(j_1+j_2) 
1(2(j_1+j_2))! &e^-j_1 X (z_1) e^-j_1
X (z_1) e^-j_2 X (z_2) e^-j_2 X (z_2)
_i=1 ^2(j_1+j_2) dx_i2i  e^X(x_i)&=(2i)^2(j_1+j_2) (2 )^2(j_1+j_2) e^-j_1 X (z_1) e^+j_1 X (z_1)
e^-j_2 X (z_2) e^+j_2 X (z_2)&= (2i)^2(j_1+j_2) (2 )^2(j_1+j_2) 
z_1-z_1^-j_1^22    z_2-z_2^-j_2^22  
z_1-z_2^j_1j_2  z_1-z_2 ^-j_1j_2 .    In the
second line the bulk vertex operators on the half plane where
split into holomorphic and antiholomorphic parts on the plane
using the doubling trick. Then the  contours along the real axis
were pulled off the lower half plane and the  algebra 
was used to turn  into 
. Note that all combinatorial factors cancel in the end. 
It is straightforward
to generalize the contour deformation techniques to evaluate bulk
N-point functions. Hence as far as the bulk correlation functions are
concerned the TBL theory is very simple. We shall
see that this is not the case for correlation functions involving
boundary vertex operators.


Boundary Correlators 

As mentioned above, the simple methods for computing bulk
correlators encounter ambiguous singularities when applied to
boundary correlators. In this section we will define the two-point
correlator by analytic continuation from known expressions for the
two-point correlator of the spatial boundary Liouville theory
,  .  We shall see that even this
procedure is ambiguous: an infinite number of pairs of poles and
singularities accumulate at precisely the point we wish to
continue to.  We will adopt a simple (but not obviously unique)
prescription in which these poles and singularities cancel one
another and a finite answer is obtained for the two-point
correlator.

Spacelike Boundary Liouville  Spacelike boundary Liouville
theory can be defined by the following action on the half plane:
S_SBL = 12 _  (+ e^2b  ) + 2 _ 
e^b .  Here  and  are the bulk and boundary
cosmological constants respectively. The Liouville coupling
constant  determines the background charge  and
the central charge  of the theory. Boundary vertex
operators  have conformal dimension .
There are two important quantities calculated by Fateev,
Zamolodchikov and Zamolodchikov  (see also ).
Firstly the bulk one-point function
U()&=(z-z)^2h_  e^2X (z, z) &= 2b  ((b^2) )^Q-22b (
2b2b -1b^2 -1)((
Q-2)s),   where .
Secondly the  boundary two-point function e^_1 (x)  e^_2(0)  1x^2
h_o (
  (Q-_1-_2) +
  (_1-_2) d()), 
where  d()= ( (b^2)
  b^2-2b^2 )^Q-22b  G_b( Q-2)  G_b(21S_b(+is)S_b(Here  and  are special functions defined in 
and  related to the Barnes
  double Gamma function  (see Appendix A  for a collection
  of  useful formulae). The parameter  is related to the
  coupling constants in 
  of the theory in the following way
^2(b s)= ^2 4  (b^2). 

Our current interest is the case for which the bulk cosmological
constant is turned off. From  it follows that as 
 one has to take . _s 
U()= 1b  (  (1-b^2) )^Q-2b (
2b2b -1b^2 -1).   Using
 and A.11 the two-point function has the limitThis formula
appears in , but apparently with a different power of 2 in the 
normalization. 
_s  d()d_b()= (
 b^1-b^2 (1-b^2) )^Q-2b 
G_b(Q-2)G_b( 21 S_b()^2 .  The SBL theory
with interaction  can (at least formally) be related to
the TBL theory with interaction  by taking  while
. Note that in this limit ,  and one
gets a free boson with vanishing background charge. Furthermore
perturbative correlation functions are clearly identical for the
two theories.

For the bulk one-point function  one finds
_bi _s  U() = ( )^2i  1(2) ,  which (up to
normalization) agrees with 
for .


Analytic Continuation to Timelike Boundary Liouville 

We wish to obtain the TBL two-point function from the SBL two
point function  by the analytic continuation 
e^-ioX e^-i oX _TBL e^o e^ o _SBL, b=i =d_i().  This however is not
as straightforward as it sounds. As seen in the appendix, the
special functions  and  appearing in  have
poles and/or zeros at  for integer  and .
If we take  from the real axis along the unit circle
these poles/zeros are at , and
an infinite number of them accumulate at every integer multiple of
.This singularity may be related to the accumulation of
boundary minimal models at  , .  For this reason
 is not defined for  .

However it turns out that if we look at the particular ratio of
special functions appearing in  , we shall see
that the poles and singularities accumulate in pairs and can be
arranged to cancel for real . This will enable us to give a
prescription defining . Using recursion and  product relations
from the appendix, the ratio of special functions appearing in
 is G_b(Q-2)G_b( 21
S_b()^2 &= G_b(Q-2)G_b(2  G_b()^2G_b(Q-)^2 &=Y_b()b^ 2b - 2b1  b^2 +b^2    (2b -1b^2 ) (2ob -1
  -b^2)(-2b  +1) (-2 ob)^2(
  -b +1) ^2(-b ) ,   
where
Y_b()G_b(-2)G_b(2) 
  G_b()^2G_b(-)^2 . 
 Using the product representation
A.10 one has simply  Y()&=
_m=0 ^  _n=0 ^ (2+-2o  + )(-+o+ )^2 . 
where . It can be seen that
the product is absolutely convergent for generic complex .


We now wish to understand the behavior of this correlator
for . We will take  by first going to the imaginary axis,
so that  and  with  real,
and then taking . Physically this corresponds to adding a
real timelike linear dilaton which alters the growth of the tachyon.
For pure imaginary ,  is also pure imaginary, and
(for real ) the
factors in  appear in complex conjugate pairs. Hence for this case 
 is formally a pure phase. In order to make a more precise statement
and determine the phase we now introduce
the integral form of the special functions.

In  one finds the integral representation S_b(x)=_0^ dt t [(Q-2x)t (bt) (t/ b) +2x-Q t ].  We take 
 and  with  real, which implies
convergence of . Other values of the parameters will be
obtained by analytic continuation. By deforming the integration
contour,  may be rewritten S_b(x)= I_b (x)
+_b(x).  as the sum of an integral  over the
positive imaginary axis plus a sum  of simple pole
residues at .We might also have
deformed to the negative imaginary axis which would have picked up
the poles at  and changed the results below by the
replacement . One possibility is to take half
the sum of the two contours which would manifestly preserve the
 symmetry. However there is no change in the
final  formulae for , which is our main interest here, so we
will not further explore these alternate prescriptions. In
the appendix of  it was suggested that the residue sum
might be dropped in determining the correlators. That leads to 
correlators which are pure phases of constant magnitude.   (The
contribution from the quarter-circle at infinity vanishes.)
Defining  the integral is I_b (x)=i 2 _0^ d  [((2x-Q)) (b ) (/ b) +Q-2x  ].  For  with
 real and positive, this reduces to the convergent
expression I_i (x)=i 2 _0^ d
 [((2x-Q)) () (/)  +Q-2x  ].   For 
, this further reduces to I_i (x)=i 2 _0^ d  [(2x) ^2()  -2x  ],  which contributes a pure
phase to . The sum over pole residues is
_b(x) &=_n=1 ^ (-)^n( n (Q-2x) b ) n (n
b^2 ) &=_n=1 ^  1 n  [
( 2nx b ) -( nb^2 )( 2n x b ) ].   In
order to take  in this expression, we define
1b^2 = -1 ^2 +i ,     
x=-iby,  where  is real. For  on the imaginary axis,
reality of  and reality of  are the same thing. Keeping 
rather than  real for  off the imaginary axis simplifies the
calculations.  The real part of the sum  is then
 Re  [_i, ]=_n=1 ^  1 n [
(2 n y) +(2n y )Im [(n^2 -ni)] ].  We wish to take 
 with  fixed, which takes us outside the radius of
convergence of . The problematic terms for small 
are the ones that behave as  () for
positive (negative) , ie. the first (second) term in the
expression Re 
[_i, ]=_n=1 ^  e^2ny  2n [ 1+Im [(n^2 -ni)]]
 + _n=1 ^  e^-2ny  2n [ 1-Im [(n^2 -ni)]
].  When , we  will define the first (second)
term for positive (negative) real  by analytic continuation
from negative (positive) real . The resulting expression is
related by analytic continuation to those obtained in the
 region where the sum is convergent.

The dangerous-looking term in  expression  for 
 can be rewritten  Im [(n^2 -ni)]=12  (2n) ^2 (n)+ ^2 (n^2 ) .  To
define the limit we must take  irrational so that 
 is nonzero for every  . In that case,
the  dominates over the 
 term for . Because of the
  in the numerator
every term in the sum vanishes for  and hence
 _0  Im [(n^2 -ni)]=0. 
 This leaves us with for 
Re [_i ]=_n=1 ^  e^2ny 
2n  +_n=1 ^  e^-2ny  2n .  Using
analytic continuation in  to define the sums, and restoring
 gives Re [_i ]=- [ 2 (x  )]. 

 Although derived for irrational , this result
can obviously be smoothly extended back to the reals. For 
, the integral  is real, and  is the only real
part of . This then yields for Re [S_i (x)]=-[2 (x )]. 


Now we consider the imaginary part of the sum. Here it is useful
to consider  rational (with coprime).
The imaginary part is then Im   [
_i, ]=-_n=1 ^  1 n  (2n y )Re [(np q -ni)],  where
 Re [(np q -ni)]=12  (2npq ) ^2 (n)+ ^2
(npq ) .  Now we find that the terms with  a
multiple of  vanish, while the remaining terms are bounded but
typically nonvanishing for . The sum is then for
 Im   [_i ]=-_n mq ^  1 n  (2n y) (np q ).  Again we will define the  terms by analytic
continuation from negative  but for the sake of brevity we will
not bother to separate the two types of terms. Writing ,
with ,  may be rewritten
Im  [_i ]&=-
_n_0=1 ^q-1 _m=0 ^  ( 2(mq+n_0)x  )mq+n_0  (n_0p q ) &=^x  _-x    dy e^-2q y -1  _n_0=1 ^q-1  (n_0p q )e^-2n_0y  .   The integral has an unilluminating
expression in terms of hypergeometric
 functions.
Note that for the case of current interest ,  and
 trivially vanishes.  is a finite expression which
(together with ) defines the phase of  for real 
and  on the imaginary axis. It is a smooth function of  for
any rational . It is easy to see howeverFor example
 for large  does not approach . , that it is not
a smooth function of : it varies chaotically over the
rationals, and has no obvious extension to the reals.


Now let us consider the product  appearing in . This can
be written in terms of  as
 Y_b()=S_b(2) S_b^2() b2  ^2(1-ob )^2(-b)(1-2ob )(-2b) .  It
then follows from ,  and  that
Y_i()=-e^i() ,  which is a pure phase in
agreement with the naive expectation from the product formula
. The phase is determined by  as  I_i(2)+2iI_i()= 1 2 _0^  d  (4 o)-2(2)  ^2()  . 
Hence, our continuation prescription yields  d_i() =
()^2i e^i () 4
  ^2()  . 
This agrees asymptotically for large  with the minisuperspace
result for the string creation rate .


It is interesting to consider the results of taking other contours
from  to . Consider for example taking 
along the arc  for ,
which has real . In this case the phase of  is
smooth (in fact it vanishes) but the magnitude fluctuates wildly
as a function of  for . This can
be seen from the recursion relationPhysically the recursion
formulae are derived by considering insertions of degenerate
operators.  Y_b (+Q)&= 4 (+Q)o(-2b)^2(-b(+Q)) (-2b(+Q))^2(-b) ^2  (b)b (2+Q)^2 Y_b ().   For , , and
this reduces to Y_i(o+0)=16 ^4()Y_i(). 
Hence along this contour the two-point function does not smoothly
approach , in accord with the general expectation that
correlators at  will depend on a contour prescription.

A Properties of special functions 
The special function  was defined in 
(see also ). It obeys the recursion relations
G_b(x+b)=(2)^-12   b^-bx+12  
(bx)G_b(x),G_b(x+1b )=(2)^-12  
b^xb -12  (xb )G_b(x).  
There exists an integral representation for , which is valid
for ,
G_b(x)= _0^dtt  ( e^-Qt2  -e^-xt (1-e^-bt )(1-e^-tb  )  +(Q2  -x)^2
2 e^-t  +Q2 -xt ). 
Another useful special function is defined by  
and  satisfies the recursion relations
S_b(x+b)&= 2 (b x)S_b(x),S_b(x+1b  )&= 2 (xb )S_b(x),S_b(x+Q)&=-4
 (b x) (xb )S_b(x),    
as well as
S_b(x)S_b(-x)=-1 4 (b x )(xb ) . 
Since  one can easily show by applying  twice
that
G_b(x+Q)&= b^xb - bx+1 2  (x    b +1)( b x) G_b(x),G_b(x-Q)&= b^-xb + bx+1b^2 -b^2 -1  2(x    b -1b^2 )( b x-1-b^2)  G_b(x).   

 is related to a the
Barnes double Gamma function    in
the following way

G_b(z)=_2^-1 (zb,1/b).  
 The Barnes
double Gamma function is related to the double Hurwitz function
, 
_2^s(x_1,_2)= _m,n>0  (n_1+m_2+x)^-s , 
in the following way
_2(x_1,_2) = ( s  _2^s(x_1,_2) _s=0 ).  
It follows from  and   that 
has a product representation

_2^-1 (z_1,_2)= e^z^22 _21   +
z_22  z _m=0 ^_n=0 ^ (1+
z   )e^-z + z^22^2  , 
where  and 
are functions of  but not  which can be found in

It follows from  that
G_b(-z)G_b(z) = -  e^ +2
z_22   _m=0 ^_n=0 ^ (z+
  -z+ )e^-2z   . 
In the limit  with  one finds ,

( S_b(x))= i( x^22  - Q
x2 -12 (b^2+1b^2 +2))+o(1 x ).
