We consider CIV-DV
prepotential  for   SYM theory at the
extremum  of the effective
 superpotential and prove the relation
  

Introduction 

In this note we consider the Cachazo-Intriligator-Vafa prepotential for   SYM
theory, which is equal to the free energy  for the one matrix holomorphic
integral with the polynomial potential, defined as a perturbative
expansion around the certain extremum of the action.


e^-F _m  = _N   ^-N^2 N    d _NN 
e^-1 g_s  W(_0 + ) 
 
Here  is a complex matrix,
and the integral is an analogue of a contour integral in the one
dimensional case, so that the real dimension of the integration domain is .
Naively, one can treat the integral
just as an ordinary hermitian matrix integral in the case of the
even order potential, but generally speaking, one should explicitly specify
the domain of the integration for  the integral to be convergent.
While we do not study the problem in its full complexity,
we yet adopt the prescription of the perturbative expansion around some extremum of the action
(it becomes an additional argument of ),
and in this case we have not to explicitly specify a contour of integration, since
the result depend only on a local structure of the action around the expansion point. So, in a perturbative
calculation one can treat the integral just as an ordinary hermitian one matrix model with  symmetry.

The action  is  a polynomial of degree . We define 
W'(x) = _i=1 ^n  (x-_i) x^n - _k=2 ^n  g_k
x^n-k ,_i=1 ^n _i=0  






The critical points of the matrix action are given by specifying how
 eigenvalues of the matrix  are distributed around the
 critical points  of the potential .

Let  is the number of the eigenvalues of  that are
equal to . In the planar (quasiclassical) limit 
 the result for the free energy can be represented as an
expansion over the genus of fat Feynman diagrams for the matrix
model
  F_m = _g=0 ^  g_s^2g-2 
F_g (S_i,_i)
 
with  .
We focus on the planar
contribution  to the free energy , from which the SW
solution for the pure  gauge theory  can be constructed
.

It has  the following structure
 F_pl =1  g_s^2  F (S_i g_s N_i ,_i),FF_0  
with the following leading terms of :

 F(S_i,_i) = _i  W(_i)
S_i - _i  1 2 S_i^2  S_i 
^2_i   - 3 4 S_i^2  - _i<j  2 S_i S_j _ij     +O(S^3)  
where

a_ij  _i - _j 

 _i _j i  a_ij  = W"(_i)
 
The first piece of F_pl  is the classical contribution, the second is due to the logarithm of the
volume of  group and the gaussian integration,
and the third is from the jacobian of .


Then, the following object is believed  to be a superpotential in the  effective low energy
theory, that is obtained after integration out the adjoint field :

W_eff  (S_i,_i) = _i  F  S_i 
 

According to, to construct the SW solution for the  theory,
one should consider an extremum point   of 
. W_eff   S_i   _S_i   =. _j  ^2 F 
S_i S_j _S_i   =  0
 
since it is believed that in this point
  and
matrix model curve  becomes the SW curve.

This condition  d2F  could  be easily explained from the field theory
side. It means decoupling of the common  factor in the effective low-energy theory.
Unfortunately, in the matrix integral
picture the meaning of this condition is not clear yet, in spite of the rapid development of the issue.
We hope that it could be interpreted as a condition for a point, where the perturbative calculation
in some "right" way (still not understood rigorously now) coincides with the exact, non perturbative
definition of the matrix integral def1 .



In this letter we proposed(instead of discuss) another non trivial relation that holds in this point
 
but not in a general point! 
,
 involving
not only the second derivatives, but the value of  and its first derivatives itself, showing
that for the matrix integral the point  is indeed a very special one!

This relation is (here  due to 
)

. V 2F - S_i F  S_i _S_i   = -  2 g_2^2n   n^2-1 
 
This relation was recently discovered by Matone in the  case in a slightly
different form and was checked by the perturbative expansion. We
generalize and prove this relation for an arbitrary unitary gauge group.

Recall, that a similar fact about
the  SW effective prepotential
 
which also  was discovered by same author  and
 after generalized for other groups and proved in all orders in two ways 
  F_SW ^2 =2F_SW  - a_i F_SW   a_i  =-8i_0 u_2
 has a clear RG interpretation in  SYM theory.
Its simple form can also be explained using superconformal Ward identities
.



It will be very interesting to find a similar interpretation for the identity
mat  in terms of matrix model RG and
to explain simple and very similar to the r.h.s. of x  form of the r.h.s. of
mat .
Probably, it is possible to find some interpretation of this relation on a
field theory side, similarly to the interpretation of the Virasoro constraints in
terms of the generalized Konishi anomaly.




It should be also remarked that the relation mat  looks like a consequence
of the exactness of quasiclassical approximation.
In fact, dropping all terms except the  classical (the first) one in F 
 F^cl =W(_i) S_i^cl  
and using only classical
 
the leading in the expansion series over  
 term for 
S_i^cl  = ^2n   _i  
one could easily get the result

V^cl   = W(_i)  ^2n   _i =^2n   2i  W(z)  W'(z)  dz=
  - 2 g_2 ^2n   n^2-1 
 
The relation is not the only one that holds exactly in its classical form at the special point
. The classical result for the superpotential that follows
from ff 
W_eff =W(_i) 
is  also exact at the special point .

The property of the classical approximation to be exact is some consequence
of the planar limit in def1  and, perhaps, it can enlighten the question of the role of
the special point  from the matrix model point of view.



The first proof of the  relation 
In this section we present the proof of the relation mat .
We consider the planar contribution to the free energy that has a structure

F_pl  = g_s^-2  F(g_s N_i,_i)
 
Differentiating over  we see

_g_s  F_pl  =  (-2 g_s^-3  F + g_s^-3  F  S_i  S_i) = -g_s^-3  V
 
From the definition of the  as a free energy we know, that its derivative over a parameter
is a vacuum expectation value of the correspondingly coupled operator.
Since in the planar limit

F_pl  = - d e^-g_s^-1  W()  
 
then

-g_s^-3  V = _g_s  F_pl  = -g_s^-2   W() 
V = g_s  W() 
 
The expectation values can be calculated with the help of the exact algebraic equation
that can be obtained in the planar limit
 for the resolvent:

R(z) g_s 1 z -   
 

The loop equation (or Ward identity  for the variation ) in the planar
limit (when the correlation functions for single trace operators factorize like
)
 is the following

R(z)^2 = R(z) W'(z) + f_n-1 (z)
 
Here  is yet an arbitrary polynomial of the order . Its  coefficients
 specify values of  through the relation

S_i = 1 2i  _A_i  R(z) dz
 
Here and below we use the  notations of for cycles on complex plane.
From the equation loopeq 
we read the solution .

Via  one can easily calculate the expectation values of the single trace operators
  like:

g_s^k  =  1 2i  _A  R(z)z^k dz

A=_i=1 ^n A_i,  (z)    12i _A  dz  (z)=_z=  (z)
 

For an arbitrary polynomial we have

g_sP()   =  1 2i  _A  P(z) R(z) dz
 

From we know that at the special point 
and the leading term for  is indeed given by Scl 


S _i = -A_i  1 2  (x+_i-2^n /_i)(x+_i + 2^n /_i)   _i +...=
^2n _i  
 
Now we are near the desired result

g_sW()  = - C  W(x)   W'(x)^2-4^2n    2  =
 _z=  W(z)  W'(z) ^2n 
 
because

_z=  W(z)  W'(z)  = _z= 
 1 n+1  x^n+1 -g_2 1 n-1  x^n-1  +..   x^n -g_2 x^n-2  +..  = g_2 1 n+1  - 1 n-1   = -g_2 2  n^2-1 
 
This is the end of the first proof.

The second proof of the  relation 
The second proof of mat  checks the  definition of 
 as an integral over some non closed contour , and determines the
r.h.s. of mat  up to an overall constant, which was
checked by the perturbative calculations in the introduction. Note, that
the coincidence between the perturbative matrix model calculation for 
and the integral of some differential along  cycle is not straightforward,
and a lot of work is required to check this identity explicitly even in the first few orders.

Let us consider the partial derivative of  mat  over  considering
 as the functions that  depend on  and 
V g_k =2Fg_k + S^i _D
S^ig_k  -S^i  S^i _Dg_k  
 
at the special point  .

First term could be calculated similarly to the derivative over :
2Fg_k =-2 g_s  ^n-k+1    n-k+1  =12i 
_A  dz  z^n-k+1 n-k+1  y-W' 

=_A  dz  n-k+1   -4^2n z^n-k+1 2W' +O1z^2n    =-2^2n  (n-1) _k,2 
 
The values  and   defined as

S^i=12i _A_i  R(x) dx

S_D^i=_B_i  R(x) dx

R(x)=1 2 W'(x)-y(x) 
 
Note that the non-compact cycles  has a nice property  for
, where compact cycles 
and  for  form the canonical basis of cycles
on the hyperelliptic curve .

On the special curve  the differential  has no residues. That is why
, and thus we can change the contour from  to 
() in the definition of  def  without changing bn .

Now the second and the third terms in bn  could be easily calculated with a help of the Riemann
bilinear relation yielding
S^i _D S^ig_k  -S^i  S^i _Dg_k
 = - 18i _i _a_i y dx_b_i y g_k dx-_a_i  y g_k dx_b_i  y dx  =


=-1  4   ^x_x_0  y(z) dzyg_k (x)  

It is useful to set  to coincide with some root of ,
then this point will belong to the both branches of the curve, and
thus the eventual result is twice larger than the one pole result.

At the infinity (near the pole)
^x_x_0  y(z) dz=W(x)+4^2n 2(n-1) x^n-1  +const + O1x^n   ,  x  
and
yg_k (x)=-x^n-k  1+4^2n  2 (W')^2 +O1x^4n      x  
Multiplying these two quantities by each other one could simply  get
^x_x_0  y(z) dzyg_k (x)=-4^2n 2 x^k-1  1(n+1) +1(n-1)  +Q(x)+O(1x^k+2  ),   x  where  is some polynomial.
Thus, substituting we  into er  and adding it to rt we get
Vg_k =-^2n  1(n-1) -1(n+1)  _k,2 
 
This is the end of second proof, since the result r   coincides with the partial
derivative over  of mat .

Conclusion 

In this note we proposed a new relation which holds for the CIV prepotential
at the special  point .



As was mentioned above this relation has the similar form to the renormalization group equation
for the Seiberg-Witten prepotential,
 and it would be interesting to understand it from the matrix model RG point of view.

 We  expect the straightforward generalization of this relation for other
gauge groups and for theory with matter.

We hope that the proposed relation will help to specify in some natural way
the conditions for the point  at the matrix model side, and thus
gives more evidence on relation between matrix models and
SUSY gauge theories.
