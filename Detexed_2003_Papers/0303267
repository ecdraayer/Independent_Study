matches ).  
Perfect actions for QCD are in principle the fixed point actions
under this transformation. They are, in principle,
implemented in the fully interacting
quantum field theory.  They are typically quasilocal, involving
suppressed (next-to) nearest neighbor interactions.  
Approximate 
forms have been  constructed,,
and the Gaussian  perfect action  
gives the best starting point for
a perturbative quantum perfect action. 

In the case of compactified extra dimensions and
their deconstructed description,  the situation
with respect to scale invariance is drastically
different than that of QCD. Here
we do not 
have scale invariance. We have instead
two relevant scales: (1) a high energy or fundamental, or "string
scale," , and (2) the low energy 
compactification scale .
The compactification 
scale   is identified with the mass of the lowest
KK mode.  RG transformations of interest must therefore
act within the range of scales , but
must not affect  and , 
which define the theory. 
Indeed, a continuum extra dimensional theory is generally
never scale invariant. The stress
tensor trace is nonzero in , and the coupling constant
is dimensional. This is the origin of
the power-law running of the coupling constant.
In deconstruction, the corresponding 
stress tensor trace matches the  stress
tensor trace through the presence of the "linking
Higgs" fields, which have nonzero VEV's of order 
explicitly breaking scale invariance.

In deconstruction, the continuous
translational symmetry in an
extra dimension is replaced by a discrete
 symmetry. The kinetic
terms become
 invariant hopping terms. Locality
implies that hopping terms do not have strong linking to
distant sites. This is the key to having
anything resembling a ladder spectrum. For example, if one constructs a
"complete" lattice of  sites, 
linking each site to every other site with a hoping
term strength , as
in Figure (1),
the spectrum will be have a single zero mode, and 
degenerate levels of mass . This is as
far from a ladder spectrum as one can get.

    
    
psfile=hex.eps    
          angle=0 hscale=60 vscale=60 hoffset=120 voffset=-30     
    
A "complete octagon" has each
of the 8 sites linked to every other site. The eigenmode
spectrum is one zero mode and 7 modes of mass .
    
     

It is locality, therefore, together with 
invariance, that 
sets up the hierarchy between the high scale
 and the compactification scale
, and uniformly
populates the spectrum on scales  with KK modes.
 Nevertheless, any restriction to local, 
mainly nearest neighbor, links appears to be 
arbitrary
from a "theory space" point of view.
The  symmetry however, will select 
the fixed point theory, enforcing
quasi-locality and a linear ladder
spectrum.

We can understand  with the following
metaphor. Suppose we are climbing a tall 
cell-phone tower ladder, and
we are in the middle of the ladder
at a scale , roughly
midway between the top of the ladder () and 
bottom  (). When we are midway
up the ladder (),
we are far from any fundamental
scale, and the
effective Lagrangian should be insensitive to changes in . 
The ladder 
reflects an approximate symmetry in momentum space
in that, "hopping up" several rungs, the ladder 
should appear to us to be the same physical environment. 
Suppose we double , thus doubling the height
of the ladder while holding the
rung spacing on the ladder fixed. 
This maps our ladder with 
rungs into one with  rungs. 
Now we follow this 
with another operation that integrates out 
of the rungs and rescales the ladder height
by . Under these combined
operations we have no net rescaling,
but trivially recover the original 
linear ladder with  rungs.

More generally, however,
if the ladder is not uniform, we might double the
number of rungs by some procedure,
 times, thus increasing its height by . Then  we
"integrate out" half the rungs  times by averaging
over the locations of rungs that are integrated, suitably smearing
out the local inhomogeneities. We expect then that
an arbitrary inhomogeneous ladder becomes flat in the large  limit.
Thus, while the spectrum of the nearest neighbor theory is
not flat, having the phonon  structure,
under application of this th order RG
transformation we expect it to flow
toward a fixed point, until it flattens, .
An action which is a fixed point under
this transformation should be the perfect action we seek.


In Section 3 we will make this more precise in the language
of "decoration" and "dedecoration" transformations,
which are defined in configuration space. We first
define the product of a decoration
transformation  and a dedecoration transformation  
to be the identity transformation. We illustrate
our general technique by
carrying out an analysis of the trivial
case of  decorations followed by
 dedecorations,  
to set up the subsequent nontrivial case of interest. 

We then consider decoration transformations
followed by Bell-Wilson (BW) transformations
 acting on scalar field theories.
The BW transformation acts in momentum space
to define the block spin variables, and introduces
a new parameter, , which is the "wave-function 
renormalization constant" of the block-spin variable.
Thus, we perform a decoration transformation 
followed by a Bell-Wilson transformation  times, ,
which groups the original
sites into "block spins" and maps the theory back to 
the original 
branes.  We thus have  defined through
 and we are interested in the formal
limit  as .

The Gaussian fixed point of the
BW transformation is found for the special 
value .
The spectrum, under 
the  transformation for large 
flows toward the linear ladder spectrum.
Indeed, the spectrum has the form
 
under , 
and flows toward the flat
 spectrum
as .
The action of the deconstructed theory which
is itself a fixed point under  as   
corresponds to "a perfect action," analogous to
perfect actions in lattice QCD.
This codifes the sense in
which the ladder spectrum is special,
within the context of theory space.




Transformations for
Deconstructed Lattice Scalars in  



We begin by considering transformations
which augment or thin the degrees of freedom
of   theories of many complex scalar fields.
These transformations stem from 
symmetries noticed long ago in the Ising model, 
.   
In the language of
Ising models a single spin-link-spin combination 
in the Hamiltonian can
always be "decorated," , 
written as a spin-link-spin-link-spin interaction.
That is, we can "integrate in" the new spin,
or "decorate" the original single link. Thus, an -spin
system can be viewed as a  spin system upon decorating.
The decorations can be arbitrarily complicated, involving many
new spins. Conversely, we can "integrate out" or "dedecorate"
the spins internal to a chain whose endpoint spins are then renormalized
(Fig.(2)).
   
    
    
psfile=dedecorate.eps    
          angle=0 hscale=60 vscale=60 hoffset=90 voffset=-20     
    
The -chain  -chain dedecoration 
transformation integrates out the internal field and renormalizes the 
endpoint fields' kinetic terms and mass terms.    
     
   

 
Decoration is an exact transformation for Ising spins, and
continuous spins (e.g., "spherical models" are spin systems
which correspond to our models in the absence of kinetic terms). 
Presently our "spins" are fields that 
have  kinetic terms. For us decoration and 
dedecoration
transformations are 
exact transformations only in the limit
of very large cut-off .  This happens because we perform
decoration transformations truncating on
quartic derivatives, such as .
This is, nonetheless,  a good approximate 
transformation in the 
limit, or for the low lying states in the spectrum. 
These transformations become
symmetries in the continnum
limit
when the theory is classically scale
invariant, ,  and .   
The  
 kinetic terms undergo renormalizations
under these transformations, and 
thus distinguish the present construction
from that of a spin model.  


Decoration 
Transformations  

 
Consider  an  complex scalar field Lagrangian in ,
which can be viewed as a deconstructed   compactified extra
dimension  with periodic boundary conditions:
L  _N = Z_N^N _a=1  _a^2 
- _N^2 ^N _a=1  _a -_a+1 ^2 
- _N^2 ^N _a=1  _a^2 
and assume periodicity, hence
. It is convenient to
allow for noncanonical normalization of the kinetic
terms, and we thus display the arbitrary wave-function renormalization
constant .

A decoration transformation replaces 
by a new Lagrangian   with 
fields and new parameters.
L  _N L  _2N  = Z_2N ^2N _a=1  _a^2 
- _2N ^2 ^2N _a=1  _a -_a+1 ^2 
- _2N ^2 ^2N _a=1  _a^2 
and again assume periodicity, hence

The new parameters are chosen so that upon integrating out 
every other field (e.g., those with even  in the sums), we
recover the original Lagrangian . 

We define the new decorated Lagrangian
parameters by demanding 
that  be equivalent to
 upon "dedecorating," , integrating out
every other field.  We seek
the relation between the parameters  of
, and the  of
.
It is useful to consider
 as a sum over 3-chains:
L  _2N  = ^2N-1 _nodd  L  _n,n+2  
Each 3-chain involves three fields. 
The first 3-chain is:
L  _1,3  = Z_2N 
(_1 ^2 + 2_2 ^2
+_3 ^2)
- _2N ^2_1 -_2 ^2 - _2N ^2_2 -_3 ^2 
- _2N ^2 (_1 ^2+2_2 ^2+_3 ^2)
The fields  and  share
half their kinetic terms and  terms
with the adjacent chains, thus carry the normalization factors
of  within the chain.
 can be thus viewed as a "decoration" of the
chain. We integrate out the internal field  and obtain
an equivalent renormalized chain.
Integrating out  :
L  _1,3  & = & Z_2N (_1^2 + _3^2) - 
(_2N ^2+_2N ^2)(_1^2+_3^2)
+ 


& & + _2N ^4 (_1+_3 )^1 Z_2N ^2 +
2_2N ^2+_2N ^2 (_1+_3 )
Expanding in the derivatives to ,
integrating by parts, regrouping terms, and
relabeling parameters gives:
L  _1,3  = Z_N(_1^2 + _3^2)- 
_N ^2_1 -_3 ^2 -_N ^2
(_1^2 + _3^2)
-_N(_1-_3 )^2 + O  (^4/^2)
where we now have the relationship
between the  parameters of
eq.() and eq.():
Z_N & = & Z_2N 8_2N ^4 + 4_2N ^2_2N ^2 
+_2N ^4 4_2N ^4 + 4_2N ^2^2 +_2N ^4 
2Z_2N 


_N ^2 & = & _2N ^4 2_2N ^2 +_2N ^2   _2N ^2


_N ^2 & = & 4_2N ^2 _2N ^2+_2N ^4 2_2N ^2
 +_2N ^2  
2_2N ^2


_N & = & Z_2N _2N ^4 (2_2N ^2 +_2N ^2)^2 1 4 Z_2N 
Finally,
we relabel the indices so they are sequential, i.e.,  where
 runs from , and .
We then rewrite the Lagrangian:
L  _2N  =  Z_N ^N _b=1  
- _N ^2 ^N _b=1  -b+1 ^2 
- _N ^2 ^N _b=1  
-_N^N _b=1 (b+1 )^2 
+ O  (^4/^2)
Thus, we have returned to the original theory, ,
modulo the  term and the higher derivative terms.
The presence of the  term, and higher
derivatives, reflects the fact
that our dedecoration transformation is not exact. These terms
are "irrelevant operators," however.
The  term has been written in the indicated form
because, though it superficially appears to be a relevant 
operator, 
it too is a quartic derivative on the lattice, , ( in )
(a nearest neighbor hopping term on the lattice). 
It effects
only the high mass limit of the KK mode spectrum. 
It will therefore be dropped
for consistency with the expansion 
to order .

In eqs.() we have written the approximate forms of the
renormalizations of the parameters in the large
 limit.
Note that the  term is multiplicatively renormalized.
This owes to the fact that it is the true scale-breaking term in the
theory when the lattice is taken very fine, and  terms 
become  derivatives, , as  the theory
has a zero-mode. Since it alone breaks the symmetry
of scale-invariance, elevating the zero-mode,
it is therefore multiplicatively renormalized in free field theory. 

We now attempt to define   as a product
of  decorations followed by  dedecoration
transformations. This will, of course, be
the identity, and we'll recover the original
Lagrangian, but it illustrates the technique
for the subsequent nontrivial
case involving the BW transformation. We first 
iterate the decoration transformation of eq.()
 times to obtain a  decorated theory:
L  _2^kN  = 
Z_2^kN ^2^kN _a=1  _a^2 
- _2^kN ^2 ^2^kN _a=1  _a -_a+1 ^2 
- _2^kN ^2 ^2^kN _a=1  _a^2 
and again assume periodicity, hence
.
The new parameters are chosen so that upon 
applications of the dedecoration
transformation, we
recover the original Lagrangian .

We diagonalize eq.() with periodic
compactification:
_a = 1 2^kN  ^2^kN _n=1  e^2i na/2^kN  _n;
_a + 2^kN  = _a
note: S = ^2^kN _a=1  e^2i(n-m) a/2^kN  
= 2^kN_nm 
whence:
L  _2^kN (q^2) = Z_2^kN ^2^kN _n=1  ^(k) _n^2 -  
^2^kN _n=1  (4_2^k N ^2^2(n/2^kN) +_2^kN ^2)^(k) _n^2
Note that 
we have the zero-mode, corresponding to
,  which is a singlet 
(equivalent to choosing , which
is outside the first Brillouin zone). 
Each level within
the first Brillouin zone with  is degenerate with
another level , thus forming a doublet. This doubling of 
energy levels is physical, corresponding
to the mode expansion in  in terms of , 
and , where the sine and cosine terms are
degenerate modes (or equivalently, left-movers and right-movers).
With orbifold compactification each level would be a singlet, and
what we say presently works as well in the orbifold case.


For KK modes of
momentum , we have
from the momentum space form
of eq.(), 
L  _2^kN  = _q ^2^kN _n=1  _n^(k) (q^2) 
^(k) _q,n ^2 
_n^(k) (q^2) = Z_2^kN q^2 
- 4_2^kN ^2^2(n/2^k N) - ^2_2^kN 
The parameters of the -th order decorated theory
may be written in terms of the parameters of the 
 theory from eqs.():
Z_2^kN    =  2^-k Z_N 
_2^kN ^2  =  2^k _N ^2
_2^kN ^2 = 2^-k _N ^2 
Note that, while we're writing
things in momentum space, the actual dedecorations
are done in configuration space, , we return to configuration
space to integrate out
alternating fields. At the th iteration
the number
of fields remaining is  and
we replace the current 
coefficents by new set of , with
 Fourier coefficients.  We then rediagonalize  
to obtain the new momentum space expression for
. This replaces the previous
value of  by  in the argument of
the  of eq.().

We thus obtain ,  from the rescalings
of eq.(), ,
, where:
_n^(0)  = 2^-k Z_N q^2 
- 2^-k+2 _N ^2^2(n/N) - 2^-k _N ^2
where  now appears in the argument of
.

Renormalizing the fields 
to canonical normalization  leads to: 
_n^(0)  q^2 
- 4^2^2(n/N) - ^2
where:
^2^2_N/Z_N ^2^2_N/Z_N
We have recovered the original
theory.  Decoration and dedecoration transformations
are inverses of one another. Indeed, that is how they were
constructed. 

As we now see, to define , such that the 
compactification scale  and
number of modes  is held fixed, 
such that we obtain a linear ladder spectrum,
we must follow decoration
by a transformation that thins degrees of freedom
in momentum space. 



Bell-Wilson Transformation  


We now consider 
where is  a degree-of-freedom thinning transformation 
that  acts upon the decorated theory,
 of eq.(). 
is the BW transformation, 
which, contrary to dedecoration,
is defined  in momentum space. Moreover,
the rescaling from  is now
controlled by a new parameter, ,
which is associated with the block-spin 
wave-function normalization. 
For a special
choice of 
we will scale toward a Gaussian fixed point theory
which recovers the linear ladder spectrum. 

The parameters of , the ,
are given in terms of  by eq.().
We again diagonalize eq.() with periodic
compactification obtaining eq.() and
adopt the compact notation
for  of eq.() in momentum space
where the field's  Fourier coefficients
are denoted .

The Bell-Wilson transformation can be
phrased as a mapping from the action  
as a functional of the "old"  variables,  
to a new actiuon,  in the "new"
 variables, :
e^iS _(2^k-1 N) (^(k-1) )  
= D^(k)   T(^(k-1) , ^(k) ) 
e^iS _(2^k N) (^(k) ) 
We choose a Gaussian block spin redefinition
in momentum space, of the form:
 T(^(k-1) , ^k) = (i K _n=0 ^2^k-1 N  ^(k-1) _n 
 -^(k) _n^2  )
Here  is a (large) mass scale parameter, and is formally
arbitrarily defined relative to the normalizations
of the 's.  is introduced to engineer a functional
delta-function, locking the new
 and the old 
together.  should exceed the largest physical scale
in the problem, which is the hopping parameter .
Let us therefore define:
K = F _2^k N ^2 F>>1.
The key to the BW transformation is that we
we integrate out half of
the old momentum space modes for a given value of .
Half of the  modes, from  to , 
are mapped into the new 
 modes,
while the remaining high momentum, or short distance,
 modes are simply  integrated out. 
The  modes are
labelled by indices that run from  to .
The fact that only half of the  
momentum modes are mapped
into the transformed action means that the  modes
are "block spins" in configuration space.
It is not hard to see, in configuration space, that
one BW transformation yields   new fields, ,
written as blocks spins of the   old fields, 
as:
_a^new  
=  2  _b=1 ^2^kN  ((a-b/2)) a-b/2 _b^old 
where we have labelled the  new
fields as , and the old
ones as , and we have 
absorbed phases into .
  plays the fundamental role of 
defining the wave-function
normalization of the new spin block
spin variables. 

Successive application
of the BW transformation  times leads to:
e^iS^(0) (^(0) ) 
=D^(k) ..D^(1) 
e^iK_n=1 ^2^k-1 N ^(k)  - ^(k-1)  ^2 
...e^iK_n=1 ^2N ^(1)  - ^(0)  ^2 
e^- _n=1 ^2^kN ^(2^kN) _n _n^(k)  ^2 
Under the th transformation of the  variables
into the
 variables we find:
S_(2^((= K _q _n=1 ^2^(_n^() (q^2) K^2 +
^() _n(q^2)  _q,n ^() ^2
hence:
_n^(= _n^()  (^2)
+_n^() /K  
This is a recursion relation which 
we can easily
solve for the general map from ,
corresponding to , 
back to , corresponding to .
We obtain:
S_N (^(0) ) =  _q _n=1 ^N _n^(0) (q^2)_q,n ^(0) ^2
where:
_n^(0)  = _n^(k)  (^2k ) 
+c_k_n^(k) /K  
c_k = ^-2k  ( ^2+2k -1)(^2-1 )^-1 

This is the general renormalization group for the kinetic
term part of the theory. 

For KK modes of
momentum , we have for the th order
decorated theory, 
^(k) (q^2) = Z_2^kN q^2 
- 4_2^kN ^2^2(n/2^k N) - ^2_2^kN 
From the original decoration transformation
acting on  we have: 
Z_2^kN 2^-k Z_N 

_N^2 = Z_N ^2
 _2^kN ^2 = 2^k Z_N ^2 

K = 2^k  F Z_N ^2
through the RG results of eq.().
The scale  is the RG invariant 
mass of the first KK-mode.
We also have:
 Z^-1 _2^kN ^2_2^kN  =Z^-1 _N _N ^2 ^2 
 hence:  ^2_2^kN  = 2^-k ^2 
where  is the RG invariant physical mass scale.

We note that a key difference between the
BW transformation and the dedecoration transformation, is
that in the  at the th
order of iterating the transformation, the 
the KK-mode mass term involves , and
not  !  
This is a direct consequence
of the fact that the BW transformation is defined through eq.()
in momentum space , and we do not return to configuration space
to integrate out fields!

Finally, for large  and we see that
c_k 1 1-^2 ^-2k < 1;
c_k1 > 1.
The final action after  iterations
of the BW transformation is summed over
 degrees of freedom,
and we can therefore write, for :
^(0) _n 
=  _n=1 ^N 2^-k Z_N (q^2 
- 2^2k+2 ^2^2(n/2^kN)- ^2)_n^(0) ^2 
^2k +
^-2k 2^-2k Z_N 
[(q^2-2^2k+2 ^2^2(n/2^kN)-^2)
/(1-^2)Z_N F ^2]
 
The generality of the
BW transformation
is contained in the freedom to choose the 
parameter . If 
 we see that the second term
in the denominator dominates in the large  limit
and the theory becomes a static (nonpropagating) system,
^(0) _n(q^2)
_n=1 ^N ^2k 2^k (1-^2)Z_N F ^2
_n^(0) ^2 
This is essentially an auxilliary field theory 
with the effective
kinetic term normalization set to zero.

For the special case 

we have 
and the theory approaches a nontrivial fixed point,
called the "Gaussian fixed point." We can exercise
our freedom to define
the original kinetic term normalization constant . 
For  we have:

^(0) _n  & = &
(q^2-2^-2k+2 ^2^2( n/2^k N)-^2) 
1+4(q^2-2^-2k+2 ^2^2( n/2^k N)-^2)/3F ^2 

 
& &  q^2-4^2 n^2^2/N^2 - ^2 +
O  (1/F).
which leads to the "linear ladder spectrum" of  KK modes
as :
m_n^2 = 4^2(n/N)^2+^2
 Therefore,  defined as a th order decoration
of an -mode containing deconstructed theory,
followed by the th order Bell-Wilson transformation
at the fixed point 
 yields a theory with -modes
and the linearized spectrum.

If 
 we see that the first term
in the denominator dominates in the large  limit
and the theory scales as:

^(0) _n 
^-2k 2^-k  Z_N (q^2-2^2k+2 ^2^2( n/2^k N)- ^2)
We can  define
 where :

^(0) _n 
^-k (q^2- 4^2( n/N)^2-^2)
Therefore,  
 defines a fixed
line of theories with ladder 
spectrum.  The Gaussian fixed point
is presumably stable in the presence of interactions,
as in the nonlinear generalization of Bell and Wilson. 



Discussion and Conclusion   

We have considered RG transformations that
act in a theory space of  degrees of freedom.
This theory space a priori  knows nothing
of extra dimensions and geometry. Nonetheless,
a particular RG transformation , constructed
from a net scale-invariant pair of RG transformations,
has  a fixed point corresponding to an effective theory 
of a compactified geometrical extra dimension. 

More specifically, we have observed that
the combination of a -fold decoration
transformation, followed by a -fold 
Bell-Wilson transformation
can produce a theory with (i) no rescaling of the number of
degrees of freedom, , and (ii) a fixed point
with a linear KK-mode spectrum, when 
 is defined with its parameter 
. This
corresponds to the Gaussian fixed point 
of the Bell-Wilson transformation. 

This has been a preliminary look
at the problem of constructing more
general  operators. There remains a great
to do. It
should be possible to implement this transformation
in an interacting theory, in analogy to QCD. 

 as we've defined
it requires that we exit the microcanonical ensemble
of  modes, passing to  modes, as an intermediate step.
This is fine for free field theory, but apparently
undesirable in the interacting case because 
the physical interacting
theory is bounded in  by
the perturbative unitarity.  
This latter issue
however, may be a red-herring.
It may be possible to make the step outside
the microcanonical ensemble 
if we also make the effective coupling
scale, ,  times smaller upon
decoration, which defines the
decoration transformation as holding the 
 high energy coupling constant at the scale 
  fixed. 
 


It would be useful to connect to the differential
form of the RG, which is more
familiar in QFT perturbation theory.  Ultimately, we 
would prefer a more
abstract definition of  that lives
entirely within the microcanonical
ensemble of fixed  theories in theory space.
A possible route to a more general 
may involve abstracting from the present procedure.
It is a simple matter to write the fixed
point theory as a Lagrangian of the form:
L  ^*_N = ^N _a=1  _a^2 
- _N^2 ^N _a=1  ^N _b=1 c_b_a -_a+b ^2 
- _N^2 ^N _a=1  _a^2 
where the  are chosen to yield the flat spectrum.
This involves a simple Fourier transform
of the flat spectrum.
It would be instructive to frame the action of 
the th order  on
a generic , containing arbitrary coefficients,
, as a mapping of  ,
and to observe the approach to the fixed point theory.
This may permit an abstraction of ,
which discards the decoration and BW transformations
altogether, and a  that is
more practically useful than the detailed procedure we
have outline presently.
Nonetheless, the detailed procedure we have followed here
shows conceptually what is involved in constructing
a geometrical RG transformation .

We note that a number of the issues regarding
locality vs. geometry arise in novel approaches 
to deconstructing gravity. The RG as
a geometrical 
symmetry may prove to be a useful tool in this arena.
These and other related issues are under present
consideration.
