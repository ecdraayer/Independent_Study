The Ginsparg-Wilson algebra is the algebra underlying the Ginsparg-Wilson
solution of the fermion doubling problem in lattice gauge theory. The Dirac 
operator of the fuzzy sphere is not afflicted with this problem. Previously
we have indicated that there is a Ginsparg-Wilson operator underlying
it as well in the absence of gauge fields and instantons. Here we
develop this observation systematically and establish a Dirac operator
theory for the fuzzy sphere with or without gauge fields, and always
with the Ginsparg-Wilson algebra. There is no fermion doubling in this
theory. The association of the Ginsparg-Wilson algebra with the fuzzy
sphere is surprising as the latter is not designed with this algebra
in mind. The theory reproduces the integrated  anomaly and
index theory correctly.

Introduction 

A central task in lattice approximation to quantum field theories
(qft's) is the treatment of chiral fermions. General theorems due to
Nielsen and Ninomiya and others reveal a serious
obstruction to their rigorous formulation on a lattice. As the
standard model involves chiral fermions, there is thus a fundamental
difficulty with lattice approximations.

Years ago,  Ginsparg and  Wilson proposed an
approximate manner to overcome this difficulty. In the original
formulation, it is based on a Dirac and chirality operator fulfilling
particular algebraic relations. In the continuum limit, anticommuting
Dirac and chirality operators can be obtained therefrom. The
Ginsparg-Wilson method is an effective tool in the theoretical
analysis of lattice theories and reproduces important topological effects
like chiral anomalies in an approximate manner. 

Fuzzy physics concerns an approach to
regulating qft's which can be an alternative to lattice methods. It
gives finite-dimensional matrix approximations to qft's and
incorporates ideas of non-commutative geometry. It has a
well-articulated theory of Dirac operator for the fuzzy sphere which
approximates the continuum Dirac operator very well and also
reproduces the correct index theory and chiral anomaly. Subtle
topological features like instantons and complex structures can be
formulated. Chiral fermions too can be described with no
fermion doubling. For fuzzy 
-models as well, the Dirac operator to the extent investigated
 seems an excellent approximation to the continuum Dirac
operator and capable of reproducing significant topological features
of the continuum.

In a previous paper, we reported our joint work on the
Dirac operator for the fuzzy sphere. Here we establish that the 'free'
fuzzy Dirac operator in the absence of instantons fulfills the
defining relations of the Ginsparg-Wilson algebraic system. This
result has a strong element of surprise as fuzzy physics is not
consciously designed to fulfill such relations. 

In this paper we review our previous work and extend it to cover gauge
fields and instanton sectors. This extension has a new formulation of
the Dirac operator on the fuzzy sphere, and is based on an appropriate
realization of the Ginsparg-Wilson algebra. This Dirac operator has
several positive features. Its spectrum in the absence of gauge field
fluctuations is precisely that in the continuum when the latter is
cut-off  at a suitable angular momentum. There is no correction
whatever to spectrum below the cut-off. There is no fermion doubling
and chiral fermions can be effortlessly treated. The  anomaly
in the integrated form is reproduced exactly. We have not looked at
its local form, but its treatment in alternative approaches exists
.

For other work applying the Ginsparg-Wilson approach to the fuzzy 
sphere, see.

While these are points in favour of our approach, it appears that
the Ginsparg-Wilson approach, either in the lattice or fuzzy physics
context, is not easy to adapt to numerical work. This is a serious
difficulty and has to be overcome.



A Review of the Ginsparg-Wilson Algebra. 

We follow in this presentation.

In its generality, the Ginsparg-Wilson algebra  can be
defined as the unital -algebra over  generated by two
-invariant involutions  and :
A =,^2=
^*=,,
 denoting the adjoint.
The unity of  has been indicated by .

In any such algebra, we can define a Dirac operator

D'=1 a (+,
where  is the lattice spacing. It fulfills
D' ^*= D',[,D']_+=aD'D' .
() and () give the original formulation
.  But they are equivalent to (), since 
() and () imply that
is a -invariant involution.

Each representation of () is a particular realization of the
Ginsparg-Wilson algebra. Representations of physical interest are
reducible.

In our work we choose
D=1 a (+,
instead of  as our Dirac operator, as it is self-adjoint and has
the desired continuum limit.

From  and , we can construct the following elements of
:
_0&=&1 2 [,,   

_1&=&1 2 (+,   

_2&=&1 2 (,   

_3&=&1 2i [,.   Let us first look at the centre  of  in
terms of these operators. It is generated by  which commutes
with  and  and hence with every element of .
 also commute with every element of  ,
but they are not independent of . Rather,
_1^2=1 2 (+_0) &,&

_2^2=1 2 (&,&
 
_1^2+_2^2= &,&

_0^2+_3^2= &.&Notice also that
[_i,_j]_+=0 , i,j=1,2,3, ij .
From now on by  we will mean a representation of .

The relations ()-() contain spectral information.
From () we see that
-1_01 ,
where the inequality means that the eigenvalues of  are
accordingly bounded. By (), this implies that the eigenvalues
of  are similarly bounded.

We now discuss three cases associated with ().

Case 1  . Call the subspace where 
 as . On ,  and
 by (-). This is subspace of
the top modes of the operator .

Case 2  . Call the
subspace where  as . On , 
 and
 by (-). This is the
subspace of zero modes of the Dirac operator .

Case 3  .  Call the subspace where 
 as . On this subspace,   for
 by (-), and therefore  
sign_i=_i _i  ,_i=positive square root of  _i^2
are well defined and by () generate a 
 Clifford algebra on : 
[sign_i,sign_j]_+=2_ij  .
Consider . It anticommutes with  and . Also
_2=(_V+_V_+1  +_V_-1  )_2 ,
where the subscripts refer to the subspaces over which the trace is taken.
These traces can be calculated:
_V_2&=&_V(sign_i)_2(sign_i)
(i fixed,  2) 

&=&-_V_2by  ()

&=&0,     
           
_V_+1  _2&=&0,as  _2=0  on  
V_+1  .
 So
_2=_V_-1  _2=_V_-1  (1+_2 2 -
1-_2 2 )= index of  _1 .
Following Fujikawa, we can use  as the
generator of chiral transformations. It is not involutive on 


_2^2=+_0 2  .
But this is not a problem for fuzzy physics. In the fuzzy model below,
in the continuum limit,  on all states with 
 a fixed 'energy'  independent of  (and is  on 
where ). We can see this as follows. , so that if
 as . Hence by
(,),  and 
on these levels.

There are of course states, such as those of , on which
 does not go to  as . But their (Euclidean)
energy diverges and their contribution to functional integrals
vanishes in the continuum limit.

We can interpret () as follows. The chiral charge of
levels with  gets renormalized in fuzzy physics. For levels
with , this renormalization vanishes in the naive
continuum limit.

We note that the last feature is positive: it resolves a problem in
previous work, where all the top modes had to be projected
out because of insistence that chirality squares to  on ;
see below.

For Dirac operators of maximum symmetry,  is a function of
the conserved total angular momentum  as we shall show. It
increases with  so that  consists of states of
maximum . This maximum value diverges as  as the
general argument above shows.


 Fuzzy models 
 The Basic Algebra. 

The algebra for the fuzzy sphere characterized by cut-off  is the 
full matrix
algebra  of  matrices. On
, the  Lie algebra acts either on the left or on the
right. Call the operators for left action as  and for right
action as . We have
L^L_ia=L_i a  ,  L^R_ia=aL_i  ,  aM_2L+1  , [L_i^L,L_j^L]=i_ijk L^L_k  , [L_i^R,L_j^R]=-i_ijk L^R_k ,
(L_i^L)^2=(L_i^R)^2=L(L+1) ,
where  is the standard matrix for the -th component of the
angular momentum in the the -dimensional irreducible
representation (IRR). The orbital angular momentum which becomes 
 as  is
L _i=L_i^L-L_i^R ,L _ia=[L_i,a] .
As , both  and   approach the unit
vector  with commuting components:
L^L,R  L   
 .7ex
  
 x ,xx=1 ,
[x_i,x_j]=0 .
 labels a point on the sphere  in the continuum limit.


The Fuzzy Dirac Operator (No Instantons or Gauge Fields) 

Consider .  is the
  carrier of the spin  representation of  with generators
   Pauli matrices. We can couple its
  spin  and the angular momentum  of  to the value
  . If  is the corresponding projector, then
 L^L+1/2 L+1/2   .
 is a self-adjoint involution,
^*=,^2=  .
There is likewise the projector  coupling the spin
 of  and the right angular momentum  to
, where
-L^R+1/2 L+1/2 =,. 
 The algebra  is generated by  and .

The fuzzy Dirac operator of Grosse et al. is
D=1 a (+2 a _1=(L^L-L^R)+1 ,a=1 L+1/2  .
Thus the Dirac operator is in this case  an element of the Ginsparg-Wilson 
algebra .

We can calculate  in terms of :
_0=a^2 2 [J^2-2L(L+1)-1 4 ] .
Thus the eigenvalues of  increase monotonically with the
eigenvalues  of  starting with a minimum for 
and attaining a maximum of  for .

 is the chirality. It anticommutes with . For fixed , as
,  and  as expected. 
In fact,  in the naive continuum limit  is the 
standard chirality for fixed . As 
.
As mentioned earlier, use of  as chirality resolves a difficulty
addressed elsewhere, where  was
used as chirality. That necessitates projecting out  and creates
a very inelegant situation.

Finally we note that there is a simple reconstruction of 
 and  
from their continuum limits. If  is not normalized, 


.
As  can be represented by  or  in fuzzy physics,
natural choices for  and  are 
and . The first operator is  on vectors having
 and  if instead . 
But if , then 
, while if 
 , 
.  is  on former states and  on latter states.
Thus
sign(L^L)= ,
and similarly 
sign(L^R)=-.
We omit the calculation of the spectrum of  as it has been done before,
see and references there. We emphasize that
this spectrum agrees completely with the spectrum of the continuum
Dirac operator, except at the  level.

The Fuzzy Gauged Dirac Operator (No Instanton Fields) 

We adopt the convention that gauge fields are built from operators on
 which act by left multiplication. For  gauge theory,
we start from . 
The fuzzy gauge fields 
are  matrices  where each entry is the operator
of left-multiplication by  on . 
thus acts on  according to
(A_i^L)_m=(A_i)_mn _n .
The gauge-covariant derivative is then
_i(A^L)=L _i+A^L_i=L_i^L-L_i^R+A_i^L .
Note how only the left angular momentum is augmented by a gauge field.

The hermiticity condition on  is 
(A^L_i)^*=A^L_i ,
where
((A^L_i)^*)_m=(A^*_i)_nm _n ,
 being hermitean conjugate of .

The corresponding field strength  is defined by
[(L+A)^L_i,(L+A)^L_j]=i_ijk (L+A)^L_k+iF_ij  .
There is a further point to attend to. We need a gauge-invariant condition
which in the continuum limit eliminates the component of  normal
to . There are different such conditions, the following simple one
being due to:
(L^L_i+A^L_i)^2=(L^L_i)^2=L(L+1) .
This is gauge invariant. For large  it gives
[x^L_i,A^L_i]_+ + (A^L_i)^2 L =0 .
 is to remain bounded as . Also , the
unit normal to the sphere at . So in the limit, if 
, as required.


The Ginsparg-Wilson system can be introduced as follows. As  squares
to , there are no zero modes for  and hence for 
. By continuity, for generic , its
gauged version  also has no zero
modes. Hence we can set 
(A^L)=(L^L+A^L)+1/2 
(L^L+A^L)+1/2  ,(A^L)^*=(A^L) ,(A^L)^2= .
It is the gauged involution which reduces to  for
zero .

As for the second involution , we can set
On following (-), these idempotents generate the
Ginsparg-Wilson algebra with operators , where
. 

The operators  do not individually have continuum 
limits as their
squares  diverge as . In contrast  and
 do have continuum limits. This was remarked earlier on for the
latter, while  just becomes orbital angular momentum. 

To see more precisely how  , the Dirac operator for gauge field 
, (
being  of ()), and  , behave in the 
continuum limit, we note that from (),() 
((L^L+A^L)+1 2 )^2=
(L+1 2 )^2 - 1 2 _ijk _iF_ij  ,
and therefore we have the expansions 
1 (L^L+A^L)+1 2  
=2  _0^dse^-s^2
((L^L+A^L)+1 2 )^2 =1 L+1 2  

+1 4(L+1 2 )^3 _ijk _iF_jk +...,
D(A^L)&=&(2L+1)_1(A^L)=
(L^L-L^R+A^L)+1 +
(L^L+A^L)+1 2  4(L+1 2 )^2 
_ijk _kF_ij +..   

_2(A^L)&=&(L^L+A^L)+1 2  
2(L+1 2  ) -
-L^R+1 2  2(L+1 2 ) 
+(L^L+A^L)+1 2  8(L+1 2 )^3 
_ijk _kF_ij +... .

So in the continuum limit,
 ,
and , exactly as we want.

It is remarkable that even in the presence of gauge field, there is the 
operator
_0(A^L)=1 2 [(A^L),A^L)]_+
which is in the centre of . It assumes the role of  in the
presence of . In the continuum limit, it has the following 
meaning.
With  denoting the Dirac operator for gauge field , (
being  of ()),  and  
generate
a Clifford algebra in that limit and the Hilbert space splits into a direct sum
of subspaces, each carrying its IRR.  is a label for these 
subspaces.


The Basic Instanton Coupling 

The instanton sectors on  correspond to  bundles thereon.
The connection on these bundles is not unique. Those with maximum
symmetry have a particular simplicity and are therefore important 
for analysis.

In a similar way, on , there are projective modules which in the
algebraic approach substitute for sections of bundles 
. 
There are particular connections on these modules
with maximum symmetry and simplicity. In this section we build the 
Ginsparg-Wilson system for such connections. The Dirac operator then is
also simple. It has zero modes which are responsible for the axial anomaly.
Their presence will also be shown by simple reasoning.

To build the projective module for Chern number  introduce 
 carrying the angular momentum  representation of 
. Let  be the angular momentum operators in
this representation with standard commutation relations. Let
. We let 
be the projector coupling left angular momentum operators  with
 to produce maximum angular momentum . Then the projective module 
 is the fuzzy analogue of sections of  
bundles on  with Chern number . If instead we 
couple  and  to produce the least angular momentum 
 using the projector
,  corresponds to Chern number  (we
assume that ).
 
We go about as follows to set up the Ginsparg-Wilson system. For 
we now choose
^(L^L+T)+1/2 LT+1/2 
 
 The domain of  is
 with  acting on 
. On this module  
and . 

As for , we choose it to be the same as in eq.().

 and  generate the new Ginsparg-Wilson system. 
The operators
 are defined as before as also the new Dirac operator 
. 

Mixing of Spin and Isospin 

The total angular momentum  which commutes with 
and hence acts on
  is not
, but .

The addition of  here is the algebraic analogue
of the 'mixing of spin and isospin'. Such a term is essential
in  since , not commuting with
, would not preserve the modules. 
It is interesting that a mixing 
of 'spin and isospin' occurs already in our finite-dimensional matrix model
and does not need noncompact spatial slices and spontaneous symmetry
breaking.

 The Spectrum of the Dirac operator 

We can solve for the spectrum of  and  from that of
. It is determined by the
spectrum of , which can be found from angular momentum addition.
 and 
commute mutually and with
 and . But  has the fixed values 
 on our modules, and the eigenvalues of the remaining
 three operators can be used to label the eigenstates. 
We can write the latter
as , where:
(L^L+T)^2^(LT) _j,j_3 (L+s)&=&
(LT)(LT+1)^(LT) _j,j_3 (L+s) ,

(-L^R+/2)^2^(LT) _j,j_3 (L+s)&=&
(L+ s)(L+s+1)^(LT) _j,j_3 (L+s) , s=1/2, L1/2 

J^2^(LT) _j,j_3 (L+s)&=&
j(j+1)^(LT) _j,j_3 (L+s) , jTs,,
LT+s  

J_3^(LT) _j,j_3 (L+s)&=&j_3
^(LT) _j,j_3 (L+s) .
These  are eigenstates of :
_0^(LT) _j,j_3 (L+s)=_0^(LT) (j)
^(LT) _j,j_3 (L+s) , _0^(LT) (j)=1 2(LT+
1 2 )(L+1 2 ) [j(j+1)-(LT)(LT+1)-L(L+1)-1 4 ]
Now from ()
_1^2^(LT) _j,j_3 (L+s)=_1^(LT) (j)^2
^(LT) _j,j_3 (L+s) ,_1^(LT) (j)^2=
1 2 [1+_0^(LT) (j)] .
So
[_1+_1^(LT) (j)][_1-_1^(LT) (j)]
^(LT) _j,j_3 (L+s)=0 .
There are three cases to be considered here:

a) .

In this case, from(), we get
j= 2LT+1 2   .
This is the maximum total angular possible in these modules. For this
 and there is no degeneracy of eigenstates on
fixing  as well. Also, we can see that  as follows.
From section 2, if  and 
. Hence  and 
 are  for this . Thus
_1_2LT+1/2,j_3 ^(LT) (L+1 2 )=
_2LT+1/2,j_3 ^(LT) (L+1 2 ) .
b) .

In this case, by section 2, none of the operators  vanish,
in particular . Hence by () and section 2, 
either 
_1^(LT) _j,j_3 (L+s)=_1^(LT) 
^(LT) _j,j_3 (L+s) ,
and
_1_2^(LT) _j,j_3 (L+s)=
-_1^(LT) ^(LT) _j,j_3 (L+s)
or 
(_1-_1^(LT) (j))
^(LT) _j,j_3 (L+s)0
and
_1(_1-_1^(LT) (j))^(LT) _j,j_3 (L+s)
&=&-_1^(LT) (j)
(_1-_1^(LT) (j))^(LT) _j,j_3 (L+s) ,

_1_2(_1-_1^(LT) (j))
^(LT) _j,j_3 (L+s)
&=& _1^(LT) (j)_2
(_1-_1^(LT) (j))^(LT) _j,j_3 (L+s) .


As  preserves  (and has no null state in this case),
we have thus found two eigenstates of
 for fixed . But the vector space for fixed  and 
 has dimension 2. 
This we can see as follows. Vectors
with fixed  come from combining  and , and 
 and . All  occur both 
in the former and in 
the latter, and just once in either case. They are thus two-fold degenerate.
But  for  
and is zero only for 
(we assume ). This proves that these eigenstates are of
dimension 2. But we have found the two eigenvectors for
.
So we have found all eigenvectors of  and  for
non-zero eigenvalues.

c) . 

In this case, , and .
Also, the null space of
 is of dimension , the dimension required by
index theorem and (integrated) axial anomaly
. We can see this as follows. As  on
this subspace, , and .
Now, by section 3,  are the projectors giving
. For 
, as  can combine only with  to produce
,  is coming from
. Hence , or
these null states of  are left-chiral and  in number.
This module has no
right-chiral null states. For , in the
same way  the null states are right-chiral and also  in number. 
These are the results
needed by continuum index theory and axial anomaly.

We show below that the above axial anomaly on  is stable
against perturbations compatible with the chiral properties of the
Dirac operator, and is hence a 'topological' invariant.


 Gauging the Dirac Operator in Instanton Sectors 

The operator  commutes with 
and hence preserves the projective modules. It is important to
preserve this feature on gauging as well. So the gauge field 
 is taken to be a function of  (which remains
bounded as ). For , it becomes a function of
. The limiting transversality of  can be
guaranteed by imposing the condition 

(L^L+T+A^L)^2=(L^L+T)^2=(LT)(LT+1) ,

which generalizes ().

We can now construct the Ginsparg-Wilson system using
(A^L)=(L^L+T+A^L)+1/2 
(L^L+T+A^L)+1/2 
 and the  of (),  being  of 
().  has no zero modes,
 and therefore () is well-defined for generic . We
 can now use section 2 to construct the Dirac theory. 

We have a continous number of Ginsparg-Wilson algebras labeled by
. For each, () holds:
_2(A^L)=n(A^L) .
Here as , it is in fact a constant by
continuity. The index of the Dirac operator and the axial anomaly ()
are thus independent of  as previously indicated.

The  expansions (-) are easily extended
to the instanton sectors, and imply
the continuum limit of  and chirality



D^(LT) (A^L) && (L +T+A)+ 1 ,

 _2(A^L) &&  x .
 Chirality is thus independent of the gauge field  in the limiting
 case, but not otherwise.


Remarks .

The Ginsparg-Wilson system developed above can be generalized to any
number of products of . For example consider  
. Its algebra is , where
 and  can differ. There is a Ginsparg-Wilson system for each
factor with its  and . Denote them (with or without
instantons and/or gauge fields) by 
and . The  and  for 
 are

(1)+_3(1)(2) 1+_3(1)^2  &,&1+_3(2)^2   ,

_3(1)=1 2 [(1),&,&
_3(2)=1 2 [(2),.
They square to unity since 
Since the denominators in () commute with the operators in
the numerators, there is no ordering problem in these equations.

Generalizations of the present investigation to fuzzy spaces such as
 await future work.

We have already treated integrated -anomaly. Its local form
has not been treated in the present approach, see however
. As for gauge anomalies, the central and
familiar problem is that noncommutative algebras allow gauging only
by the particular groups , and that too by their particular
representations. This is so in a naive approach. There
are clever methods to overcome this problem on the Moyal planesusing the Seiberg-Witten map, but they too have failed
us for the fuzzy spaces. Thus gauge anomalies can be studied for fuzzy
spaces only in a very limited manner, but even this is yet to be
done. More elaborate issues like anomaly cancellation in a fuzzy
version of the standard model have to wait till the above mentioned
problem is solved.

At the end of section 3.1 I would add a phrase to say that the spectrum 
one obtains agrees perfectly with the continuum one (except the 
 bit). I would like to say that the same applies in the 
instanton sector, except that I can't find  Bassetto and Griguolo
J.Math.Phys. 32 (1991) 3195 in the mess of my papers. 

I have made the additions we discussed in section 3.3. Not much prose,
but I think it is enough. An even more restrained touch up was applied
at the end of section 5 (gauged operator in the instatnton sector).

Please, see if you can reconstruct the missing text just before the 
beginning of section 4.1, I cannot find it.

I have completed the bibliography, as well as I could,
 but I don't have the titles of some
of the old papers. Of course I could omit the titles altogether, although
I like having them. I also miss the Wess reference (which one is it? just 
tell me where it would be quoted). On reflection, I admit that giving all 
the titles in such a short paper
makes the lenght of the bibliography somewhat disproportionate; if you
 agree, I shall wipe them out at the next instalment..
