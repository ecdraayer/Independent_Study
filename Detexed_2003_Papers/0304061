We consider four-dimensional  supersymmetric gauge
theories with gauge group  on , in the
presence of a classical superpotential. The low-energy quantum
superpotential is obtained by simply replacing the adjoint scalar
superfield in the classical superpotential by the Lax matrix of
the integrable system that underlies the 4d field theory. We
verify in a number of examples that the vacuum structure obtained
in this way matches precisely that in 4d, although the degrees of
freedom that appear are quite distinct. Several features of 4d
field theories, such as the possibility of lifting vacua from
 to , become particularly simple in this framework.
It turns out that supersymmetric vacua give rise to a reduction of
the integrable system which contains information about the field
theory but also about the Dijkgraaf-Vafa matrix model. The
relation between the matrix model and the quantum superpotential
on  appears to involve a novel kind of mirror
symmetry.



Introduction 

The dynamics of supersymmetric gauge theories mimics in many ways that
of ordinary QCD, allowing for instance for confinement and chiral symmetry
breaking. Therefore, if we would have exact control over supersymmetric
theories, we could imagine describing non-supersymmetric gauge theories
as a perturbation away from a supersymmetric point, rather than as a perturbation
around a free field theory. In view of the qualitative similarity of the
low-energy dynamics, such a description could be much better behaved than ordinary
perturbation theory. In addition, there are several indications that
supersymmetry will be restored at sufficiently high energies, and this
provides ample motivation for the study of supersymmetric gauge theories.

As a first step towards the complete understanding of supersymmetric gauge
theories, one would like to understand their vacuum structure. A simple
organizing principle to describe the vacuum structure, low-energy gauge
couplings and correlation functions of chiral operators was given by Dijkgraaf
and Vafa in. This organizing principle involves a matrix model
which is obtained from the classical superpotential by reducing it to
its zero modes. The sum over the planar diagrams of the matrix model computes
the quantum superpotential as a function of gluino condensate superfields
, one for each semisimple gauge group factor that is left unbroken
by a choice of minimum of the classical superpotential. Though this result
was originally derived using topological string theory, one can give
a proof of it directly in perturbation theory, or alternatively
using the Konishi anomaly.

The matrix model, which was originally found for a pure 
theory deformed by a superpotential ,
has been successfully generalized to a variety of other
supersymmetric gauge theories. There are, however, still several
conceptual questions that remain. One of these is whether and why
the gluino condensate superfields play such a distinguished role. It is
true, as has been elaborated in, that they effectively control
the complete chiral ring of the gauge theory, but whether they are also
the sufficient and appropriate degrees of freedom for a full low-energy
effective description remains unknown. The precise reason for the
appearance of the Veneziano-Yankielowicz superpotential
 remains somewhat mysterious as well,
though in the matrix model it can be interpreted in terms of the measure.
Another question is whether the matrix model approach, or a suitable modification
thereof, is applicable to all possible gauge theories with all possible matter
content. One may also wonder whether the integrable system that underlies
the matrix model has any relation to the integrable system that underlies
 gauge theories.

In an attempt to shed light on some of these issues, we consider in this
paper pure  theories with superpotential 
compactified on a circle with radius . The integrable system that underlies
the four-dimensional theory becomes much more prominent once the theory
is compactified on a circle, and in addition the low-energy degrees
of freedom are quite distinct. Therefore, we should obtain an interesting
perspective on the matrix model results by compactifying the four-dimensional
theories.

The compactification of the pure   theory was discussed in
detail in. Recall that in four dimensions there is a -dimensional
moduli space, and at each point in the moduli space there is an
auxiliary Riemann surface known as the Seiberg-Witten curve 
 (for
a review see e.g.). The low-energy gauge couplings are
given by the periods of the Seiberg-Witten curve, or in other words by
the complex structure of the Jacobian of the curve, which is a -dimensional
torus. Once the theory is compactified, the moduli space becomes
-dimensional. The extra moduli come from the four-dimensional gauge field.
The component of the gauge field along the circle is a scalar from the
three-dimensional point of view, and the remaining 3d gauge field can
be dualized to a second scalar. Thus, each  gauge field gives rise
to two real scalars, that combine into one chiral superfield. The expectation
values of these scalars provide the extra moduli. Since the low-energy
gauge couplings were given by the complex structure of the Jacobian,
it should come as no surprise that the moduli space of the compactified
theory is obtained by adding to each point in
the moduli space of the uncompactified theory
the Jacobian of the associated Seiberg-Witten curve. Altogether the moduli
space is a -dimensional hyperKahler manifold. According to,
it has a distinguished complex structure that is independent of the
radius  of the circle. Therefore, after including a superpotential,
the holomorphic data (such as the value of the superpotential and
the vacuum structure) will be independent of the radius . This crucial
fact shows that we should be able to recover the four-dimensional
results directly for finite , without the need to take the limit
.

In several ways, life simplifies in the presence of a circle. First of all, 
the non-perturbative dynamics of the three-dimensional theories we consider here
does not involve fractional
instantons, but only regular 3d instantons (which are monopoles
from the 4d point of view). Second of all, there are no degrees of freedom
that become light anywhere on the moduli space. In four dimensions, there
are massless monopoles and dyons on the moduli space, and these play a
crucial role in the quantum physics. In the presence of a superpotential,
some of these degrees of freedom condense, and this mechanism is responsible
for the existence of supersymmetric vacua. Once the compact
circle is introduced, there are no such massless degrees of freedom for the theories
we consider, and
we therefore expect that the classical superpotential is actually identical
to the quantum superpotential. The only issue is to find the right variables
in which to express the superpotential. These variables are provided by
the underlying integrable system, which in the case of  is the periodic
Toda chain, and whose phase space coincides with the moduli space of the
unperturbed theory. Indeed, we will find that if the classical superpotential
is , the quantum superpotential is simply ,
with  the Lax matrix of the integrable system, if the order of  is
not too large. This was first conjectured in, where
it is also shown that this correctly produces several 4d vacua in the
case of a mass deformation of the 4d  theory, and it was
explained intuitively in. The validity of this conjecture
for massive (i.e. maximally confining) vacua for theories with higher
order superpotentials was demonstrated in.

In this paper we will analyze the minima and other properties
of the quantum superpotential  for arbitrary
superpotentials  and gauge groups . We will consider both
massless and massive vacua. We will find that the vacuum structure
is in complete agreement with the results obtained in four dimensions,
in a series of examples. A general proof, using the integrable hierarchy
of the periodic Toda chain, will be described in a separate publication
. Several features of the 4d theory have a simple
interpretation on . Massive vacua correspond to
simple degenerate Lax matrices, lifting vacua from  to
 corresponds to applying a simple replica procedure to the
Lax matrix, etc. We also discuss the semiclassical expansion on
, and the interpretation of the gluino condensate
superfields. The combination  has a simple interpretation
as a Lagrange multiplier in three dimensions, but the interpretation
of the individual  remains unclear, and seems to involve a new version
of mirror symmetry.

The outline of this paper is as follows.
In section 2 we discuss some background material, such as general
properties of  theories in three dimensions, and
the vacuum structure in the absence and presence of a superpotential.
In section 3 we describe the general conjecture and explain qualitatively
why we expect it to be correct. In section 4 we discuss several examples
and show that there is perfect agreement with the results obtained in
four dimensions. In section 5 we discuss the semiclassical expansion,
and in section 6 the relation with the integrable hierarchy of the
periodic Toda chain. Supersymmetric minima determine a specific reduction
of the hierarchy that is remarkably similar to the four-dimensional
field theory expressions, and at the same time remarkably similar to
the integrable system that underlies the Dijkgraaf-Vafa matrix model.
In section 7 we discuss the interpretation of the gluino bilinear superfields
, and finally we present some puzzles and open problems.

Field theory background material 

 theories in  

A pure  theory with gauge group  in four dimensions
has as bosonic fields a scalar field 
transforming in the adjoint representation which is part of an 
hypermultiplet, and a gauge field  which is part of an 
vector multiplet. In a classical minimum of the scalar potential we can always diagonalize
,
= (   ) .
Such a value of  generically breaks the  gauge group to
, but the Weyl group  also remains unbroken. Because
of the action of the Weyl group, only symmetric polynomials in the 
are gauge invariant objects, and as a basis of these polynomials we
can choose either  with , or alternatively
the coefficients in the characteristic polynomial,
P_N(x) & & (x - ) 

 & & x^N + s_1 x^N-1  + s_N .
Classically, the moduli space is parametrized by the values of the , and
generically the gauge group is broken to , but at special points
some of the non-abelian gauge symmetry is restored. The quantum theory was
first understood for  in the famous paper of Seiberg and Witten
, and later generalized to and studied for many other gauge
theories. 
For a review see e.g.. It turns out that the
quantum moduli space is still parametrized by complex coordinates ,
but there are no longer points where a non-abelian gauge symmetry is
restored. Instead, there are special points in the moduli space where
dyons and/or monopoles can become massless. For each point on the moduli
space one can define an auxiliary curve, the Seiberg-Witten curve,
given by
y^2 = P^2_N(x) - 4 ^2N 
whose periods determine the gauge couplings of the low-energy effective
theory. The curve () describes a double cover of the complex
-plane, with  the dynamically generated scale of the 
theory. The classical limit corresponds to taking the limit
. The curve () has a Jacobian ,
which is a complex torus with period matrix ,
where  is a standard basis of one-cycles
on the curve, and  form basis of holomorphic one-forms normalized
so that .
Massless monopoles and/or dyons appear whenever the curve ()
degenerates, i.e. some of the one-cycles collapse.

 deformations in  

Next, we consider what happens when we add a superpotential
d^4 x d^2 Tr  W()
with
W() = _m=0 ^n g_m+1  m+1  ^m+1 
some polynomial of the superfield . Classically, the equation
W'() g_n+1 (= 0,
must hold and therefore each of the eigenvalues  of  in equation ()
needs to be equal to one of the . Thus the moduli space is reduced to
a finite set of points, where at least a  gauge symmetry remains
unbroken. More precisely, if  is occupied  times, in other words
 of the  are equal to , then the gauge symmetry is broken
to
U(N) U(N_1) U(N_n) .
In the quantum theory, the pure  theories with gauge group
 that appear classically confine, a nonzero gluino condensate
 appears, and the gauge group is
broken to  (for ). One can also show that necessarily some
monopoles/dyons in the  theory have to condense. Thus the breaking
pattern of the gauge symmetry is
U(N) classical   
U(N_1) U(N_n) quantum   
U(1)^k
where  is the number of  that are not equal to zero.

There are several approaches known in the literature to understanding 
the quantum theory. The first studies use Seiberg duality.
The precise structure of the vacua can be obtained 
using a brane construction, one can use pure field theory
methods, one can use Calabi-Yau geometry and geometric
engineering, one can use matrix models and one
can use the generalized Konishi anomaly. For our purposes,
we will be mainly interested in a comparison to the vacuum structure as
obtained using field theory methods. The field theory results can be
summarized as follows:
 
First, express the quantities  in terms of
the  that appear in ().
Next, determine the submanifold of the  theory on
which there are at least  mutually local massless monopoles/dyons. On this
submanifold, the Seiberg-Witten curve degenerates and can be written in
the form
y^2 = P_N^2(x)- 4 ^2N  = H^2_N-k (x) T_2k (x)
for some polynomials  of degrees ,  respectively. As can
be seen from (),  one-cycles have collapsed.
Minimize the classical superpotential, expressed in terms of the ,
on this submanifold. The resulting extrema are the quantum vacua.
One can then show that the quantum vacua are in one-to-one
correspondence with points on the moduli space where in addition to
() we also have
G^2_n-k (x) T_2k (x) = W'(x)^2 + f_n-1 (x)
for some polynomials  of degrees , and where  is the same
polynomial that appears in (). Equation () can
be viewed as a degeneration of the matrix model curve.
Finally, we need to check that the classical limit
of  is indeed , so that it indeed is a quantum
vacuum corresponding to the appropriate classical vacuum.

For future reference, we also briefly summarize the matrix model approach
of. Their construction starts with the matrix integral
de^-1 g^2  Tr  W() .
The symbol  now denotes an  matrix. Next we consider the planar
diagrams in perturbation theory around a classical minimum where
. The free energy, 
that is the sum of the connected planar diagrams, is a function of
the  and denoted by . Next, we replace
 by  to construct a function .
With this definition of  the quantum superpotential 
for the  theory with classical superpotential  in a 
minimum where classically  is broken to 
 is then
W_eff   = _i N_i F  S_i  + 
  _i S_i  .
The  are superfields whose lowest components are the gaugino condensates
. This quantum superpotential controls
the complete chiral ring of the  theory and contains in that
sense more information then the field theory result given above. The
field theory results only describe the minima of () and
are therefore recovered by minimizing () with respect to the .

A subtlety in () is the inclusion of the Veneziano-Yankielowicz
superpotential 
W^(N_i) _VY (S_i) = S_i [ ( ^3N_i  S_i^N_i  
) + N_i ] 
for each of the classical unbroken gauge groups . 
This can be attributed to the measure in the matrix model.
 For a pure  superpotential, () is the full
quantum superpotential and its minima are at 
with  and .

Having reviewed the situation in four dimensions, we now turn to 
compactifications to three dimensions. 

 theories in  

Three-dimensional theories with  can be obtained by dimensionally
reducing four-dimensional theories with . The structure of the 
Coulomb branch of such theories was studied in detail 
in, and they exhibit a
rich set of physical phenomena such as mirror symmetry.
Under the dimensional
reduction, the four-dimensional vector field  decomposes in one
scalar field  and a three dimensional vector field . The 
three-dimensional vector can in turn be dualized to a second scalar via
.
The two scalars combine into a complex scalar , which is part of a 3d 
hypermultiplet. Thus, in three dimensions, the vector multiplet is dual
to a hypermultiplet. This duality can be performed directly in the
Lagrangian for abelian gauge groups (see e.g.), but not
for non-abelian groups, similar to what happens with electric-magnetic
duality in four dimensions. If we dimensionally reduce from four to
three dimensions,  will be a periodic variable, but  is
unconstrained. If we instead compactify on a circle to go from four
to three dimensions, both  and  are periodic variables. 

Classically, the complex variable  is , and the action
only depends on , where  is the superfield with lowest component
. In perturbation theory the action remains a function of  only,
but the relation between the vev of ,  and  can become
quite complicated. The periodicity of  and  is therefore not
always manifest in terms of . For example,  could be a coordinate
on a torus in Weierstrass form , but the fact that
this is a torus is not manifest. Non-perturbatively, the action no
longer needs to be a function of , as instantons generate a 
non-trivial dependence on the zero mode of .

The compactification of a pure  theory on 
yields a three-dimensional theory with a moduli space which is parametrized
by the vevs of  and . The gauge symmetry is broken everywhere
to , and both  and  are diagonal. The moduli space is
a hyperKahler manifold of dimension , and contains the moduli
space of the four-dimensional theory that was parametrized only by
. What we gain by going to three dimensions are the vevs of ,
and these parametrize a -torus, which can be identified with the
Jacobian of the Seiberg-Witten curve. According to, one
of the complex structures of the moduli space is independent of the
radius , and this complex structure is the one that will be relevant
once we break to  in . Since it is independent of
, the vacuum structure we find in three dimensions should be directly
related to the vacuum structure in four dimensions.

 deformations in  

In this section we consider what happens when we add a superpotential
d^3 x d^2 Tr  W()
with
W() = _m=0 ^n g_m+1  m+1  ^m+1 .
In four dimensions the gauge symmetry was broken according to
(), and since the complex structure of the moduli
space did not depend on , we expect that for every finite value
of  this remains true. Therefore, we expect that the moduli space
collapses to a finite collection of tori of dimension .

One of the main questions that we would like to answer in this paper
is whether this is indeed true, and whether this can all be described using
a suitable low-energy effective superpotential that depends on a suitable
set of degrees of freedom. This can indeed be done, but to understand
the result we first need to review some aspects of nonperturbative physics
in three-dimensional gauge theories. 

Non-perturbative physics in three dimensions is due to three-dimensional
instantons, which from the four dimensional point of view are monopoles. 
They are classified by . Indeed, for
each simple root there is a corresponding embedding , 
and for each such embedding there is a corresponding elementary monopole.
A general monopole configuration is therefore labeled by a set of integers
, counting the number of elementary monopole 
constituents. In a pure  theory in three dimensions,
one can count the number of gaugino zero modes in a general monopole
background using the Callias index theorem, and one
finds that there are two zero modes only if one  and all other
 vanish. We need two fermionic zero modes in order to get a non-trivial
contribution to the superpotential, and therefore only the single elementary
monopoles contribute to superpotential. Their contribution can be explicitly evaluated and the final result for
the superpotential readsW_quantum  = e^(Z_1-Z_2)/g_3^2  + e^(Z_2-Z_3)/g_3^2  + +
 e^(Z_N-1 -Z_N )/g_3^2 .
Here,  represents the diagonal entries of , and in the exponents
one recognizes the simple roots of ;  is the three-dimensional
Yang-Mills coupling. The result () is exact, and shows runaway
behavior. In a sense, () is less subtle than the Veneziano-Yankielowicz
effective superpotential (), because () involves a sum
of ordinary instantons, and fractional instantons play no role. The situation
in the presence of matter is quite a bit more subtle and is discussed in
e.g.. 

 deformations on  

Now we examine what happens if the  theory is put on .
In addition to the monopoles that contributed to (), there
is one more non-trivial gauge field configuration that contributes,
which is the Kaluza-Klein monopole. This is present due to the existence
of large gauge transformations along the .

The KK monopole adds one extra contribution to (), and it
becomesW_quantum =e^(Z_1-Z_2)/g_3^2  ++e^(Z_N-1 -Z_N )/g_3^2  +
e^-1/Rg_3^2  e^(Z_N-Z_1)/g_3^2  .
The three-dimensional answer is recovered by taking ,
whereas the decompactification limit is  while
keeping the dynamical scale
^3N e^-1/g_4^2  e^-1/Rg_3^2 
fixed.

In order to study the minima of (), and in order to compare
to the results we will find later, we first introduce a different set
of variables
y_1 & = & e^(Z_1-Z_2)/g_3^2  

& & 

y_N-1  & = & e^(Z_N-1 -Z_N )/g_3^2  

y_0 & = & e^-1/Rg_3^2  e^(Z_N-Z_1)/g_3^2  .
The variables  are not unconstrained but obey
_i=0 ^N-1  y_i = ^3N .
To impose this constraint, we introduce a Lagrange multiplier field
, and with this field the superpotential () can be rewritten
as
W_quantum  = y_1 + + y_N-1  +y_0 + L ( ^3N  
_i=0 ^N-1  y_i   ) .
The minima of () are easily found, they are
y_i,min   = L_min  = ^3 e^2i t/N , W_min  = N^3 e^2i t/N .
Indeed, the dependence on  has dropped out of () and
(), and the results are identical to the results obtained
from the Veneziano-Yankielowicz superpotential (). 

Before discussing the general case, we discuss the simplest deformation of 
an  theory to a  theory, namely by a mass term
. In the presence of such a mass term,
there is a pure  theory at low energies, whose 
scale  is related to the high energy  
scale  via scale matching as
^3  = m ^2 .
If we substitute this in (), and redefine ,
the superpotential becomes
W = m _i=0 ^N-1  y_i + L ( ^2N  
_i=0 ^N-1  y_i   ) .
The extrema of this superpotential are as before, we merely made a change
of variables. The superpotential () only contains gauge degrees
of freedom, but we could also have chosen to include the diagonal
entries of  in the superpotential. They would simply appear
through an extra mass term,
W = m _i=0 ^N-1  y_i + L ( ^2N  
_i=0 ^N-1  y_i   ) + 1 2  m _i=0 ^N-1  _i^2.
The minima of () are the same as before, as  at the 
extremum. As we will see, () is literally the superpotential
we obtain if we evaluate , with  the Lax
matrix of the periodic Toda chain. In general, we will find a superpotential which is a function
of  and , where the  are subject to .

The proposal 

We now turn to deformations involving a general superpotential
 on . 
As explained in the introduction, since there are no new massless
degrees of freedom on the moduli space, all we need to do is
to figure out how to write the operators  in terms
of suitable holomorphic variables on the -dimensional hyperKahler
moduli space of the unperturbed theory. The resulting expression should
be the low-energy effective quantum superpotential. 

To find these variables we need to use the fact that the moduli space
is at the same time the phase space of a (complexified) integrable system. 
This integrable system is the periodic Toda chain, and its relation
to the Seiberg-Witten curve and  theories in four dimensions
was found in. The periodic Toda chain is described by
the Hamiltonian 
H = 1 2  _i=1 ^N p_i^2 + ^2 e^q_1-q_2  + +
^2 e^q_N-1 -q_N   + ^2 e^q_N-q_1 
with coordinates  and momenta , and we introduced a parameter 

which will later be identified with a field theory scale. 
Notice the similarity of this
expression to that in (). The dynamics described by the
Hamiltonian () is integrable: there exists a Lax operator
, which is an  matrix and a function of coordinates
and momenta, such that the time evolution given by the Hamiltonian
() can equivalently be described by the equation
M t  = [M,L (M)].
The linear operator  will be described in more detail in section 6.
One of the implications of () is that the variables
 are constants of the equations of
motion. With further work one can also show that they
Poisson commute. They provide a complete set of action variables and
generate commuting flows
M t_k  = M,u_k = [M,L (1 k+1  M^k)]
on the phase space. Thus, the phase space admits action-angle variables, and
the angle variables are linear in the variables . The  provide
a local set of coordinates on the Jacobian of the Seiberg-Witten curve,
and are closely related to gauge transformations (recall that the angular
coordinates that describe the Jacobian were obtained by dualizing the
gauge field). Therefore, it is in many ways natural to identify the
gauge invariant quantities  with the 
conserved quantities  of the dynamical
system. This is also what the original discussion of the role
of the integrable system in  theories in four dimensions 
implies. Therefore, we conjecture, following 
 that the quantum superpotential can be obtained from the classical one by the rule
d^4 x d^2 Tr W() d^4 x d^2 Tr W(M) ,
with  the Lax matrix of the integrable system. In order to
compare this to the field theory discussion in section 2, we need
to explain the relation between the coordinates and momenta
in () and the field theory degrees of freedom that appeared
in our discussion in section 2. That can be done by comparing
the Hamiltonian () to the superpotential ().
According to (), these two should be identified with each other.
Therefore, the momenta  of the integrable system should naturally be
identified with the eigenvalues  of the adjoint superfield 
as in (). Furthermore, the variables  can be identified
with , where the indices on  are 
identified modulo . 

To make the statement in () more explicit, we
need to give the explicit form of the Lax matrix. It is given by
 
can be done for general . Substituting the Lax matrix for the adjoint scalar  into the superpotential gives the following effective superpotential
 
with the equations for the extrema
 
 
 
From the second equation we can learn that the y's are all equal, this enables us to solve for  using the first equation
 
Substituting  into the equation for  yields
 
Further, we also see that all the 's occupy the root 
of 
 
The 's should always occupy the roots of  classically (), but here it is even true in the quantum case.

The superpotential in the extrema is then
 

To compare with field theory results we compute the characteristic polynomial . According to appendix  this is either a Chebyshev polynomial of the first or of the second kind. By evaluating  and  one can see that one has to pick the polynomials of the first kind
 
These  are in perfect agreement with field theory results
 


Maximally confining vacua 


In the previous sections we found all vacua for some simple potentials and small rank of . In this section we consider the simple vacua with  taken to be equal. These are considered for arbitrary  and for polynomial potentials of degree . These vacua are maximally confining. 


The maximally confining vacua of a U(N) theory with superpotential 
  
are obtained by taking all  with , and taking all , where  is such that . 
Because of the tridiagonal form of  this requirement on  is equivalent to the condition  for the coefficient in the Laurent expansion
 
Expressed in terms of the coefficients of the superpotential, the condition  reads
 
with . 
This can be expressed in terms of a hypergeometric function
 

On the other hand, according to () and () 
the factorization of the polynomial  appearing in the spectral curve imposes an apparently different condition on . 
With all  equal,  must have  double zeroes:
  
In this case  is a Chebyshev polynomial: , with . 
Together with the convenient definition of the Chebyshev polynomials of first and second kind
 
this factorization is directly observed
 
So after rescaling one obtains
 
for any maximally confining vacuum, irrespective of the rank of the gauge group.

From the point of view of four dimensional gauge theory, it is expected that  must be related to the superpotential as
 
for some polynomials ,  of degree . 
Equation () can be seen as a set of  conditions that the coefficients of each power of  match. 
Of these conditions  can be satisfied by appropriate choice of coefficients of  and . 
The final remaining condition turns out to be , in (), which relates  and  to the superpotential at criticality.

To see this, examine the conditions that   and  can be found such that () is true.  
As a matter of convenience, we do a field redefinition 
 
such that at criticality the redefined matrix  has  on the diagonal. 
Next a choice of scale is made such that .
With these choices . 
By a substitution 
 
this can be written as a complete square
 
So the entire left hand side of () is a complete square. 

Note that on the r.h.s. of () the coefficients of terms proportional to  and higher powers of  are entirely determined by . 
The polynomial  only serves to match the coefficients of lower powers of . 
Taking the square root of () yields
 
With the  substitution () , noting , it is observed that () implies
 

In order that a polynomial  of degree  exists, the right hand side of () must be divisible by . 
Choosing the  polynomial in  as follows almost guarantees this:
 
Here  denotes the part of the Laurent series of  with strictly negative powers of . 
The right hand side, written as a Laurent series in  is of the form
  
This is divisible by  iff , with  the coefficient of  in the Laurent series of . 
This is exactly the requirement for criticality, with the field redefinition and choice of scale that set  and .  

In fact, a concrete expression for the coefficients of  can be found, keeping  and  explicit.  
In order that () be true, the coefficients of each power of  must match. 
As noted earlier, by choosing  appropriately,  such coefficients can be matched. 
This leaves  coefficients to be matched,  of which can be made to do so by an appropriate choice of  (note the index: this corresponds to an expansion ) . 
In the end there remains a single relation between ,  and the coefficients  which needs to be satisfied for () to be true.

Now let us check that the single non-trivial relation is precisely (). 
Define
 
In terms of  and  the relevant coefficients are
 
The objective is to find coefficients  such that () is true, as far as the coefficients of the powers  to  are concerned. 
That is
 
The coefficients of powers  to  can be matched by appropriate choice of the polynomial  in (). 
So in the end a single nontrivial relation remains, relating ,  and the coefficients of .

The  can be solved one by one, starting from . 
The top two equations in () have a solution 
 
The next  equations are solved by
 
Subsequent 's can be solved one after another because a  with smaller  appears only in coefficients of lower powers of . 
Thus every next condition, on the coefficients of ever lower powers of  is solved by appropriate choice of  with ever lower indices. 
At some point, this process stops, as there is no ; the coefficient of  in  vanishes. 
So in order that the coefficients of  in () match, () must be satisfied with .
Note that this relation is precisely () relating  to  and the coefficients of the superpotential.

Lifting solutions from U(N) to U(tN) 

It is known that supersymmetric vacua of a  gauge theory
with superpotential  can be lifted to supersymmetric vacua of a  gauge
theory with exactly the same superpotential. On the level of the Seiberg-Witten
polynomial, this lifting involves Chebyshev polynomials and a few other 
ingredients. It turns out, as we will show in this section, that it is very simple
to do this at the level of Lax operators. One simply takes  copies of the
Lax operator of  to construct a Lax operator of  that is periodic
in steps of . This new Lax matrix is an extremum for the same superpotential,
and this replica trick therefore provides a very simple picture of how to lift
vacua. To show technically how this works, we start with 
the Lax operator for U(N) 
 
and the corresponding polynomial  in the spectral curve 
 
where the energy scale  sets the condition
 

As explained above, for a U(tN) theory with a superpotential  of degree  a special form of  can be considered so that the analysis can be reduced to that of the U(N) case, with the same superpotential.
This is possible when the entries of  are periodically identified like
 
so that the only non zero entries of  are
 
The condition set by the energy scale is written as
) 
Note in particular that the (physical) energy scale of the  theory should be real. This condition can be satisfied by a family of  different complex valued  in the U(N) theory,  , with  a -th root of unity.


The polynomial  in the spectral curve of  is
 
The determinant can be calculated by considering a gauge equivalent matrix.
By a gauge transformation  can be brought into a form that is invariant under cyclic permutations of order N.
We define
 
then  has factors of  and  democratically distributed over the  and   entries respectively.
 satisfies
 
where







is the matrix that generates a cyclic permutation of order N on tN elements,
.

In case the degree of the superpotential is small enough, , the cyclic invariance, (), ensures that the equations of motion collapse to those of the U(N) theory with the same superpotential.
First, because in  the  and  appear only linearly, derivatives with respect to  and  can be replaced with derivatives with respect to  and 
 
Second, in  the  and  appear only on the diagonal and the superdiagonal respectively
 
the diagonal elements of  each depend on at most  consecutive 's and 's.
Therefore, all equations of motion for  up to  can be both mapped to equations of motion for  to  and these also consistently collapse onto the equations for the first  's.
The same holds for the equations of motion for all 's.
Also the equation of motion for the Lagrange multiplier, () maps to ().

 can be explicitly written as a  matrix of which each entry is itself one of four  matrices
 
The  matrices A, D, and E are of the following form
 

 

 

Because of (), there exists a basis of simultaneous eigenvectors of  and .
The eigenvectors of   fall into  N-dimensional subspaces, each of which is labeled by a different -th root of unity , .
The eigenvalue equation for  is written in a basis of   eigenvectors , with .

For each  the eigenvalue equation  becomes
 
and therefore
 
The U(tN) polynomial reads
 

The polynomials  are by construction independent of .
A convenient choice to evaluate () is to take .
Recall that  is a -th root of unity such that  hits all  different eigenvalues of the  cyclic permutation matrix .
Hence  can be written as
 

The latter expression defines the -th Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind, which is defined as
 
with
 
equation () can also be written as
 
so
 
Thus the periodic ansatz for the  theory yields  times the number of vacua found in the  theory.
The polynomial  in () agrees precisely with what had been
found in field theory in.


U(4) 


We are now in a position to use the techniques of the preceding section to study our final example , again with a cubic superpotential
W=g_1 () + g_2 2  (^2) + g_3 3 
(^3) .
The Lax operator, polynomial , superpotential 
and equations of motion are straightforward generalizations of
(), (), () and (), with
 replaced by . Instead of giving a lengthy
and tedious analysis of the possible solutions of the equations of
motion, we will simply present a solution for each of the critical
points that we expect, based on the knowledge of the possible
solutions in four dimensions. These are given explicitly in
section 3.3 of.

To describe the qualitative form of the solutions, we write
. Classically, each of the  is equal
to either  or . We denote the number of  for
which  by , so that . However, this
does not fully specify the different solutions. For  with a
cubic superpotential, we know that at a minimum 
 has two double zeroes. These double zeroes are
distributed over  and , since
these two factors cannot have a common zero. We denote by
 the number of double zeroes in , so
that .

When all  are equal, with  or , we
have a maximally confining vacuum, and these were already
described in detail in ().

When , we can use the results in ()
to find solutions by lifting solutions in  to . One
easily finds that these solutions have  or
. In addition, they necessarily have
 or
.

However, this does not exhaust all solutions with
. There are also solutions that have
. In addition, we have not yet considered
solutions with  or . It turns out that all
missing solutions are part of one family, that can be described as
follows. First, by an overall rescaling and by shifting  by a
constant we can always choose  so that
W'(x)=x^2+ x ^4 a^3  - a^2,
for some parameter . The solution is then
 
 
& & 
  

L & = & ^4 a 
with  subject to the constraint
(_3+_4)(a^5 + a^3 _3 _4) + _3 _4 ^4
=0 .
As explained in, there are two
classical limits, one is  while keeping 
fixed, the other is  while keeping
 fixed. The first corresponds to 
and , the second to  or .

We have accounted for all vacua that we expect in four
dimensions. One interesting feature of the solutions is that in
the case with , all classical limits have
 and , but there is no solution
whose classical limit obeys  and .
It therefore appears that one should be careful in choosing the
right ordering of the eigenvalues, not all orderings will give
rise to a solution of the quantum equations of motion. This is not
a contradiction, since the choice of Lax matrix breaks the 
symmetry to , and there is no symmetry that arbitrarily
permutes the eigenvalues.

The solution in () has one free parameter, which
corresponds to the extra  that appears when breaking
.


The semi-classical expansion 


In the previous section we presented several examples of superpotentials
and their extrema. The solutions depend in a non-trivial way on ,
and it is important to understand the nature of the semi-classical expansion,
certainly if we want to compare our results to direct field theory 
calculations in three dimensions. A precise understanding of the
semi-classical expansion is probably also important in order to understand
the relation to the 4d description in terms of gluino bilinear superfields,
as we will discuss in section 7.

What is the general structure of the semiclassical expansion that one
would expect to find? In four dimensions in a situation where the
the gauge group is classically broken to  the
effective superpotential explicitly takes the form of a semiclassical
expansion. In addition to the Veneziano-Yankielowicz superpotentials
() for each unbroken , there are many additional terms
coming from the planar diagrams of the matrix model. These are polynomial and
give ultimately rise to an expansion in positive but possibly fractional
powers of . The low-energy scales  of the unbroken
 that appear in
the Veneziano-Yankielowicz superpotential () are obtained by
scale matching and given by
_i^3N_i  = g_n^N_i  ^2N  _ji  (a_j-a_i)^N_i-2N_j ,
with  and  defined in (). 

On , the Veneziano-Yankielowicz superpotential is no longer
appropriate, the relevant superpotential is instead given by ()
or equivalently (). Therefore, we expect that the superpotential
on  should admit an expansion of the form
W = _i _j=0 ^N_i-1  y^(i) _j + higher order terms 
where the  are analogues of the variables  for each of
the classically unbroken  groups, and they should therefore
obey
 _j=0 ^N_i-1  y^(i) _j = _i^3N_i 
for each . The superpotential in the form () only depends
on variables , not on the eigenvalues  of . In addition,
it depends on a choice of classical vacuum, whereas the superpotential
() with the  included describes all vacua.
Therefore, a description like () can only emerge after we
integrate out the . 

To illustrate how an expansion like () can emerge, we consider
the case , with superpotential 
, so that . 
As a first step, we integrate out the 
's in the quantum superpotential. This can be done explicitly,
the solutions for the  read
 
 
Notice that we chose the signs of the square roots in such a way that
in the classical limit  we indeed end up in a vacuum where
 is broken to . Therefore integrating out the
 also involves the selection of a classical vacuum configuration. 
If we insert the values for  in the superpotential, and expand
the result to second order in , we get
 
If we next integrate out , this becomes
W_eff  = -1 2a  (
y_0 y_1 + ^8 y_0y_1  - y_1 y_2 - ^8 y_1 y_2 
).
Interestingly, this depends on only two independent variables, namely
 and , and therefore it is already of the form ().
Indeed, if we define
y^(1) _0 = -y_0y_1 2a , y^(1) _1 = -^8 2ay_0y_1 , y^(2) _0 = y_1y_2 2a , y^(2) _1 = ^8 2ay_1y_2 
then () is of the form (), and 
, 
, completely in
agreement with () and ().

Of course, the above result is simply the semiclassical result at leading order.
It would be very interesting to go beyond the leading order, and to understand
in detail how the expansion is organized. We have not studied this in detail,
but expect the following. In general the value of the superpotential is
invariant under the flows () of the integrable system. Some
of the flows are stationary at the extremum, but some are not, and that is
why there is a  complex parameter family of minima (see also the discussion
in section 3.1.) If we could redefine our  variables in such a way that
 of them are independent of the  flows that do not degenerate,
then the superpotential should be a non-trivial function of these  variables
only. This is exactly the number of independent variables that appears in the
semiclassical expansion (). Hence we expect that the semiclassical
expansion appears naturally by integrating out the variables  and , and by
subsequently redefining the complex variables  in a suitable way, exactly
as in our example above. 

To conclude this section, we illustrate in the case of  with a cubic potential
 how the solutions found in section 4.6 can be expanded in
(possibly fractional) powers of .

For the maximally confining case, with , we have
_i & = & a - ^2 a  +

y_i & = & ^2 + 

L & = & 2 a ^2 + with  a fourth root of unity.

For  with  we find
_1=_3=-_2=-_4  & = & a - (+1  )
^2 2a 
+ 

y_0=y_2 & = & ^2+

y_1=y_3 & = & 1   ^2 +

L & = & 0 .
Here, and in the solutions below,  indicates the free
parameter that is related to the additional unbroken  that
one gets in the corresponding vacuum solution.

For  with  the expansion reads

 
& & 
  

L & = & ^4 a  + .
This result differs considerably from (),
illustrating the fact that these are two different solutions.

Finally, for  the result is an expansion in
^4 2a )^1/3 ,
which reads


 
& & 
  

L & = & 2 a ^2 +   .


















Integrable systems interpretation 

The Lax matrix of the periodic Toda chain played an essential role in the
construction of the effective superpotential in three dimensions. One of the 
motivations of this work was to try to find a direct relation between the 
periodic Toda chain and the Dijkgraaf-Vafa matrix model. We have not yet
succeeded in finding a direct relation, but nevertheless we have found that
the supersymmetric vacua in three dimensions have a very nice interpretation in
terms of the Toda integrable system. To explain this, we first need to define
the operator  that appears in (),which acts
on powers of the Lax matrix ; ,
given in (), depends on a spectral parameter . Therefore, 
any power of  can be written as a series in  as
M^k = _r z^r M^k_(r)  Next, we define  as the sum of the upper diagonal part of  plus
,  as the sum of the lower diagonal part of
 plus , and finally  as the diagonal
part of . Then
L (M^k) M^k_- + M^k_0 - M^k_+ .
One can interpret powers of  also as elements of the affine Lie algebra
, with  corresponding to the extra affine root of the
extended Dynkin diagram. Then () is nothing but the statement that 
all positive affine roots change sign. Alternatively, one can embed 
 in , by extending every matrix to a periodic infinite
matrix with period  (i.e. ), and by replacing  by the
shift matrix  with . Then () amounts
to just changing the sign of the upper triangular part of the corresponding infinite
matrix.

The equations of motion derived from () imply that the flow 
generated by  degenerates. This translates to the equations
[M,W'(M)_+ - W'(M)_-]=0, W'(M)_0=0.
A second observation, which follows from (), is
that 
 
[M,P_N(M)_+ - P_N(M)_-]=0.
The two equations (), () define a reduction of the integrable
Toda system. As we will show in, these equations imply the 
existence of polynomials  of degrees 
such that
(W'(M)_+ - W'(M)_-)^2 & = & W'(M)^2 + f_n-1 (M)   

W'(M)_+ - W'(M)_- & = & G_n-k (M) (U_k(M)_+ - U_k(M)_-)  

(P_N(M)_+ - P_N(M)_-)^2 & = & P_N(M)^2 - 4 ^2N   

P_N(M)_+ - P_N(M)_- & = & H_N-k (M) ((U_k(M)_+ - U_k(M)_-)  

(U_k(M)_+ - U_k(M)_-)^2 & = & T_2k (M). This system of equations demonstrates not only that the extrema of the superpotential
() are in exact one-to-one correspondence with the four-dimensional results,
it also shows that we can construct the four-dimensional equations ()
and () directly in terms of the Lax matrix. In particular, the matrix
model resolvent  satisfies the
very simple equation
 R(M) =W'(M)_-.
Actually, equation () is tantalizingly close to a similar equation that
can be derived for matrix integrals of the form 
 de^-W() .
If one defines a set of orthogonal polynomials with respect to the measure
, of the form , one can construct a semi-infinite
matrix  that acts on  as multiplication by . This semi-infinite 
matrix is tridiagonal (i.e.  for ), and obeys the "string
equation"
(see for example and references therein)
[Q,-1 2 (W'(Q)_+ - W'(Q)_-)]=1 .
The only difference between () and () is that one is replaced by 
zero. Equation () is also the equation that gives rise to the string equation
in the matrix model description of minimal models coupled to gravity. 
Though () and () are very similar, we have not found a direct
map between  and . Whereas  is relevant for the orthogonal polynomials
defined with respect to ,  seems to define orthogonal polynomials for 
a measure which coincides with the gauge theory resolvent instead. 
Various other relations between matrix integrals and the Toda lattice equations are
discussed in e.g..

The definition of the gauge theory resolvent (the generating functional of
) requires some discussion. For sufficiently large ,
we can no longer have the identity , because
the right hand side will start to depend non-trivially on the spectral parameter.
The resolution is to use the fact that given a Lax matrix  of size
, there is a corresponding Lax matrix  of size 
which is constructed using the replica procedure given in section 4.5. For
small , , but for larger values
of  the right hand side starts to depend on the spectral parameter, whereas
the left hand side does not. We therefore propose
^m = _t  1 t 
Tr (M_tN ^m) 
as the right definition for arbitrary . 
Note that the replica procedure yields 
 
With this expression for  and the identities for Chebyshev polynomials 
 
it is easy to see that this proposition yields a resolvent that agrees with the field theory result of, 
 
 Therefore,  for large
 provides a master field for . For the simple case of a quadratic
superpotential (see section 4.3)  takes a simple form, and  for
infinite  can be written in a simple way in terms of Cuntz variables. In this way it
also provides a master field for the Gaussian matrix model, as observed in 
, but this appears to be a coincidence that happens only for
quadratic superpotentials. Whether there is a direct way other than 
() to extract the matrix model resolvent remains to be seen.

A further discussion and a proof of relations ()-() will be
given in.


Interpretation of glueball fields 


Though we have seen that the matrix model resolvent has a direct interpretation
in terms of the Lax matrix, this does not yet explain how to relate it to the
four-dimensional superpotential (). One thing that is easy to
do is to figure out what the interpretation of the chiral superfield 
is. According to, the -dependence can be derived from the value
of the superpotential at the minimum by integrating it back in. The integrating
in procedure amounts to replacing  by
. The value  in the exponent comes from the coefficient of the -function in 3d. 
Integrating out  reproduces , and the -dependence
is found by integrating out . 

Now the only -dependence of the effective action is through the
Lagrange multiplier term (), and if we integrate out 
from
L ( ^2N  _i=0 ^N-1  y_i  ) +
S  ( ^2N  ^2N   )
we obtain
S   ( ^2N  _i=0 ^N-1  y_i  )

which is the same as the original Lagrange multiplier term (),
except that  has been replaced by . This shows that in general the Lagrange
multiplier  can  be identified with . 
To illustrate this fact, we will next demonstrate how to recover the semiclassical
expansion in four dimensions in terms of  from the three-dimensional superpotential
(). 
We will consider two cases:  in the maximally confining case and  breaking to . 
After that, we will return to the general case. 


 

For convenience we specialize to the superpotential
 
which has extrema at . Since we are going to study the maximally confining case there is only one chiral superfield , which therefore has to be equal to the Lagrange multiplier :
 
As explained above, the -dependence can be recovered from the superpotential
 
by integrating out the 's and the 's degrees of freedom. This means we have to solve for the extrema of the superpotential in terms of the 's and 's, so we can simply use the results of section 
(Since we do not want to integrate out  we have to be careful not to use the equation of motion for : . ) . The only thing we have to do is to choose the vacuum. In the classical limit  is , we pick . To integrate out the 's we pick the corresponding solution from section  (with )
 
Plugging this into the superpotential leaves us with
 
The next step is to integrate out the 's
 
To solve () we write
 
Then () can be written as
 
In principle there are three solutions for , however not all solutions have the right classical limit (). From the solution presented in section  we learn that in the classical limit we need to have , therefore:
 
The solution for  (with ) is (see for example)
 
yielding the following expression for 
 
Substituting this solution into the effective superpotential gives us, in principle, a closed expression valid to all orders in . However the form of this expression is not particularly illuminating and therefore we expand the superpotential in 
 
here  is the mass of the fluctuations of  around the classical extremum .

Let us compare this with the four dimensional answer, in that case we would write (for gauge group )
 
For a superpotential  (i.e. ) the function  is given by
 
So we see that equation ()
 is in good agreement with the four-dimensional answer.


 

In this section we consider the gauge group  and the superpotential as in equation (). We expand around the following vacuum
 
Classically this vacuum breaks the  to a  symmetry. So in this case there are two chiral superfields involved:  and . However, we can only integrate in the sum of these, since . To integrate in  we use the same approach as in the previous section, we integrate out the 's and 's.

The first steps are parallel to the calculation done in section 5.
We integrate out the 's first, allowing us to express the 's in terms of the 's
 
 
We plug this into the superpotential which is then expressed in terms of the 's only. In principle we can proceed to integrate out the 's, however the algebra involved is rather messy, therefore we choose to expand the superpotential as a power series in the 's. Up to second order the superpotential then reads
 
Integrating out the 's yields
 
and leads to the following effective superpotential
 
The scale , corresponding to the , can be related to the scales of the 's  (we will write )
 
So we finally have
 

In order to compare this with the four dimensional result 
we should express this effective superpotential in terms of , so we have to integrate out . Since we have expanded the action only to first order in the chiral superfields, the two chiral superfields don't mix and integrating out  is trivial. The result is that , substituting this in the superpotential gives us back equation ().

Going from  to  

Once we identify the Lagrange multiplier  with the glueball field ,
there is a concrete procedure to find the superpotential as a function of  from
(). One may wonder whether one can also go back and start with the
result on  and construct the superpotential on . We don't know
whether this can be done in general, but a step in this direction is to show
how one can obtain  () from (). The procedure is very similar
to the path integral derivation of 2d mirror symmetry given in.
Starting with the Veneziano-Yankielowicz superpotential 
W_VY (S) = S[ ( ^3N  S^N  ) + N ]
we first write it in a form as if it were built out of  pieces rather than ,
W_VY  _t=1 ^N S_t[ ( ^3  S_t  ) + 1 ] + _t=1 ^N-1  Z_t(S_t-S_t+1 ).
If we integrate out the variables , all  are identified, and we are back
at the form () of the superpotential. However, we proceed by integrating
out the  from () instead. This yields
W^3 (e^Z_1  + e^Z_2-Z_1  + + e^-Z_N-1  )
which is indeed precisely of the form (). It would be very interesting
to understand whether and how these transformations can be generalized, perhaps
in the spirit of 2d mirror symmetry, to more complicated situations. 

Interpretation of the individual  

A full reconstruction of the superpotential () from ()
requires us to not only find the right interpretation of , but
also of the individual . To do this the nature of the semiclassical expansion
discussed in section 5 is probably crucial. If we could write the superpotential
in the form () with constraints (), we could try to
impose the constraints () using various Lagrange multiplier fields
 similar as in (), and it would then be natural to identify
those with the . To lowest order, this would simply boil down to integrating
in the  in each individual gauge group and therefore correctly reproduce
the Veneziano-Yankielowicz superpotentials (). We leave a further study
of this to future work. 


Conclusions 

In this paper we have described the low-energy effective superpotential
for supersymmetric gauge theories on . We have shown
that it yields precisely the same vacuum structure as one obtains on ,
but the relation between the two is highly non-trivial. The results are
a first step towards a direct derivation of the integrable system that
underlies the Dijkgraaf-Vafa matrix model from field theory.

We believe that the formulation of the theory on  offers
some advantages over the formulation on . For instance, the generalization
of the periodic Toda chain to arbitrary gauge groups is known,
and therefore the present formalism should also be applicable to groups like
 and , for which the Dijkgraaf-Vafa matrix model has not yet been
worked out. We also know the relevant integrable system for various other
gauge theories,as summarized in,
such as  theories with matter,
 super Yang-Mills theory,
certain conformally invariant  theories with gauge groups of quiver type
, and even for some 5d theories.
Ultimately, we would like to understand in all these cases the nature of the
reduction of the integrable system in a supersymmetric vacuum, thereby generalizing 
the results in section 6. 

In string theory, there is no obvious way to describe 3d field
theory results using topological string theory, since this would require some
7d topological string theory. The integrable system can however in some cases
be extracted
from string theory using dualities and suitable brane configurations 
, and it is worthwhile to explore this connection further. 

The integrable system itself plays a crucial role in this discussion. There are
many physical properties that beg for a nice explanation in terms of the
integrable system, such as for example the loop equations and generalized
Konishi anomaly of. At the same time, there are many features of
the integrable system we have not yet used, such as the description of its
solutions in terms of algebraic-geometric data, and 
such as the existence of
additional flows associated to Whitham times (see e.g. and
references therein). The latter may
help in finding the correct interpretation of the gluino bilinear superfields 
.

We found it particularly elegant that lifting vacua from  to  had such
a nice interpretation in terms of a simple replica trick for the Lax matrix.
In this context it is amusing to observe that there is a close relation between
replica tricks, random matrix theory and the Toda lattice hierarchy 
, but whether that is of any relevance to the present discussion
remains to be seen.

A recurrence relation for  
In this appendix we derive a recurrence relation for characteristic polynomials of the following type
 
This determinant can be expressed in  terms of determinants of the following form
 
Expanding  along the bottom line and keeping only z-independent terms we get

The  and  are tri-diagonal and therefore satisfy the recurrence relations
 
 

As a special case, take all the y's and 's equal, then  and the recurrence relation for  is
 
in this case it is easy to show that the  satisfies the same recurrence relation as the
