The -deformed kink of the model is obtained via the
normalisable ground state eigenfunction of a fluctuation operator
associated with
the -deformed hyperbolic functions. The kink mass, the bosonic zero-mode
and the -deformed potential in 1+1 dimensions are found.

introduction 

The kink of a scalar potential in 1+1 dimensions is a static,
non-singular, classically stable  and a finite localized energy
solution of the equation of motion, which can be in topologically stable
sectors.
In a recent lecture,
an investigation on the topological defects starting with the simplest case
of domain walls was presented, and then considerations to more
elaborate and realistic models were put forward.

In the present letter, one works
with the algebraic technique of the SUSY QM  formulated by Witten
, which is associated with a second order
differential equation for the -deformed hyperbolic functions.
Recently, the -deformed hyperbolic function was used to construct a new
pseudo-Hermitian
 complex potential with PT symmetry. Other potentials
like Rosen-Morse well, Scarf, Eckart and the generalized Poschl-Teller
were constructed  via shape invariance.


The stability equation for topological and non-topological solitons has been
approached in the framework of supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY QM)
. The marginal stability and the
metamorphosis of Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) states
have been investigated, via SUSY QM, and  presented a detailed analysis for
a 2-dimensional Wess-Zumino model with two chiral superfields,
and composite dyons in -supersymmetric gauge theories.

In this letter, the interesting program of proposing a new potential model in
1+1 dimensions, whose essential point is associated with the translational
invariance of the -deformed kink solutions, is investigated.


Solitons in 1+1 dimensions 

Consider the Lagrangian density for a single scalar field,  in
(1+1)-dimensions, in natural system, given by

 
where   is any positive semi-definite function of , which
must have at least two zeroes for soliton solution to exist. It represents a
well-behaved potential energy. However, as it will be shown below, we have
found a new potential which is exactly solvable in the context of
the classical theory in (1+1)-dimensions.

The field equation for a static classical configuration, 
 becomes

 
with the following boundary conditions: 
 as 



Since the potential is positive, it can be written as

 
Thus, the total energy for the -kink becomes

 
In this case, the  Bogomol'nyi form of the energy, consisting of a
sum of squares and surface terms, becomes


 
under the well-known Bogomol'nyi condition for the kink solution,

 
where the solutions with the plus and minus signs represent two static
field configurations.


Stability Equation 

The classical stability of the soliton solution is investigated by
considering small perturbations around it,

 
where we expand the fluctuations in terms of the normal modes,
 
with the s chosen so that  is real. A localized
classical configuration is said to be dynamically stable if the fluctuation
does not destroy it. The equation of motion becomes a Schrodinger-like
equation, viz.,


 
where  is the fluctuation operator.
According to (), one  obtains the supersymmetric form
 
where the primes stand for a second derivative with respect to the
argument.

If the normal modes of () satisfy   the
stability of the Schrodinger-like equation is ensured. Now, we are able
to implement a method that provides a new potential from  the potential
term that appears in the fluctuation operator.

Next, we consider the following generalized potential as corresponding to
the potential part of the fluctuation operator:

 
where  and we are using the -deformed hyperbolic functions which were
introduce by Arai:


 
where R . Thus

 

The -deformed potential term provides a fluctuation operator, so that their
eigenvalues satisfy the condition 
 and the ground state associated to the zero mode ()
is given by

 
where  is the normalization constant. Thus, the stability of the
Schrodinger-like equation is ensured.

The potential model we are now going to study presents translational
invariance, then, the bosonic zero-mode eigenfunction of the stability
equation is related with the kink by

 
so that, a priori, we may find the static classical configuration by a
first integration. Therefore, the potential model


 
yields a class of -deformed scalar potentials, 
which have exact
solutions.

Expressing the position coordinate in terms of the kink, i.e.
 then, from () and () we obtain the -deformed
kink


 
The explicit form of the -kink for few values of  is
shown in Fig. 1.

From Eqs. () and (), we find a -deformed
potential model with spontaneously
broken symmetry in scalar field theory, viz.,

 
It represents a well-behaved potential energy. Note that the -deformed
 model has a discrete symmetry as  but it is
spontaneously broken for the vacuum state by the existence of two
degenerate vacua:

 


The fact that the energy is finite is ensured because the kink
by the behavior of the approaches
one of the vacuum solutions at  In the -deformed
 model there are four topological sectors, which are represented
by two
spaces  and  containing the -deformed vacuum
solutions 
and  and two spaces  and  containing the kink
and the anti-kink solutions.

The energy density of the -kink is given by


 


Therefore, the kink mass or the so-called classical mass of the
pseudoparticle is given by

 
which is dependent of  Note that when 
the undeformed case is re-obtained. In figure 2, we plot
the energy density given by
Eq.(),
for few values of .

The  conserved topological
current becomes:

 
where  is the antisymmetric tensor in two dimensions
 and is zero for the case
with repeated index.
The kink number or conserved topological charge is given by

 
which does not generate symmetries of the Lagrangian density and, therefore,
 is not a Noether charge. However, this charge is absolutely conserved,
 so that the kink represents stable particle-like states.
Thus, the -kink states can not decay by quantum tunneling into the
vacuum.

From the -deformed potential, one then obtains the supersymmetric form

 
where the prime mean a first derivative with respect to the argument,
and  is the -deformed superpotential
associated to the -kink solution.
Thus, the bosonic and fermionic sector fluctuation operator
are respectively given by
 
where 
These fluctuaction operators  are also called the supersymmetric partners,
which are isospectral up to the ground state.
The shape invariance condition of the pair of SUSY partner
potential will be investgated in a forthcoming paper.

Conclusion 

In conclusion, we can say that, starting from a potential 
in terms of the -deformed
hyperbolic functions in the stability equation,
we construct the -deformed topological kink associated
to the -deformed  potential model. We shown that the kink
mass  is dependent of 
We stress that a very rich spectrum of the states
(the kink and the quantum excitations about them), which was totally
unexpected in this model has emerged because of the existence of soliton
solutions.
Finally, it is important to pointed out that one can extend our approach to 3+1 dimensions.
Indeed, the present work opens a
new route for future investigations on
domain walls from deformation of potential model in terms
of coupled scalar fields. For instance, let us point out
that  our approach can be
applied from two and threecoupled scalar fields in higher dimensions, where in both cases the
soliton solutions only depend
on  but not on  and .
