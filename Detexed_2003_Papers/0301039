Boundary charges in gauge theories (like the ADM mass in general
relativity) can be understood as integrals of linear conserved n-2
forms of the free theory obtained by linearization around the
background. These forms are associated one-to-one to reducibility
parameters of this background (like the time-like Killing vector
of Minkowski space-time). For such n-2 forms, a non-linear
completion is constructed that is closed in the full interacting
theory and thus allows the use of Stokes theorem without bulk
contributions, provided a one parameter solution to the full
equations of motion with appropriate fall-off conditions is used
and the reducibility parameters of the background are
simultaneously reducibility parameters of this one parameter
solution.

Introduction 

Both Lagrangianand Hamiltonian approaches to conservation
laws in gauge theories involve in some way the idea that it is the
linearized theory around the background that really determines the
asymptotically conserved  forms used for the construction of
boundary charges in gauge theories. Recent results from
variational calculus (see
 for a review and also
) corroborate this point of
view:
 
when restricted to solutions of the equations of motion,
equivalence classes of closed, local,  forms up to exact,
local,  forms correspond one-to-one to non trivial
reducibility parameters, i.e., possibly field dependent gauge
parameters such that the associated gauge transformations vanish
on solutions of the equations of motion, where gauge parameters
that vanish themselves on solutions of the equations of motion are
considered to be trivial;
in standard interacting gauge theories like general
relativity or semi-simple Yang-Mills theories in space-time
dimensions strictly higher than 2, there are no such reducibility
parameters and thus no non trivial conserved  forms; in other
words, every local  form that is closed on solutions of the
equations of motion is given by the exterior derivative of a local
 form on solutions of the equations of motion;
in linear gauge theories however, reducibility parameters may
very well exist; for instance in general relativity linearized
around some background, particular reducibility parameters are
given by the Killing vectors of the background and furthermore,
for the flat background in space-time dimensions strictly higher
than 2, they can be shown to be the only non trivial ones
.

In, the one-to-one correspondence has been
extended to (suitable equivalence classes) of asymptotically
conserved  forms on the one hand and asymptotic reducibility
parameters on the other hand. Furthermore, for given reducibility
parameters, the asymptotically conserved  forms have been
explicitly constructed out of the linearized equations of motion
and of the gauge transformations evaluated at the background. That
the associated charges have all the standard properties like time
independence or independence of the form or position of the closed
 dimensional hypersurface used in their definition is a
direct consequence of on-shell closure and of Stokes theorem. By
construction however, the  forms are only closed near the
boundary, when evaluated for asymptotic solutions, i.e.,
deviations from the background that satisfy the boundary
conditions and the linearized field equations to leading order.
Hence, the application of Stokes theorem to relate the boundary
charges to integrals over surfaces deep in the bulk will in
general involve bulk contributions.

From the point of view of the full interacting theory, different
expressions for asymptotically conserved  forms are
considered as equivalent to the linear  forms constructed
above, if asymptotically near the boundary, only the parts linear
in the field deviations from the background are non vanishing and
if these parts belong to the same equivalence class and thus
define the same boundary charges than the  forms of the
linearized theory. This leaves of course a lot of freedom in the
definition of these forms, and allows to show for instance that
the expressions derived in
 for
energy-momentum and angular momentum in asymptotically flat
general relativity are all equivalent (see also
e.g.  for a recent discussion).

Motivated by the work of Wald and Iyer
 on the formulation of
the first law of black hole mechanics in terms of Noether charge,
we will construct in this work non-linear  forms of the full
interacting theory which asymptotically near the boundary reduce
to the  form constructed previously (and thus correctly
describe the boundary charges), but that are furthermore closed in
a region of the bulk, provided that
 

the  form is constructed using a one parameter
solution to the full equations of motion valid in the region of
the bulk where one wants to use Stokes theorem; furthermore, the
Taylor expansion in the parameter of this solution is required to
satisfy suitable fall-off conditions near the boundary;

the exact reducibility parameters of the background are
simultaneously exact reducibility parameters of the one parameter
solution to the full equations of motion.


As a result, for these one parameter solutions, the boundary
charges are related to the integrals of the non linear  forms
over surfaces deep in the bulk.

In the next section, we  briefly review, in the context of the
linearized theory that is supposed to describe the full theory
asymptotically near the boundary, the expression for the linear
conserved  forms associated to the reducibility parameters of
the background.

Construction of the linear conserved n-2 forms of the free theory 

Let  denote a generating set of gauge
transformations, with associated gauge
symmetries , where the
parameters  are local functions, i.e., they may depend
on , the fields  and a finite number of their
derivatives. For all  with  local functions, we
define the current  form

 through Q_iR^i_(f^)=f^R^+i _(Q_i)d^nx+d_H
S^i_(Q_i,f^). In this equation, 
denote the associated generating set of Noether operators, R^+i _(L ^i )=0,while
, with  the total derivative
with respect to , is the horizontal differential. When
 is replaced with the left hand side of the Euler-Lagrange
equations of motion, one gets L ^i R^i_(f^ )=d_H S_f , S_f S^i_(L ^i ,f^ ). If , where  is
a background solution to the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion,
 are the equations of
motion linearized around ,
 is a generating set of
gauge transformations of the linearized theory and 
are field independent gauge parameters, the linearization around
 of full  gives L^free 
 ^i R^0i _(f^0 )=d_H s_f , s_f = S^0i _(L^free   ^i ,f^0 ),
where .
When acting on forms of degree  strictly lower than  that
vanish when the  and their derivatives are set to zero,
the horizontal differential  admits an inverse
 in the case of trivial topology, d_H^p_H, +^p+1 _H, d_H=1. It follows from lin  that if field independent non
vanishing reducibility parameters  of the free
theory are used, R^0i _(f^)= 0,the
associated  form of the linearized theory given by k_f =^n-1 _H, s_f ,is closed when the linearized equations of
motion hold: d_H k_f =s_f ^free 0.The explicit expression for  is
k_f []=+1 +2 _() [^j
 ^j_()  s_f  dx^ ].This result has been
derived in to which we refer for further
details, in particular the definition of the higher order
Lie-Euler operators  is
given in appendix A. Note however that the definition of 
 used here differs by an overall minus sign
from that used in. For later use, we also
recall the definition

 with
.

In the next section, we construct an expression for an  form
in the full theory that, under suitable assumptions, is closed
and reduces asymptotically to the  form expllinex  of
the linearized theory.

Construction of the non-linear closed n-2 forms of the full theory 

Let ,  be a one parameter family of field
histories and . Following
, chapter 4, pages 119-122, we have S_f [_1(x)]-S_f [_0(x)]&=& _0^1 ds
d ds ( S_f [_s])=_0^1 ds
(_() ^i_s
[ ^i_()  S_f 
][_s])
&= &d_H _H^n-1  S_f 
+^n_H d_H S_f , where for a  form
, ^p_H ^p=_0^1 ds
I^p__s(x) (^p)[_s(x)],with I^p__s (^p)=+1 n-p++1 
_() [^i_s(x) ^i_()  
^p dx^ ]. If we define K_f =^n-1 _H S_f ,it follows using
full  that d_H K_f =-^n_H (L ^i R^i_(f^)d^nx)+S_f [_1(x)]- S_f 
[_0(x)],for an arbitrary history .

The first step consists now in making sure that asymptotically
near the boundary, the  form  coincides with
the linear  form  discussed in the
previous section. This will the case if the fall-off conditions
are such that, in an expansion according to , only the term
independent of  of 
contributes because all the other terms fall off too fast near the
boundary. Indeed, for 
, we have in this case K_f I_(x) [S_f ][(x)]
=
+1 +2 _() [
^j(x) ^j_()  S_f  dx^ 
][(x)]. Taking into account
that L^free =^2
L ^i_() ^j_()  _(x) 
_() ^i_() ^j,the expression explexfullas  agrees with expllinex 
evaluated at  because [^S ^j_()  (-)_() ^S
L ^i_()  ][(x)]=^S ^j_()  
(-)_() [ ^2
L ^i_() ^j_()  _(x) 
_() ^j].Furthermore, if  is a
one parameter solution to the full equations of motion, L ^i [_s(x)]=0, s[0,1], is a solution to the linear equations of
motion defined by . This can be verified by
differentiating solfull  with respect to  and putting
 to zero.

In a second step, we want to derive sufficient conditions that
guarantee that  is closed in the bulk. If
 and
 are solutions to the full equations
of motion, the last two terms on the right hand side vanish.
Taking into account the explicit expression for the higher order
Lie-Euler operators, the first term on the right hand is given by
to ^n_H (L ^i R^i_(f^)d^nx)&=&
=^1_0 ds
_() [&^i_s(x)&
( )(-_() )^S ^i_()()  
(L ^i ) R^i_(f^)
&+&L ^i 
^S ^i_(s)()  (R^i_(f^))][_s(x)](d^n-1 x)_.The terms in
the last line vanish if  is a one parameter family of
solutions to the full equations of motion, whereas the terms in
the second line vanish if the parameters  are
reducibility parameters of this one parameter family of solutions,
R^i_[_s(x)](f^)=0, s[0,1].
In other words, for a given solution  of the full
equations of motion, the  form  is closed, d_H K_f =0, provided a one parameter family of
solutions to the full equations of motion interpolating between
 and the background solution  is used
and the parameters  are reducibility parameters
for this interpolating solution.

Finally, the variation of  for a different one
parameter solution , with 
, is given by K_f &=&^1_0ds
+1 +2 _() (^i_s ^i_()  
S_f  dx^ [_s(x)]+
^i_s ^i_()   S_f  dx^ [_s(x)])
&&k_f [(x)].Standard applications 

Because ,
where  denotes a variation of the fields  and their
derivatives,  
is given by the right hand side of expllinex , where
 are replaced by
. The  forms of the linearized
theory given by expllinex  have been explicitly computed,
up to an overall sign difference, in section
6 for Yang-Mills theory and general relativity, so that we can
directly take over the corresponding results.

In the Yang-Mills case, one gets K_f &=&(d^n-2 x)_ ^1_0 ds Tr (f f^ _s ) 

&=&(d^n-2 x)_ Tr (f(F^ (x)-F^ (x))),where
.
Equivalently, K_f  &=& (d^n-2 x)_ ^1_0
ds (^Tr (f a^_s)-^Tr (f a^_s)) 
&=& 2(d^n-2 x)_ ^Tr (f (A^(x)-A^(x))) , where
D_[A_s(x)]f=0has been taken into account. In
this case, the result does not depend on the choice of the
solution  interpolating between  and
.

In the case of matter free gravity with Lagrangian

one gets K_f =1 16 (d^n-2 x)_ ^1_0 ds - g (
^D^h+^D_h^ +_D^h^ 
+hD^^+h^ D_^+h^  D^_-() )


=-1 16 (d^n-2 x)_ ^1_0 ds -
g (_D_H^  +12
H^  __),
 where  is the
following expression with the symmetries of the Riemann tensor:
H^ [h;g]&=& -h^ g^ 
-h^ g^  +h^ g^ 
+h^ g^ ,


h_ &=& h_ -1 2  g_  h, and it is understood that
 and that 
 is the metric used to define the covariant
derivative and, together with its inverse, to lower and raise the
indices. An equivalent expression is K_f =
1 16 (d^n-2 x)_ ^1_0 ds -g (
h^ D_ ^-_D^h^  -h D^^
+^(D_h^ -D^h)-()), where the Killing equation D__+D__has been used. Apart from the
 dependence and the integration over , this is the
expression derived in. As pointed out in
, this expression is in turn equal to 
, where  and  are defined in
(61) respectively (63) of. Explicitly, Q_ [g]=-1 16 (d^n-2 x)_ -g D^^is the Komar integral, while [g,h]=1 16 (d^n-1 x)_-g (D_h^ -D^h),and we can use this expression
here to partially integrate : K_f &=&^1_0ds ( d ds  Q_ [g_s(x)]-^d dx^ [g_s(x),h_s(x)])

&=&Q_ [g(x)]-Q_ [g(x)]-^1_0ds
^d dx^ [g_s(x),h_s(x)].As in
, this last expression and the
corresponding variation can then be used for instance to discuss
the first law of black hole mechanics.
Conclusion 

In standard interacting gauge theories like semi-simple Yang-Mills
theory or general relativity in space-time dimensions strictly
higher than 2, all local  forms that are closed on-shell are
trivial in the sense that they are given, on-shell, by the
exterior derivative of local  forms. In the linearized theory
around the background, however, non trivial on-shell closed 
forms do exist and they are in one-to-one correspondence with non
trivial reducibility parameters of the background. In this paper,
we have constructed  forms of the full interacting theory,
that under suitable assumptions, are on-shell closed and reduce
asymptotically to the  forms used in the definition of the
boundary charges. As a consequence, Stokes theorem can be used to
relate the boundary charges to the integral of these  forms
on surfaces deep in the bulk.
