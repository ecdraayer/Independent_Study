I consider gravity induced 
over a smooth (finite thickness) soliton. Graviton kinetic term is coupled to
bulk scalar that develops solitonic vacuum expectation value. 
Couplings of Kaluza-Klein modes to soliton-localized matter are suppressed, giving rise to 
crossover distance  between 4D and
5D behavior. This system can be viewed as a finite  thickness brane 
regularization  of the model of Dvali, Gabadadze and Porrati.







Introduction 

Brane worlds theories with large or infinite extra dimensions recently
provided insight to a number of problems of high energy physics and 
possible relations between them. Those models can emerge as a part of
the fundamental higher dimensional theory described in terms of strings.
Even if extra dimensions are not realized in nature, they are valuable 
testing ground for new ideas in particle physics and gravity.

For some time, it was believed that the extra dimensions can exist only if
they are compact or have a finite volume. The problem with the infinite volume extra
dimensions was how to obtain a four dimensional force of gravity between objects
located at the brane. In work, it was shown that the four dimensional
Newton's force arises on the brane due to an induced kinetic term. 
The model of Dvali, Gabadadze and Porrati is described by the action 

DGP 
S=M_* ^3d^4 xdyG R _5 +M_P ^2d^4 x dy(y)g R_4 .
Here  is the coordinate of an extra dimension,  is 5D curvature,  5D metric,
 is 4D curvature constructed from metric induced on the brane 
,  is the fundamental scale of gravity
and  scale that characterizes brane rigidity. In order to obtain the correct
value for Newton's constant on the brane,  has to be taken GeV.
The brane is represented with the delta function i.e. thickness of the brane is taken to be zero. 
A related model with one infinite extra dimensions was presented and studied in.
Phenomenology of the action () was studied in. There it was shown that the
scale of the bulk gravity can be as low as eV. Further properties of the model, 
cosmological evolution, new manifestations at astronomical
scales and string theory realizations were examined in. 

In these notes, I study a similar system of induced (enhanced) gravity over a smooth soliton
SYS 
S=M_* ^3 d^4 xdyG R _5 (1+M_P ^3 M_* ^3  ^2 (M_P y)).
Here  is a localized function representing a smooth tension-less soliton. I 
find that at the linearized level, features of () and () are the
same. In short, four dimensional gravity at distance  is mediated by
a metastable massless resonance. Width of the resonance is . At distances ,
gravity becomes five dimensional. Therefore I conclude that () is a finite thickness
brane regularization of ().

Through the paper I will work with the simpler 'scalar gravity' model that captures
main features of gravity.
A Variation of the strength of the kinetic term can be a consequence of dilaton-like coupling to 
bulk scalara () that exhibits solitonic vev. I neglect the gravitational effect of the soliton,
which is equivalent to fine-tunning its tension to zero.
In the next section I study properties of the spectrum of Lagrangian in which the
strength of kinetic term is a function of the extra coordinate. Results are applicable for
scalar and gauge bulk field as well as for linearized gravity. In section 3, I investigate the 
spectrum of Kaluza Klein modes in system () and their coupling to soliton-localized matter.
I find the crossover distance , both from 
the suppression of couplings of KK modes 
to matter localized on soliton and from an equivalent problem of tunneling through 
the potential barrier. I find no new scale   (where
 is the brane thickness), contrary to results of  
, where the different regularization scheme was considered. 
I conclude that the system () can be viewed as a finite thickness brane regularization of
action (). In the appendix I outline the procedure for finding the spectrum
of fermionic modes when the kinetic term of a bulk fermion field is varying through
the extra dimension.




Localization in model with non-homogeneous kinetic term  

In this section I investigate general properties of a model in which 
the strength of a kinetic term for a bulk field is not homogeneous through
the infinite extra dimension. 
Let us take that the bulk field  
is coupled through the kinetic term to a field 

solmod 
L =f()_A ^A +_A ^A -V().
Function  characterizes the coupling of two fields.
Field  has potential  and can obtain an expectation
value in the form of a soliton . Then, the Lagrangian
for the field  has the following form

firstl 
L =f(y)_A ^A .
Field  can represent  bulk scalar, gauge field or graviton in linearized approximation. 

To find the four dimensional spectrum of () we decompose field 
into Kaluza Klein modes , where
. The differential equation for wave functions  is

ekv 
f(y)_y ^2_m +_y f(y)_y _m +f(y)m^2_m =0.
Taking equations () for two different eigenvalues , cross-multiplying them with
eigenfunctions, subtracting and integrating over the length of extra dimension 
we get the orthogonality relation

orth 
f(y)_n _m dy=_m _m,n ,
where  is the normalization constant. Combining () and () we get 

nogo 
f(y)_y _n _y _m dy f(y)_n _m dy =m^2.
For non-negative , both the denominator and numerator of this expression are positive, which
means that there are no ghosts, tachions or ghost tachions in effective four dimensional
action obtained from ().  We can introduce additional coupling of field  to a 
'charge' density   localized at the soliton (centered at ). 
In 4D effective theory the coefficient of a coupling is determined by the convolution
of the matter profile  and the wave function 
(an average of wave function over the soliton-localized matter) 

convo 
 _m (0)(y)_m (y)dy.
Effective action for  modes  then reads

efac 
L =1 2 _m ( _ _m ^ _m -m^2_m ^2 
)+_m  _m (0) M_* ^3 _m   _m (x),
where  is the fundamental scale. Zero mode 
will be normalizable for choices of  whose integral is finite, while it will be a single
mode in continuum for functions  that are nonzero at .
This feature distinguishes between the cases of localization and quasi-localization.
In order to find the spectrum and determine localization properties of KK modes, one has to
specify the function . To better understand the connection between the shape of  and 
localization properties, it is useful to transform () to related Schroedinger problem

schro 
_m _m f  ,-_y ^2_m +V(y)_m =m^2_m ,
where the localizing potential  has the form

locpo 
V(y)=( 1 2 f"(y) f(y) -1 4 (f'(y) f(y) )^2).
Whether this potential will behave as an attractive well or a repulsive barrier depends on the
balance between the magnitude of the second and first derivative of the profile .



 

Now we consider two choices of function  that lead to the localization
of part or all of the spectrum of KK excitations. 
First example is a Gaussian profile .
Here,  is the scale that determines the brane width.
This profile will give rise to a localized tower of KK modes with masses
, where  is the integer. This 
was used as a model of localization of gauge fields in. Here we repeat it because
we will use it as a starting point for the investigation of soliton induced 
gravity in the next section.

Potential () that results from this profile is the potential of a simple
harmonic oscillator shifted by a constant so that the zero point energy vanishes

sho 
V(y)=a^2(a^2y^2-1).
Normalized wave functions () are 

wfho 
_n (y)=1 2^n n!^1/2   e^-(ya)^2/2 H_n (ya),
where the spectrum of masses goes like

spho 
m_n =a2n ,n=0,1,2,...
The interaction of those modes with some charge located at the brane is determined
by the value of the wave function at the position of the charge. For example, coupling of a charge
at   is

coupho 
L _I =_n (-)^n/2 an!  2^n/2 M_* ^3 (n/2)! _n ,
for  even, while it vanishes for odd . The vanishing of coupling for odd values
of  is also true for a smooth brane that localize charge . The reason is
that wave functions of modes with odd  are odd, while the matter localization profile 
 is even and coupling () vanishes.


 

Other example is the exponentially decaying profile . This is presented
as an example of a  localized profile  with a finite integral, that
doesn't localize all of the KK modes (as one could naively expect).
The Schroedinger potential for this profile is

pot2 
V(y)=1 4 a^2-a(y).
Spectrum of modes consist of a single localized zero mode

lzm 
_0 =a/2 e^-ay/2 ,
and a continuum of scattering states starting at  . The potential between two charges
 and  located at  due to exchange of field  would change from a four dimensional
law to a five dimensional law at distance .



Smooth brane regularization of DGP model 

In this section I establish the relation between the model of Dvali, Gabadadze and Porrati and
action () at linearized level.
Let us consider the five dimensional model with two scales. Fundamental scale  determines
the action of the bulk filed . The potential for the other bulk field 
is governed by the much higher brane scale . Therefore, scale  
determines the width of the brane, which is soliton of field . Field 
 is coupled quadratically to a kinetic term of , and the coupling is
suppressed in powers of fundamental scale 

pc 
L =(1+^2 M_* ^3 )_A ^A +
_A ^A Let us take that the field  gets expectation 
value  so that the profile function () is

dgpr 
f(y)=1+(a M_*  )^3e^-(ya)^2 1+Ae^-(ya)^2 .
Since we take that the soliton scale  is much bigger than the bulk scale ,
coefficient  is a huge number. The Schroedinger potential () for this 
profile is 

potq 
V(y)=-Aa^2A(1-(ya)^2)+e^(ya)^2 (1-2(ya)^2) (A+e^(ya)^2 )^2 .
Potential () is shown in Fig. 1 together with the potential of harmonic oscillator
().


file=FIG1.eps,width=10cm  
Figure 1:  Potential () (solid line)
together with the harmonic oscillator potential
() (dashed line).  is in units of inverse , the potential is in units of ,
while . 


For small values of , the potential coincides with the potential of a harmonic oscillator. After
certain a distance , the square well is 'cut' and the 
potential rapidly drops to zero. From this
behavior we can qualitatively predict the spectrum of states. Lowest bound states of the harmonic
oscillator will obtain width and will tunnel through the barrier. Since we are interested
in the case of gravity we want to find the decay width of a zero mode that will mediate
the four dimensional Newton's force on the brane. 
Higher modes have mass  and are irrelevant for low
energy physics. Decay width in the WKB approximation for the zero mode is

decw 
_0 a( -2_y_1 ^y_2 V dy),
where  are classical turning points and  is the width of the well. 
For large values of  condition for WKB validity  is well satisfied
everywhere (except at classical turning points). The integral in
() can be evaluated numerically for the 
large range of values . The integral is independent
of  and behaves as  (power has negligible numerical error). Therefore,
in the WKB approximation zero mode has a decay width

zmdw 
_0 a A^0.976  .
Wave functions of the continuous Kaluza-Klein spectrum can be found by solving the
Schroedinger equation. We find that the couplings of modes () to matter
localized on the soliton are suppressed. 

Here, we can explore the question of the universality of the coupling of filed  (scalar gravity)
to brane matter.
If different types of matter localized on the soliton have different profiles , coupling
() of gravity would be non-universal. This is sometimes argued to be a problem
(non-universality of coupling can in fact be a desirable property of models with infinite
extra dimensions. It opens the possibility for solving the cosmological constant problem without
spoiling general covariance of the resulting four dimensional theory. This was pointed out to me
by Gia Dvali.)  for
theories with gravity induced over a smooth brane. We adopt the following framework
in which the violation of universality is suppressed by soliton thickness scale .
The potential for a scalar field that forms solitonic brane
is governed by high mass scale . Here we take that . Mass of Standard Model 
fields is much lower than the cutoff . We take that SM particles come from the 
zero mode of another bulk field, while the mass splitting is due to some higher order effect. 
Zero modes have profiles roughly of a soliton itself . Potential well
that localizes zero mode can have bound states whose masses would be . Indeed 
wave functions of those states  are different and lead to the different 
coupling (). 
However, because of their large mass they are decoupled from low energy physics. 
Now let us return to the spectrum of potential ().
The Schroedinger equation for () can be solved numerically.
For simplicity, we take that the matter profile is  and evaluate coupling
() for the continuum of KK modes. The qualitative behavior of wave functions is
as follows. Outside the well, wave functions are plane waves of frequency . Inside the
well, wave functions are roughly Gaussians with mass-dependent height and constant width
(). Approximately, one can take for the coupling 
. 
Actual coupling was evaluated for each mode numerically.
Dependence of coupling () on the mass of KK mode is shown in Fig.2




file=FIG2.eps,width=12cm  
Figure 2:  Suppression of KK coupling for . 
For  coupling has value 1 (outside the graph range). Peaks are at positions of resonant 
states of harmonic oscillator  . Log-log plot
of the same graph (multiplied with ) is shown in the inset. 
The solid line has coefficient -1 to show
the suppression of coupling  . 


There is a peak located at the mass zero. This is the zero mass graviton resonance that is responsible
for the 4D force at short distances. This resonance starts at coupling 1 and decays
as  (see the log-log plot).
Dependence of the half-width of the peak at  on the magnitude of  can be evaluated by 
numerical analysis. By sampling data for the large range of values 
() we find

wi 
m a A^0.9970.005  .
Besides the metastable 'massless' graviton there is no other
resonances until we get to higher states of the harmonic oscillator that have mass .
In particular, nothing unusual
is happening at scale   contrary to the results of 
where a different regularization was used (there advocated mass scale
 would be on position -4.605 on the log-log graph in Fig.2).



Newtonian potential due to an exchange of field  between two masses
at short distances is given by

newt 
V(r)_0 ^  _m (0)^2  
M_* ^3 e^-mr  r dma M_* ^3 A 
1 r , r< A/a.
Here the integral is supported over the resonance of width  and height 1. At large distances
 only the lightest modes () contribute to the exchange. 
Their coupling is unsuppressed  and one
can approximate

newtl 
V(r)_0 ^  _m (0)^2  
M_* ^3 e^-mr  r dm1 M_* ^3  
1 r^2 , rA/a.
This is the same behavior of Newtonian potential  as in the model of Dvali, Gabadadze and Porrati.
A weak four dimensional force is mimicked by the exchange of a continuum of massive KK gravitons
at distances smaller than the crossover distance  . At larger distances, 
the force becomes 
five dimensional. Crossover distance in () coincides with the 
crossover distance in. In order to
reproduce the correct Newton's constant one has to take the scale  to be of the order of 
Planck scale 

rc 
r_c=A a =a^2 M_* ^3 =M_P ^2 M_* ^3 .
At the linearized level, an exchange of massive spin
two states gives 'wrong' tensor structure of the propagator
. It was shown  that non-linear effects cure this problem in model. 
I conjecture that a similar mechanism occurs in the model at hand. Investigation
of that effect as well as the spectrum of induced gravity in codimensions two and three is
currently in progress.

Method for fermions 


Here we outline the procedure for finding the KK spectrum for bulk
fermion field with kinetic term that is not homogeneous in extra dimension.
The action we consider is

fer 
S=d^5 Xf(y) i_A ^A .
Dirac algebra in 5D 
can be satisfied with a choice of 4D gamma matrices  and 
.

The equation of motion is independent of  and is solved with the ansatz

azap 
(p,y)=_m ( g_m(y)_L ^m +h_m(y)_R ^m )

_ p^ _L ^m =m_R ^m ,
_ p^ _R ^m =m_L ^m ,
where spinors  and  together form a 
4D Dirac spinor , i.e. 
. Wave functions are

soltocop 
g_m(y)=A_m(my)+B_m(my)
h_m(y)=A_m(my)-B_m(my).
Although wave functions are the same as in the case , four dimensional effective
action will be different, since one integrates over the profile . Plugging ()
into () and integrating over  we obtain the following 4D action

fdaf 
S=_m,n ( _m f_mn i/_n +
1 2  _m (m+n)f_mn _n  ),
where  is an infinite dimensional matrix given by a Fourier transform of the
profile

ft 
f_mn =dyf(y)(m-n)y.
Clearly, finding the spectrum of KK fermions (as well as their couplings) is now reduced to
a problem of diagonalization of infinite hermitian matrices  and 
. Diagonalization can be done in steps, and we can write schematically

diagon 
^ i/K+^ M^ _i _i i/_i +^ UMU^ 

^ i/+_i,j  ^ _i 
VUMU^  _i _j   V^ _j _m ( _m i/_m +m _m _m ),
where we rotated fermion sequentially as 

. Orthogonal matrices  are chosen to diagonalize the kinetic and
mass term. The simplest example is  in which case  and we
recover ordinary KK tower of massive fermions. Another simple example is  in
that case  has 1 at every entry. All eigenvalues of that matrix are zero except one that
is , where  is (infinite) number of positive modes in  (modes go from  to ).
Thus, only one mode will have nonzero kinetic term. Matrix  that diagonalizes  in
this case has entries 1 on the diagonal that goes from the lower left to upper right corner,
entries -1 in first column and entries 1 in last row, while all other entries are zero.
Matrix  has zeroes on diagonal. Thus, a single propagating mode has the mass zero.
It would be interesting to find the spectrum of induced 4D fermions 
by diagonalization of the infinite matrix  and
compare it to the results obtained by inducing 4D kinetic term on the brane.
