Abstract 


We argue that the AdS dual of the three dimensional critical 
vector model can be evaluated using the Legendre transform that relates 
the generating 
functionals of the free UV and the interacting IR fixed points of the
boundary theory. As an example, we use our proposal to evaluate
the minimal bulk action of
the scalar field that it dual to the spin-zero "current" of the
 vector model. We  find that
the cubic bulk self interaction  
coupling vanishes. We briefly discuss the implications of our results
for higher 
spin theories and comment on the bulk-boundary duality
for subleading .    
 
Introduction 

The relation between gauge fields and strings has been significantly
enlightened by the AdS/CFT correspondence
. The general picture emerging is that
the large tension 
limit of string theory corresponds, holographically, to strongly coupled gauge
theories. Nevertheless, one would
ideally like to go further and understand the stringy picture
of weakly coupled 
gauge theories. The small tension limit of
string theory is an obvious candidate for this picture and a semiclassical
description of it would be desirable. Higher spin gauge
theories might provide such a semiclassical 
description. Moreover, the formulation of higher spin
theories in AdS spaces opens the possibility for an holographic
interpretation of weakly coupled gauge theories. Recent work on higher
spin theories includes.

Recently, it was suggested that an interesting laboratory for studying
the relation between weakly coupled quantum field theories and higher spin
theories is provided by the well-known three dimensional critical
 vector model. The explicit proposal put forward in is
that both the free UV and the interacting IR fixed point of the
 vector model are holographically described by the same AdS
higher spin 
theory. A manifestation of such a  degeneracy in the holographic
description is the fact that the UV and IR generating
functionals of the critical  model are related by a Legendre
transform for large . This is one step further from the standard
cases of AdS/CFT
correspondence where the relation between the weakly and strongly
coupled boundary CFTs, even for large ,  is in general unknown. The apparent 
puzzle of having to describe both a free CFT (which does not have  anomalous
dimensions), as well as an interacting one, (which here has anomalous
dimension of ),  by
the  same AdS theory was recently argued to be resolved by a Higgs
mechanism for gauge fields with spin 2 in 
AdS. This mechanism is at work only when the bulk scalar is
quantized with boundary conditions 
such that is corresponds to an operator of dimension 2+ in the
boundary. On the other hand, it is knownthat for subleading  the massless degrees of freedom coupled at the
UV and IR fixed points of the critical  vector model are
different, hence the relation between the 
corresponding UV and IR generating functionals is less clear.

The Lagrangian for
the AdS higher spin theory is implicitly known through
complicated field equations. This may be reminiscent
of the standard 
situation with the IIB SUGRA that is dual to  SYM, however
there is an important difference: in the case at hand one knows
explicitly both the weakly as well as the strongly coupled regimes of
the boundary field theory. Therefore, one can work from bottom-to-top and evaluate the
bulk theory using the knowledge of the boundary CFT.
In this work we propose that the  evaluation of the bulk
AdS theory dual to the critical  vector model can be done by
a self-consistency procedure based on the Legendre transform that
relates the generating functionals of the free UV and the interacting
IR fixed points of the  vector model. To illustrate our idea, we
consider here the minimal ansatz for the AdS Lagrangian and work
out the tree level bulk couplings up to the quartic one. 
This is done by successively matching  the correlation
functions produced by the bulk AdS Lagrangian to the corresponding
ones of the boundary CFT which can be explicitly calculated. Although
we do not consider the coupling of the bulk scalar to higher spin
fields in AdS, our result for the bulk cubic self interaction coupling can be carried
over to the higher spin Lagrangian. Our calculation of the bulk quartic
self interaction coupling may be useful both as its stands
i.e. for a possible pure gravity dual of the  vector model or as
an intermediate result in
future calculations of the higher spin dual of the model.

In Section 2 we review the degeneracy in
the holographic correspondence for scalar fields in AdS with mass  in
the range , and its manifestation in terms of the
Legendre transform that relates the UV and the IR generating
functionals of the boundary theory. In Section 3 we apply our proposal
to evaluate the bulk action up to the the quartic scalar self interaction
term. In Section 4 we briefly discuss the implications of our results for higher
spin theories and comment on the nature of the bulk-boundary relation
for subleading . The Appendix is reserved for
a compact presentation of the many technical details.


 




The degeneracy in the holographic description and the
Legendre transform  

It was noticed already in  the early days of AdS/CFT that there is a
potential ambiguity in the holographic description of a boundary
theory. Let
 be a bulk scalar(We use
throughout the Euclidean version of the Poincare patch of AdS
with  where  and
we set the AdS 
radius to 1 such that the cosmological constant 
.)  with mass . Its asymptotic 
behavior near the 
boundary of AdS is
(r,x)_r0  r^_- _0(x )
+r^_+ A(x), _  = D 2  , 1 2 D^2 +4m^2 0.
The functions
 and  are the two necessary boundary data to
determine the solution of the second-order bulk equation of
motion for . Quantizing then  with boundary
condition  () would give the generating functional
of the boundary operator  with dimension 
( with dimension ). The above ambiguity
does not show up in most of the studied cases of AdS/CFT where the operator
 has dimension below the unitarity bound
i.e. .  

Nevertheless, there exist important cases where both  are
above the unitarity bound. Then, the quantization ambiguity
is present even when the 
asymptotic behavior () of  is determined by
one arbitrary boundary data as when one 
requires that the bulk solution vanishes in the far interior
() of AdS. In such a case the two functions
appearing in () are related by
A(x) = C__+ ^D
y1 (x-y)^2_+  _0(y), C__+  = 
(_+) ^D 2  () .
Then, the application of AdS/CFT correspondence yields either  a functional  of  or  a functional
 of . The first generates correlation functions of 
 and the second of . However, due to
() the two functionals are not independent but one is the
Legendre transform of the other asW[_0] +2^D x_0(x)A(x) = J[A], W[_0]  _0(x)  = -2A(x).
An interesting observation regarding the relation between 
and  was made in (see also
). The interchange between the boundary conditions
 and  is induced by a "double-trace"
deformation(This fact was also implicit in the OPE analysis
of multi-trace deformations in.) . One way to see
this is to first choose the boundary 
condition , which would yield the theory for the operator
 with dimension , and then perturb this
theory by 
. Noting then that 
, this perturbation is relevant and for 
 it leads to a
possible IR fixed point of the  theory, and at
the same time to the boundary condition . Therefore, 
may be viewed as the generating functional of the UV fixed point CFT
while  as the one for the IR fixed point CFT, the two being
connected by an RG flow. 

An application of the above phenomenon can be found in
the recently discussed case of the AdS dual of the critical
three-dimensional  vector model. It has been suggested in
 that this  well-known three-dimensional CFT has a dual in
AdS which might be a higher spin theory. For example, one would expect
that there exists an action for a massive scalar on AdS that
yields the generating functional for the spin-zero
"current"(This name is used for the operator proportional
  to  where 
,  are the elementary fields.)  of the free UV 
 CFT. On the other hand, the generating functional of
the interacting IR fixed point of the model gives the correlation
functions for 
a composite operator of dimension 2+. Then, by the arguments
above, these two
generating functional should be related by a Legendre transform as in
(). However, the IR generating functional
is the one directly obtained from the bulk AdS Lagrangian by the
standard AdS/CFT correspondence and involves the parameters of the
bulk Lagrangian. Moreover, the knowledge of higher-pt
correlation functions in the IR CFT gives information about anomalous
dimensions of various fields in the theory which can be directly translated
to information about corrections to masses of the bulk fields. In the next
section we describe explicitly the use of the Legendre transform as a
self-consistency condition to evaluate the parameters of the AdS
Lagrangian dual to the spin zero "current" of the critical 
model up to quartic order.

Evaluation of the AdS dual of the critical  vector
model 

The cubic bulk coupling 

The proposal of for the AdS dual of the spin zero
"current" of the critical 
vector model is to consider a conformally coupled scalar on
AdS. In this Subsection  we perform the calculations for general 
and keep in 
mind that at the end we want to set . The minimal 
gravity action
that could reproduce the correlation functions of the spin-zero
"current" of the critical  vector model is 
S_D+1  = 1 2^2_D+1  ^D+1  xg [ -R+ 2+
1 2 g^ __
-D^2-1 8 ^2 +g_3 3! ^3 +g_4 4! ^4+...].
The overall normalization of the action can be fixed by requiring that
the coefficient  of the energy momentum 2-pt function following
from () coincides with the one of the  vector
model. The latter is completely determined 
by the overall normalization of the  vector model action and
does not depend on the  normalization of the scalar
fields. Following the general treatment of the  vector model in 
 we have
C_T^O(N)  = ND (d-1)S^2_D ,
S_D =2^D 2   (D 2 ) . 
Then, from () and using the general result of for  we obtain to leading 
order in  
1 2^2_D+1   = N^D (D+1)(D) 1 S_D ^3 ,
1 2^2_4  = N 2^9 .
Next we concentrate on correlation function of the operators dual to
. We first use the "regular" boundary data
, we set  and perform for simplicity
the rescaling 
 to obtain the correlation
functions of normalized (Operators whose 2-pt function is of
order .)  operators
W[_0] = _n=2 ^ 1 n! ^D x_1...^D
x_n_0(x_1)..._0(x_n) _n(x_1,...,x_n). 
Up to 4-pt functions, the correlation functions that appear in
() are given 
explicitly in ()-() of Appendix A. 
The Legendre transform () of () may be
written as
J[A] = _n=0 ^ 1 n! ^D x_1...^D
x_n A(x_1)...A(x_n) P_n(x_1,...,x_n). 
Up to 4-pt functions, the -functions in () are related to
the -functions in 
() as shown in ()-() of Appendix
A. 

Now the requirement that the -correlation functions in
() are correlation functions of the free UV  vector
model comes into play. This provides the necessary dynamical principle
for the evaluation of the -correlation functions. At this point we need
to make an assumption for the normalization of the 2-pt functions of
the elementary -component scalars of the model. We can choose to
represent them as unit normalized 2-pt functions of free massless
scalars in  dimensions, i.e. 
^a(x_1)^b(x_2)=
^ab  (x_12 ^2)^d 2 -1  ,
a=1,2,..,N.
Notice that if , whose
correlation functions are given in (), is required to be
proportional to 
, the two parameters  and  are related as
D-3 = 2(d-3).
We are going to set  at the end, but one may view
() as the relation between two different 
regularization methods based on the analytic continuation in the
number of spacetime dimensions around 3.
Using () and (), the relation between
 and  can be found to be
O  (x) k N  ^a(x)^a(x), k^2 =
(D-1 2 ) 4^D+1 2   .
Next, using
() and () we obtain 
P_3(x_1,x_3,x_4) 8k^3 N  
1 (x_12 ^2x_13 ^2 
x_23 ^2)^D-1 4   .
Finally, from the relation
_3(x_1,x_2,x_3) = [P_3(x_1,x_2,x_3)]^amp. ,
and using the D'EPP formula () to amputate by  the
free 3pt function () we obtain
after some algebra
g_3^2
=1 N 1 2_D+1 ^2 2^4(D-3)^2^D+3 2  
  [(
    D-1 2 )]^3 [(D-1 4 )]^6 
 [( D+3 4 ) ]^2 
The result () is consistent with the results of
 where is was found that the 3-pt function of the
scalar field with 
dimension  vanishes at the interacting fixed point of the
three dimensional  vector model. Moreover, () shows that
for  the cubic coupling in the
AdS action () vanishes. This result is independent of
whether or not the bulk Lagrangian () contains 
higher spins, hence we conclude that the
cubic self interaction scalar coupling of the higher spin AdS theory vanishes.



The quartic bulk coupling 

To evaluate the quartic bulk coupling using the Legendre
transform it is simpler to set . 
From () and () we obtain
P_4(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4) 16k^4 N [
1 (x_12 ^2 x_24 ^2 x_43 ^2 
x_31 ^2)^D-1 2    +crossed  ].
Then, the calculation we need to perform is
_4(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4) &=& [P_4(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)]^amp.  

 &&+ ^3 x^3 y
[P_3(x_1,x_3,x)]^amp. _2(x,y)[
  P_3(y,x_3,x_4)]^amp.  +crossed , 
where the amputation is done with . 
Evaluating the integrals on the rhs of () and matching the
results with the explicit expression for  given in (),
would give the value of the quartic coupling . 

Let us start from the rhs of (). The integrals have been
calculated in, for general dimension , in terms of the
invariant ratios 
u=x_12 ^2x_34 ^2 x_13 ^2x_24 ^2  ,
v=x_12 ^2x_34 ^2 x_14 ^2x_23 ^2 ,
(see Appendix C of), although the form of the results does not appear to be
easily manageable. Nonetheless, our purpose here is to find  and
for that we only need the leading term in the short distance expansion of
the rhs of () as . In practice, we can
simplify things further by considering the expansion of the
integrals in terms of the variables  and  and consider the
leading term in  for .(This is inspired from OPE studies of
conformal 4-pt functions where the leading term in  with 
corresponds to the leading contribution of conformal scalars
.) 

From the results in Appendix C of one can see that the
rhs of () has an expansion of the form
[RHS of ()  ] 1 (x_12 ^2x_34 ^2)^2 ( v^2[-Av+B]+...),
where the dots stand for subleading terms. Now, the important point is
that the coefficient  of the  term exactly vanishes. Therefore,
we should not find a leading logarithmic term also in the lhs of
(). This condition determines .

Before turning to the evaluation of the AdS integrals in , we
comment on the vanishing of its leading logarithmic term. In order to
obtain the full 4-pt function of the operator  one should
add to  the disconnected part. Once this is done, the OPE
analysis of the 4-pt function can be performed. Notice now that the
vanishing of the 3-pt function  implies that the field 
 itself does not appear in the 4-pt function 
. The next scalar that contributes to
the OPE of this 4-pt function is a scalar field with dimension
 where . Then, the
4-pt function is expected to have the form 
O (x_1)O (x_2)O (x_3)O (x_4)
1 (x_12 ^2x_34 ^2)^  [1+v^  2  
+... ].
The vanishing of  term in () implies the
following relation between the anomalous dimension  of 
and 
1 2   -=0.
Given the known values  and
 we see that () is satisfied.

Now turn to the calculation of the leading logarithm in the lhs of
(). The contribution to this from the AdS-star graph can
be easily found using the general result () in Appendix B
. _4^star _lead.log =
g_4 ^6 2^9 N  1 (x_12 ^2x_34 ^2)^2 v^2[-
1 6 v+].
The contribution form the graviton exchanges is more complicated to
evaluate, since the graphs do not reduce into finite sums of conformal
integrals as in the four dimensional case. The direct channel graviton
exchange has been computed in for general dimensions, but
here we also need the crossed channels. After some tedious algebra
whose essentials are presented in Appendix B the final result is
. _4^grav _lead.log  = 1 2^6 2^9 N  
1 (x_12 ^2x_34 ^2)^2 v^2[-v].
Requiring that  we finally obtain
g_4=-3.
Discussion 

The critical three dimensional  vector model appears to be a very
interesting laboratory for the study of the AdS/CFT
correspondence. In contrast to most other cases of AdS/CFT, here it is
the boundary CFT side that is well understood at strong
coupling. This means that the correlation functions derived from
AdS/CFT coincide with the well-known correlation functions of the
interacting IR fixed point of the  vector model. Moreover, Legendre
transforming the generating functional of the IR fixed point one gets,
to leading order in the  expansion, the generating functional for
the free UV fixed point of the  vector model. Notice that the
assumption that the UV and IR generating functionals are related via a
Legendre transform is important dynamical information, in particular
for the IR fixed point. In the present
paper we initiate the evaluation of the AdS dual of the critical
 vector model making use of its connection with the IR fixed
point of the three dimensional CFT. Assuming a minimal form for the
bulk action i.e. without higher spin or derivative couplings, we evaluate the cubic
and quartic self interaction couplings of the bulk scalar that is dual
to the spin-zero "current" of the  model. 

The AdS dual of the  vector model is believed to
correspond to a higher 
spin theory. Therefore it should be possible to check our results
for the cubic couplings within the context of the
equations of motion of the minimal bosonic higher spin theory
. In particular, the vanishing of the cubic 
coupling was 
conjectured in to indicate a possible underlying discrete
symmetry for the operator . In the context of the higher
spin theory this symmetry may be a manifestation that the dual
operator of 
 might actually be a fermion bilinear.(I thank
P. Sundell for discussions on this point.)  

Our result () for the quartic bulk self interaction coupling
may not be directly applicable to finding the higher spin Lagrangian
Nevertheless, it is an intermediate result in this direction. For the
full result one would have to take into account the couplings of the
bulk scalar with higher spin fields. Since these couplings are
believed to be fixed, by finding the leading logarithm of
the higher spin exchange graphs in AdS one should be able to
unambiguously fix the quartic scalar self interaction coupling.
We expect such a calculation to be complicated but straightforward.

Another interesting class of questions that one can ask is the extension of
the bulk-boundary duality to higher orders in . At the field
theory side, there 
exist a number of results for the  corrections to  anomalous
dimensions. These
results should somehow be
reproduced by the bulk theory and this raises the intriguing
possibility that we are dealing here with a quantum gravity theory in AdS
that yields sensible results. Another important
quantity that has been calculated 
is the  correction to  in () which was found to decrease as one goes from
the UV to the IR fixed points of the  vector model
. Hence it appears to be a  natural extension of the
-function to odd dimensions and is a measure of the
degrees of freedom at the fixed point. Moreover, on the basis of the
results in, it was argued in that
the interacting IR fixed point of the  vector model describes
the symmetry
breaking pattern . For this reason, if the
degrees of freedom coupled to the UV free fixed point are , the
massless degrees of freedom coupled to the interacting fixed point are
. This raises a puzzle regarding the relation
between the free UV 
and interacting IR fixed points of the  vector model for
subleading . Finally, it is also intriguing that the leading-
free energies at the free UV and interacting IR fixed point of the
 vector model are different and related by a rational factor
4/5. This indicates that a holographic thermodynamical
study of the model may hide interesting surprises. We hope to return to
some of these issues in the near future.

Leading logarithmic singularities of AdS integrals 

Recall the definition of the cross ratios involved in the calculation
of conformal 4-pt functions
u=x_12 ^2x_34 ^2 x_13 ^2x_24 ^2  ,
v=x_12 ^2x_34 ^2 x_14 ^2x_23 ^2 , Y=1-v u .
Then, the general conformal 4-pt function can be expanded in the
variables  and  which makes it easier to read the contributions due
to various conformal tensors. For example the leading (in the limit
), contribution due to a tensor of
dimension  and rank  is of the formv^2  Y^k.
Using standard techniques for the calculation of AdS
graphs we can easily evaluate the first term on the rhs of ()
that corresponds to the AdS-star graph in Fig.1. We give for
completeness the result
g_4 ^6 2^9 N 
1 (x_12 ^2x_34 ^2)^2 v^2_n,m=0 ^ 
v^nY^m n!m! 
^2(2+n)^2(2+2n+m) (1+n)(4+n+m) 
[-v+2(4+2n+m). 
 . 
+2(1+n)-2(2+n)-2(2+n+m)].
To calculate the leading logarithm of the graviton exchange graph we
start with the integrals in () that come from the
hypergeometric function in (). For clarity we present here the
integral in the first line of (). Using the following
representation _2F_1(a,b;c;z) =(c) (a)(b) 1 2i   _C  s
(-s)(a+s)(b+s) (c+s)  (-z)^s,
with an appropriately chosen contour  parallel to the
imaginary axis and a standard Feynman parametrization we obtain
I^s_1 &=& 
^2 4 1 2i  _C s
(-s)(1+s)
I ^s_1,

I _1^s &=& _0^t_1..t_3 t_1^1+s t_2t_3
(t)^-4-s  [-1 t [t_1t_2 A_1
+t_1+t+3 A_2 +t_2t_3 A_3]],

t &=& t_1+t_2+t_3,
A_1=x_23 ^2 x_12 ^2x_13 ^2 
A_2=x_24 ^2 x_12 ^2x_14 ^2  
A_1=x_34 ^2 x_13 ^2x_14 ^2  . 
Next we set in ()
t_3 = _1_2_3, t_2=_1_2(1-_3),
t_3=_1(1-_2)  0_1<, 0_2,_31,
and do successively the  and  integrations with result
I _1^s = A_1^-2 B(2,2+s)
_0^1_3(1-_3)[1-_3 Y]^-2 
 2F_1(2,2;4+s;1-_3(1-_3)v 1-_3 Y ).
To obtain the leading logarithm now is suffices to set  in
(). Then, we may use the following representation for the
hypergeometric function1 2i  _C '  t
(-t)(c-a-b-t)(a+t)(b+t) (1-z)^t = 

= (c-a)
(c-b)(a)(b) (c)  _2F_1(a,b;c;z),
where  run parallel to the imaginary axis, and we do the
 integration to end up with a double Mellin-Barnes 
integral over  and 
. The  integration is straightforward while there are double
poles in the  integration. These are handled with the help of the
general formula1 2i  _C s ^2(-s) g(s) v^s =
_n=0 ^v^n (n!)^2 [2(1+n)g(n) -g(n)v
-  [g()]_Keeping only the leading term in  we obtain
.I_1^s_lead. log  =
(x_12 ^2x_13 ^2 x_23 ^2 )^2[-
v] ^2 24 . 
Following the same procedure we can find the leading logarithmic terms
in the direct channel as
.I_2^s_lead. log  &=&
(x_12 ^2x_13 ^2 x_23 ^2 )^2[-
v] 5^2 96 ,

.I_2^s_lead. log  &=&
(x_12 ^2x_13 ^2 x_23 ^2 )^2[-
v] 7^2 384 .
It is also easy to see, either by direct calculation or from the
results of that the  integrals do not have any
logarithmic terms. Then, from ()-() and
() we see that the leading logarithmic contribution in the direct channel
vanishes.

I general, the calculation of the crossed  and  channels is considerably more
complicated, but the extraction of the leading logarithms can be done
relatively easy on lines sketched above. For the  and 
integrals we find that their leading logarithms are exactly the same
as the ones of the corresponding  integrals. Therefore, their
contribution to the leading logarithm of the graviton exchange graph
vanishes. Hence, the only possible logarithms can come from the
crossed channel integrals  and .
Our calculation, done on the lines described above, yield for the
terms that give a non vanishing contribution
.I ^t_1_lead.log  = .I ^u_1_lead.log 
=-(x_12 ^2x_13 ^2 x_23 ^2 )^2[-
v] ^2 2 , 

.  I ^t_2_lead.log =.I ^u_2_lead.log  
=-(x_12 ^2x_13 ^2 x_23 ^2 )^2[-
v] ^2 4 .   
Using these result we obtain () in the main text.
