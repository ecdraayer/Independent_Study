Abstract. 
Being gauge non-invariant, a Chern-Simons -form seen as a 
Lagrangian of gauge theory on 
a -dimensional manifold leads to the gauge conservation law of a
modified Noether current. 


 
One usually considers the Chern-Simons (henceforth CS) gauge theory on
a principal bundle over a 3-dimensional manifold whose 
Lagrangian is the local 
CS form derived from the local
transgression formula for the second Chern form. 
This Lagrangian fails to be globally defined unless the above mentioned
principal bundle is trivial. Though the local CS Lagrangian is not
gauge-invariant, it leads to a (local) conservation law of the modified
Noether current. This result is also extended 
to the global CS theory on a 3-dimensional manifold. 
Its Lagrangian is well defined, but depends on a background gauge
potential. Therefore, it is gauge-covariant.
At the same time, the corresponding Euler-Lagrange operator 
is gauge invariant, and the above mentioned gauge
conservation law takes place. We aim to show that any higher-dimensional
CS theory admits such a conservation law.

There is the following general scheme of describing Lagrangian systems
on fibre bundles whose Euler-Lagrange operators are gauge-invariant,
but Lagrangians need not be so (see also).  

Let  be a smooth fibre bundle over an -dimensional base .
An -order Lagrangian is defined as a density 
on the -order jet manifold  of sections of 
(e.g.,). Let 
be a vertical vector field on  seen as 
an infinitesimal generator of a 
local one-parameter group of vertical bundle
automorphisms (gauge transformations) of . Let  be 
its prolongation onto . The following three formulas are
called into play.

(i) Let  denote the Lie derivative of 
along . The first variational formula provides its
canonical decomposition
r1 _J^ru L=uL + d_H(J^ruH_L), where  is the Euler-Lagrange operator of
,  is the total differential,  is a
Poincare-Cartan form of , and

is the corresponding Noether current along .

(ii) The master identity
r6 (_J^ru L)=_J^2r u (L) shows that the Euler-Lagrange
operator  of  is gauge-invariant 
iff the Lie derivative  is a variationally trivial
Lagrangian.  

(iii) 
An -order Lagrangian  is variationally trivial iff it
takes the form
r7 L=d_H+h_0() where  is an -form of jet order ,  is a closed
-form on , and  is the horizontal projection.
  
In the CS theories,  is an affine bundle. Therefore, 
its de Rham cohomology equals that of . 
Then, one obtains from the formulas () - () that
the Euler-Lagrange operator  of a Lagrangian  is 
gauge-invariant iff the Lie derivative 
of this Lagrangian takes the form 
r8 _J^ru L=d_H+, where  is a non-exact -form on the base . 
Let the Lie derivative () reduces to
the total differential 
r4 _J^ru L=d_H, e.g., it vanishes iff a Lagrangian  is gauge-invariant.
Then, the first variational formula () on Ker leads to
the equality
r5 0d_H(_u-), regarded as a conservation law of the modified Noether current
. 

Let us write the above formulas in the case of first order Lagrangians
. Given bundle coordinates  on a fibre bundle 
, its first and second jet manifolds  and 
 are equipped with the
adapted coordinates  and 
, respectively. 
We will use the notation  and
.
Given a first order Lagrangian 

on , the corresponding second order Euler-Lagrange operator reads
305 L= _idy^id_^_i)dy^i,
 
where 
 are the total 
derivatives, which yield the total differential 
r73 d_Hd_acting on the pull-back of exterior forms on  onto .
The kernel
Ker of the Euler-Lagrange operator ()
defines the Euler-Lagrange 
equations
.
Since 
r70 d_Hh_0=h_0d, a first order
Lagrangian  is variationally trivial iff 
mos11 L=h_0(), where
 is a closed -form on  and the horizontal projection  reads
r71 h_0(dx^)=dx^, h_0(dy^i)=y^i_dx^, h_0(dy^i_)=
y_ ^idx^. Let  be a vertical vector field 
on . Its jet prolongation onto  is
1.21 J^1u =u^i_i + d_u^i _i^. The Lie derivative of a Lagrangian  along  
reads
04 _J^1u L=d(J^1uL) + J^1udL=(u^i_i 
+d_u^i^_i). Accordingly, the first variational formula () takes the form
bC30' _J^1u L= u^i_i+ d_^, where the Noether current along  reads
r41 _u=^_u^i_i^_. Now, let us turn to gauge theory of principal connections on a
principal bundle  with a structure  
Lie group . Let  be the first order jet manifold of 
and 
r43 C=J^1P/GX the quotient of  with respect to the canonical action of  on
 (e.g.,).  
There is one-to-one correspondence between the principal connections on
 and the sections of the fibre bundle 
(), called the 
connection bundle. Given an atlas  of , the connection bundle
 is provided with bundle 
coordinates  such that, for any its section , the
local functions  are coefficients of the
familiar local connection form. From the physical viewpoint, 
is a gauge potential.

 The infinitesimal 
generators of local one-parameter groups of vertical 
automorphism (gauge transformations) of the principal bundle 
are -invariant vertical vector fields on . There
is one-to-one correspondence between these vector fields and the sections of
the quotient 
r44 V_GP=VP/GX of the vertical tangent bundle  of  with respect to the
canonical action of  on . The typical fibre of
 is the right Lie algebra  of the Lie group , acting
on this typical fibre by the adjoint representation. Given an atlas
 of  and a basis  for the Lie algebra , we
obtain the 
fibre bases  for . If  and
 are sections of , their bracket is
[,]=c^r_pq ^p^q e_r,
where  are the structure constants of .
Note that the connection bundle  () is an affine bundle
modelled over the vector bundle , and elements of  are
represented by local -valued 1-forms 
. 
The infinitesimal generators of gauge transformations of
the connection bundle  are vertical vector fields
r47 _C=(_^r +c^r_pq a^p_^q)^_r. The connection bundle  admits the canonical -valued 2-form
r60 dx^+12 c^r_pq a^p_a^q_dx^dx^)e_r, which is the curvature of the canonical connection on the principal
bundle  (e.g.,). 
Given a section  of , the pull-back  
r47' && F_A=A^*F^r_ dx^dx^e_r,

 
&& F^r_ =_A^r_A^r_+c^r_pq A^p_A^q_,
of  onto  is the strength form of a gauge potential .  

Turn now to the CS forms.
Let  be a -invariant
polynomial of degree  on the Lie algebra  written with
respect to its basis , i.e.,
I_k()=_j b_r_1r_k ^r_1 c^r_j _pq e^p^r_k =
kb_r_1r_k c^r_1 _pq ^p^r_2 ^r_k =0.
Let us associate to  the gauge-invariant -form 
r61 P_2k ()=b_r_1r_k ^r_1 ^r_k  on . It is a closed form due to the equalities
&& dP_2k ()=_j b_r_1r_k ^r_1 
d^r_j ^r_k = 

&& _j b_r_1r_k ^r_1 
c^r_j _pq  ^p a^q_dx^^r_k =

&& (_j b_r_1r_k ^r_1 
c^r_j _pq  ^p ^r_k )a^q_dx^Let  be a section of . Then, the pull-back 
r63 P_2k (F_A)=A^*P_2k () of  is a closed characteristic form on . Recall that
the de Rham cohomology of  equals that of  since 
is an affine bundle. It follows that  and  possess
the same  
cohomology class 
r62 [P_2k ()]=[P_2k (F_A)] for any principal connection . Thus, 
 
is the familiar Weil homomorphism.

Let  be a fixed section of the connection bundle .
Given the characteristic form  () on , let the same
symbol stand for its pull-back onto . By virtue of the equality 
(), the difference  is an exact form on .
Moreover, similarly to the well-known transgression formula on a
principal bundle , one can obtain the following transgression formula
on :
r64,5 && P_2k ()-P_2k (F_B)=d_2k-1 (B), 

&&  _2k-1 (B)=k^1_0 _2k (t,B)dt, 

&& _2k (t,B)=b_r_1r_k (a^r_1 __1 -B^r_1 __1 )dx^_1 ^r_2 (t,B)^r_k (t,B),

&& ^r_j (t,B)=
[d(ta^r_j __j  +(1-t)B^r_j __j )dx^_j  +

&& 12c^r_j _pq 
(ta^p__j  +(1-t)B^p__j )(ta^q__j  +(1-t)B^q__j )dx^_j 
dx^_j ]e_r.
Its pull-back by means of a section  of  gives
the transgression formula
P_2k (F_A)-P_2k (F_B)=d S_2k-1 (A,B)
on . For instance, if  is the characteristic Chern -form,
then  is the familiar CS -form. 
Therefore, we agree to call 
() the CS form on the connection bundle . 
In particular, one can choose the local section . 
Then,  is
the local CS form. Let  denote its pull-back 
onto  by means of a section  of . Then, the CS form
 admits the decomposition
r75 _2k-1 (B)=_2k-1  -S_2k-1 (B) +dK_2k-1 (B). Let  be the first order jet manifold of the
connection bundle  equipped with the adapted coordinates
. 
Let us consider the pull-back of the CS form () onto 
denoted by the same symbol , and let 
r74 _2k-1 (B)=h_0 _2k-1 (B) be its horizontal projection.
This is given by the formula
&& _2k-1 (B)=k^1_0 _2k (t,B)dt, 

&& _2k (t,B)=b_r_1r_k (a^r_1 __1 -B^r_1 __1 )dx^_1 ^r_2 (t,B)^r_k (t,B),

&& ^r_j (t,B)= 12[
ta^r_j __j_j  +(1-t)__j B^r_j __j 
- ta^r_j __j_j  -(1-t)__j B^r_j __j )+

&& 12c^r_j _pq 
(ta^p__j  +(1-t)B^p__j )(ta^q__j  +(1-t)B^q__j ]dx^_j 
dx^_j e_r.
Now, let us consider the CS gauge model on a -dimensional base
manifold  whose Lagrangian 
r80 L_CS =_2k-1 (B) is the CS form () on . Clearly, this Lagrangian is not
gauge-invariant. 
Let  () be the infinitesimal generator of gauge
transformations of the connection bundle . 
Its jet prolongation onto  is
J^1_C=^r_^_r + d_^r_^ _r.
 The Lie derivative of the Lagrangian
 along  reads
r81 _J^1_C  _2k-1 (B)= J^1_Cd(h_0_2k-1 (B))
=_J^1_C (h_0 _2k-1 (B)). 
A direct computation shows that
_J^1_C (h_0 _2k-1 (B))=h_0(__C _2k-1 (B))
=h_0(_Cd_2k-1 (B)+ d(_C_2k-1 (B)) .
By virtue of the transgression formula (), we have
d(_Cd_2k-1 (B))=__C (d_2k-1 (B))=
__C P_2k ()=0.
It follows that  is a closed form on , 
i.e.,
_Cd_2k-1 (B)=d+ ,
where  is a non-exact -form on . Moreover,  since
, , does not contain terms linear in .
Hence, the Lie derivative () takes the form () where
_J^1_C  _2k-1 (B)=d_H ,
+ _C_2k-1 (B)).
As a consequence, the CS theory with the Lagrangian () admits
the conservation law (). 

In a more general setting, one can
consider the sum of the CS Lagrangian () and some
gauge-invariant Lagrangian.

For instance, let  be a semi-simple group and  
the Killing form on . Let 
r48 P()=h 2 a^G_mn ^m^n be the second Chern form up to a constant multiple. Given a section  of
, the transgression formula
() on  reads
r49 P()-P(F_B)=d_3(B), 
where  is the CS 3-form up to a constant multiple. 
Let us a consider the gauge model on a 3-dimensional base manifold
whose Lagrangian is the sum 
r89 L= L_CS +L_inv of the CS Lagrangian
r50 &&L_CS =h_0(_3(B))=
ha^G_mn  ^ [12a^m_(^n_  -13
c^n_pq a^p_a^q_)-  

&& 12B^m_(F(B)^n_  -13
c^n_pq B^p_B^q_)
-d_(a^m_B^n_)]d^3x, 

&& ^r_ dx^dx^e_r, ^r_ =a^r_ -a^r_  +c^r_pq a^p_a^q_.
and some gauge-invariant Lagrangian 
r85 L_inv = _inv (x^,a^r_,a^r_ ,z^A,z^A_)d^3x of gauge potentials and matter fields. Then, the first variational
formula () on-shell takes the form
r86 _J^1_C L_CS d_H(_CS  +_inv ), where  is the Noether current of the CS Lagrangian
() and  is that of the gauge-invariant
Lagrangian (). A simple calculation gives
&& _J^1_C L_CS =-d_(ha^G_mn ^ (_^m a^n_+
(_^m +c^m_pq a^p_^q) B^n_))d^3x,

&& _CS ^mn ^ (_^m
+c^m_pq a^p_^q)(a^n_B^n_). 
Substituting these expression into the weak equality (), we
come to the conservation law 
0d_[ha^G_mn ^ (2_^a^n_+
c^m_pq a^p_b a^n_^q)+ _inv ^]
of the modified Noether current
mn ^ (2_^a^n_+
c^m_pq a^p_b a^n_^q)+ _inv ^.
