The and the four-dimensional =4 superconformal 
algebras play important roles in superstring theories. 
It is often discussed the roles of the algebra as a maximal 
extension of the superalgebras in flat background. 
In this paper we show that  the su(2,24), the super-AdS 
algebra or the superconformal algebra, is not a restriction of the osp(132)
though the bosonic part of the former is a subgroup of the latter. 
There exist only two types of u(1) extension of the algebra if 
the bosonic covariance is imposed. 
Possible significance of the results is also discussed briefly.

Introduction All possible extensions of the super-Poincare algebra
correspond to branes that can exist on the flat background.
The maximal extension of the super-Poincare algebra in 10 dimensions
contains 32 supercharges
and 528 bosonic generators (in addition to Lorentz generators). 
It is the osp(132) algebra and the symmetries of IIA, IIB, M and F 
theories have been examined systematically.(
Superalgebras
with a larger number of supercharges than 32
have been discussed in.) 

A D-brane action consists of a Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action
and a Wess-Zumino (WZ) action.
The WZ action is needed for the total action to possess -symmetry,
which allows to project out half of the world-volume fermions
and matches bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom on the 
world-volume.
It was shown that 
commutation relations among two of the Noether charges
do not close but include topological brane charges, 
because the WZ action is quasi-superinvariant. 
In other words, the super-Poincare algebra is modified
to include topological brane charges and becomes
the extended super-Poincare algebra with brane charges(
The brane charge is not a center of the extended super-Poincare algebra,
because they have non-trivial commutation relations with Lorentz generators.
These brane charges are ideal of the extended super-Poincare algebra,
and the original algebra is represented as a coset,
(the extended super-Poincare algebra)/ideal.
) .
The half of the 32 supercharges are those for Nambu-Goldstone (NG) fermions
associated with supersymmetries broken by the brane.
In fact, for a given brane configuration
with the brane tension being equal to the brane charge,
anti-commutation relation of two
of supercharges turns out to be proportional to a projection
operator which projects out half of the supersymmetries
on the vacuum.

These brane backgrounds are constructed as solutions of supergravity theories.
Constructing  Killing vectors and spinors in a brane background,
one can show that the super-isometry algebra contains a smaller number of
supercharges than 32.
In order to recover (super)symmetries broken by the brane,
one examines small fluctuations around this solution.
The broken symmetries are recovered in terms of NG fields
and the resulting superalgebra contains 32 supercharges and brane charges.

For a curved background, 
D-brane actions are shown to be -symmetric
if the background satisfies the field equations
of the target space supergravity.
Since the AdS background is a solution of type-IIB supergravity,
one can construct -symmetric D-brane action on it.
Such D-brane actions have been examined in.
The amount of unbroken supersymmetries are determined by the balance between
the -symmetry projection and Killing spinor equations.

One expects that the WZ action for such a brane produces 
brane charges in the superalgebra su(2,24), which is the 
super-isometry algebra of the AdS background,
and the maximal extension is osp(132),
referring the classification by Nahm.
The anti-commutator between two of supercharges are examined 
in for a matrix theory on the eleven-dimensional pp-wave and 
in for a superstring action on the AdS background,
and are shown to include brane charges.
However, the full supersymmetry algebra has not been derived yet 
because of the complexity.
To derive the full supersymmetry algebra,
one may try to examine small fluctuations around a D-brane solution
of a supergravity theory.
But supergravity solutions for D-branes in the AdS background
have not been known well yet.

In  order to achieve this, we take another route in this paper.
We examine the osp(132) and relations to
the super-AdS algebra, su(2,24).
The bosonic AdS algebra,
so(4,2)so(6), is a subalgebra of sp(32).
However, su(2,24) is not a subalgebra of osp(132)
because commutation relations, for example , differ each other.
Algebraically, 
the osp(132) is not an extension of su(2,24) because
sp(32) is not an extension of so(4,2)so(6).



In this paper
we find that the su(2,24) is not a restriction of the osp(132)
in the following sense. Expressing the osp(132) algebra in an AdS
 covariant basis and restricting the bosonic generators of sp(32) to 
those of so(4,2)so(6),
 the resulting commutation relations have forms of algebra 
apart from some sign differences.  
We find that they 
are neither those for the 
su(2,24) nor a consistent superalgebra.  
This is essentially because the Fierz identity for the one hand does not
imply that for the other hand.
The same argument is true for the four-dimensional  superconformal 
algebra.

In the reverse, we examine possible generalizations
of the super-AdS algebra.
When we consider some (brane) solutions in the background 
they break also manifest  and/or  covariance.
However it is a spontaneous symmetry breaking
in the presence of a particular solution. 
The covariance of the theory would be still maintained. 
Thus,
we impose the assumption that the bosonic AdS algebra
is a subalgebra of the bosonic part of the superalgebra with brane charges,
and find that only two trivial types of u(1) extension of the
super-AdS algebra are allowed.


This paper is organized as follows.
In the next section, 
we express  the osp(132) algebra in an AdS covariant basis.
In section 3, we show that the super-AdS algebra is not a 
restriction of the osp(132) algebra.
In section 4, we find that only two types of u(1) extension of the
super-AdS algebra are allowed,
under the assumption that bosonic AdS algebra is a subalgebra of
the bosonic part of the superalgebra with brane charges.
The section 5 is devoted to a summary and discussions on possible significance.
The uniqueness of the osp(132) algebra is presented in appendix A. 
In appendix B, complementary to the section 3,
we show that the four-dimensional =4 superconformal algebra is not
a restriction of osp(132),
by clarifying the relation between generators of 
the super-AdS algebra
and those of the four-dimensional =4 superconformal algebra.

The supersymmetric algebra is the su(2,24)
and has been extensively discussed in the superstring context. 
It has the same supercharge contents as those of . 
As the is maximally
generalized superalgebra the anti-commutator of two 
supercharges contains all bosonic charges as ospqq2 
while that of  contains only bosonic charges. 
In this sense cannot be a subalgebra of . 
In this section we examine if the algebra is 
obtained by a "restriction" of the algebra or not.(
The "restriction" means 
1) dropping the commutation relations for the extra generators
, 
, and
2) dropping the extra generators appearing in the r.h.s. of the 
(anti-)commutators. ) 
In other words if the is any generalized superalgebra associated 
with the .

The  commutators of the  algebra are given in ospqz2  
and those for generators are read as
[ Q _ ,a ] = 12(Q _a (-i_0))_&,   &
[ Q _ ,a' ] = 12(Q _a' _0)_

[ Q _ab ] = 12(Q _ba )_[ Q _a'b' ] = 12(Q _b'a' )_They show the covariance  of  under the bosonic transformations,

in QQADS  have different signs.
If we adjust the value  so that 
the coefficients of  and  in QQOSP  and QQADS  
coincide, those of   and   have
opposite signs , and vise versa  for .

The sign difference is required by the closure of the algebra.
The () Jacobi identity of QQOSP 
holds due to the presence of all generators in the r.h.s. of the

In summary we have shown that the supersymmetric algebra is not  
a restriction of the  and maximal generalization of 
the algebra, if any, is not the  superalgebra. 
In appendix B we obtain the same result for the superconformal algebra
in 4 dimensions as it is also isomorphic to the su(2,24).  
 


Extensions of the super-AdS S algebra In the last section we have shown the algebra is not 
a restriction of the  .
In this section we will find possible generalization 
of the . 
"Generalization" 
here means that the algebra is obtained by 
a restriction of the generators to those of in the 
generalized algebras.
In the generalized algebras we keep the covariance under . 
When we consider some (brane) solutions in the background 
they break also manifest  and/or  covariance.
However it is a spontaneous symmetry breaking
in the presence of a particular solution. 
The covariance of the theory would be still maintained. 
Thus
we impose the assumption that the bosonic AdS algebra
is a subalgebra of the bosonic part of the superalgebra with brane charges.

 

Now we try to add bosonic generators on the algebra so that the
commutators satisfy the . 
We classify possible forms of the bosonic generators in the basis 
of Gsymgam  as

satisfies the Jacobi relation for each subalgebra of subalg2

For the  algebra there is no consistent solution.

Summary and Discussions  We have shown that the su(2,24), the super-AdS algebra or 
the four-dimensional =4 superconformal algebra, 
is not a restriction of the osp(132).
The situation is the same for the super-pp-wave algebra as it is obtained by
the Penrose limit of the super-AdS algebra. 
In addition, we have shown that
under the assumption that bosonic AdS algebra is a subalgebra of
the bosonic part of the superalgebra with brane charges,
only two trivial types of u(1) extension of the super-AdS
algebra are allowed.

Our results suggest that
the generalized  superalgebra associated with branes
in the AdS background, if any,
cannot be any generalization 
of the super-AdS algebra which contains 
the super-AdS algebra as a restriction.
This is completely different from the flat case,
where extended superalgebra with brane charges contains
the super-Poincare algebra as a restriction.
The property that brane charge affects the algebra associated
with the background may be related to a back reaction of the brane
on the background. 
If this is the case, the brane probe analysis on the extended superalgebra
must be modified appropriately.

There are possible ways to obtain generalized  superalgebras
with brane charges corresponding to
branes in the AdS background.
First,
one examines all possible commutation relations among two of Noether charges.
Secondly,
one examines small fluctuations around a brane solution in the 
AdS
background of supergravity.
Such a solution is not known well yet.
Recently, D-brane supergravity solutions in the pp-wave background
were constructed.
One may construct a generalized  superalgebra with the brane charge
recovering (super)symmetries broken by the brane.
Thirdly, it is known that an intersection solution
of a stack of D3-branes and a D-brane in flat background
is transformed to a D-brane solution in the AdS background
under a near-horizon limit.
One expects that the extended super-Poincare algebra
with D3- and D-brane charges
is transformed to a generalized  superalgebra
with a D-brane charge associated with
a D-brane solution in the AdS background.
In order to show this,
at first, we must derive the AdS algebra
from the super Poincare algebra with D3-brane charges.
We leave these issues for future investigations.

 Uniqueness of the algebra  
We show that any maximally generalized  
supersymmetric algebra 
is expressed in the form of ospqq -ospzz  by redefinitions
explicitly. 
In a maximally generalized 
 algebra  independent 
bosonic charges appear in the anti-commutator of the 
-supercharges , (in the present case ).   
Then the bosonic charges  are defined by 
the first equation ospqq  
 _   &&_ ,_  
=  _   .
In the closed algebra 
 is odd and generally written as
[ _ , _   ]&=&[ _ ,_ ,_ ] 
= _ ^ _ ,   ,     
^ _ ,    = ^ _ ,   .
The  Jacobi identity 
_cyclic     [_,_,_] = 0,    
requires
_cyclic     ^ _ ,   &=&0.
The  Jacobi  identity requires
[  _   , _   ]&=& _(   
^ _ ),     = 
-  _(   ^ _ ),    .
 
The last equality comes from anti-symmetry under 
. It follows 
^  _(   ^  _ ),     + ^  _(   
^  _ ),     + 
(  ) = 0.
 
By contraction with 
(N+1) ^  _ ,     + 
^  _   ^  _ ,     + 
^  _(   ^  _ ),     = 0.
By further contraction with  we find
^  _ ,     = 0
and then
^  _ ,    &=&

^  _(   _  ) ,     
_   1 (N+1)  ^  _ ,    .
The cyclic condition cyclic  means anti-symmetry of 
 and ospqz1  return to the 
form of ospqz 
[ _ , _   ]&=&
_(  _  ) .
The bosonic algebra ospzz1  becomes symplectic form, , 
[  _   , _   ]&=&
 _(   ^ _) ,     = 
 _ (  _  )  +  _ (  _  ) 
which coincide with ospzz . 
All the Jacobi identities hold identically. 

In getting omega1  we have assumed that all bosonic generators
 appear in the right hand of the 
 anti-commutator ospqq1 . 
For a non-maximally generalized  superalgebra  
's are not independent and
omega1  no more holds.
The Jacobi identity is not trivially satisfied 
but is examined case by case. 

osp(132) and four-dimensional =4 superconformal 
algebra 
In this appendix we show that  
the superconformal algebra  is also not a restriction of the

P_a  = Z_a && M_a ,      Z_ab   M_ab .
The so(4,2) algebra is
[M_AB ,M_CD ]&=&_BC M_AD + 3 terms ,
where 
 and 
The sign of the metric in  direction comes from 
[M_a ,M_b ] = 
M_ab  = -_  M_ab .
The conformal generators in 4 dimensions can be composed as

it is inverted as
M_a'b' &=&12 tr (U_b'a' ),

Here the bosonic generators other than the ones are 's and
. 
These commutators are consistent under the conjugations QSconj . 
For example the conjugation of the acQdS  gives acSdQ .
We have written the algebra in terms of generators and other 
bosonic generators 's. 
The commutators bosonconf , SU4alg , bSMcom -
QM42  
have the same forms as those of the algebra. For the anti-commutators
of the supercharges bQbQ -bSbS ,
if we would drop the bosonic generators 's other than 
 and ,
they appear those of the algebra
except that the signs in front of the  terms are reversed. 
The reason is the same as the case. The restriction of the extra generators 
's from the is not sufficient to guarantee the Jacobi identities.
In order to do it, it is necessary to reverse the signs of the   
terms in the  anti-commutators of the supercharges 
since SU(4) generator   is related to the  generators
by defU  and cycladsJ  is applied. 

The generalization  of the algebra is discussed
as was done in the case of the in section 4. 
It is not generalized  up to maximal but only two types of u(1) extension
are allowed. The U(1) generator  can be combined with the SU(4) 
generator  to form a U(4) generator.
