In the present article, we study the space-time geometry felt by
probe bosonic string moving in antisymmetric and dilaton background fields.
This space-time geometry we shall call the stringy geometry. In particular,
the presence of the antisymmetric field leads to the space-time torsion, and
the presence of the dilaton field leads to the space-time nonmetricity. We
generalize the geometry of surfaces embedded in space-time to the case when
torsion and nonmetricity are present. We define the mean extrinsic curvature
for Minkowski signature and introduce the concept of mean torsion. Its
orthogonal projection defines the dual mean extrinsic curvature. In this
language, one field equation is just the equality of mean extrinsic curvature
and dual mean extrinsic curvature, which we call C-duality relation. In the
torsion and nonmetricity free case, the world-sheet is a minimal surface,
specified by the requirement that mean extrinsic curvature vanishes.
Generally, it is stringy C-dual surface. In the presence
of the dilaton field, which breaks conformal invariance, the conformal factor
which connects intrinsic and induced metrics, is determined as a function of
the dilaton field itself. We also derive the integration measure for the
space-time with stringy nonmetricity. 

Bosonic string, Torsion, Nonmetricity, Minimal and C-dual surfaces 






Introduction 

In the paper, we investigated classical dynamics of the bosonic
string in the background metric, antisymmetric and dilaton fields. The
starting Lagrangian has been used in the literature , in
order to study the two-dimensional conformal invariance on the quantum level.
In those papers the classical space-time equations of motion have been
obtained from the world-sheet quantum conformal invariance.

In the ref., we made classical canonical nonperturbative
investigations, treating world-sheet fields as variables in the theory and
space-time fields as a background depending on the coordinates . We
obtained the nonlinear realization of the Virasoro generators. We also derived
the Hamiltonian  equations of motion and shortly discussed the target space
torsion and nonmetricity, recognized by the string.

In the present paper, we are going to investigate in detail the space-time
geometry felt by the string, and offer geometrical interpretation of the
equations of motion. In Sec. 2, we will consider general theory of surfaces
embedded in space-time with torsion and nonmetricity, and in Secs. 3 and 4
we will apply this results to the bosonic string theory in the background
fields.

Starting with the known rules of the space-time parallel transport, in Sec. 2
we introduce the torsion and nonmetricity. We decompose the arbitrary
connection in terms of the Christoffel one, contortion and nonmetricity. Then
we define the induced world-sheet variables: metric tensor and connection, and
extrinsic one: second fundamental form (SFF). The world-sheet tangent vector,
after parallel transport along world-sheet line with space-time connection is
not necessarily a tangent vector. Its world-sheet projection defines the
induced connection and its normal projection defines the SFF. When the metric
postulate is not valid, there are two forms of the world-sheet connections and
two forms of SFF. The two forms, of both the connection and the SFF, differ by
terms proportional to the nonmetricity. We also introduce the induced torsion
and induced nonmetricity and find the relations between space-time and
world-sheet covariant derivatives. We generalized the geometrical
interpretation of the SFF to the case where the space-time has nontrivial
torsion and nonmetricity. In the standard approach the torsion does not
contribute to the mean extrinsic curvature (MEC) . We define
dual mean extrinsic curvature (DMEC)  as an orthogonal projection
of the mean torsion. This enables us to define the self-dual (self-antidual)
condition, under C-duality .

In Sec. 3, we formulate the bosonic string theory and shortly repeat some
results of ref., such as canonical derivation of the equations of
motion. We independently derive the Lagrangian equations of motion and connect
them to the previous ones. We introduce the stringy space-time felt by the
probe string and find the expressions for stringy torsion and stringy
nonmetricity.

In Sec. 4, we investigate contributions of the background fields to the
space-time geometry. The equations of motion with respect to the intrinsic
world-sheet metric relate this intrinsic metric with the induced one. In the
absence of the dilaton field , the theory is conformally  invariant, so
that the intrinsic metric tensor is equal to the induced one up to the
conformal factor . The presence of the dilaton field breaks the
conformal invariance and determines this conformal factor.

Equations of motion, obtained by variation with respect to , have 
components. Two of them determine the contracted intrinsic connection in terms
of the corresponding induced expression. The other  are of the form
, where  is stringy MEC
and  are the two forms of DMEC. They define world-sheet as
a stringy C-dual (antidual) surface. In two particular cases, -the vanishing
torsion and the vanishing nonmetricity- the field equations turn to the
equations of stringy minimal world-sheet  and C-dual
(antidual) world-sheet , respectively. In the
case of Riemann space-time, when both torsion and nonmetricity vanish, they
turn to the equations of minimal world-sheet .

The presence of the space-time metric  produces just the standard
Christoffel connection. In this case, the string can see the space-time as
Riemannian one. The field strength of the antisymmetric tensor contributes to
the space-time torsion. So, string with background fields  and
 feels Riemann-Cartan space-time. Finally, the dilaton field
 produces the nonmetricity of the space-time. The target space observed
by the string, when all three background fields , 
and  are present, we will call the stringy space-time.

In sec. 5, we consider the possible forms of the space-time action. We obtain
the new integration measure for spaces with nonmetricity from the requirements
that the measure is preserved under parallel transport and that it enables
integration by parts. We discuss how our action is related to the action of
the papers.

Appendix A is devoted to the world-sheet geometry, and Appendix B to the
classification of space-time geometry and to the world-sheet as an embedded surface.

Geometry of surfaces embedded in space-time with torsion and nonmetricity 

The geometry of surfaces, when the world-sheet is embedded in
curved space-time, has been investigated in the literature, see
. In this section we will generalize these results for
the space-times with nontrivial torsion and nonmetricity. For some
details of the subsection 2.1 see refs..

Geometry of space-time with torsion and nonmetricity 

In the curved spaces, the operations on tensors are covariant only if they are
realized in the same point. In order to compare the vectors from different
points we need the rule for parallel transport. The parallel transport of the
vector , from the point  to the point , produce the vector
, where
 ^V^= -  ^_ ^V^d x^  .  ptcn 
The variable  is the affine linear connection .
The rule for the parallel transport of the covector ,
can be obtained from the requirement that the invariant vector product is not changed
under parallel transport , so that
 ^U_=   ^_ ^U_d x^  .
Now, we are able to compare vectors from the points  and , and define the covariant derivative
 ^D V^= V^(x+dx) -  ^V^_= d V^-  ^V^=
(_V^+  ^_ ^V^) d x^ ^D_V^d x^   .
Let us define the geodesic line  as a self-parallel line,
which means that the tangent vector , stay parallel
after parallel transport . It produce the equation
x ^+  ^^_  x ^x ^0    ,
stating that the covariant derivative along the geodesic is zero
.

The connection is not necessary symmetric in the lower indices, and its
antisymmetric part is the torsion 
 ^T^_  = ^^_  -  ^^_    .
It has a simple geometrical interpretation. Consider two geodesics 
and , starting at the point , with the corresponding unit tangent
vectors , (Fig. 1). Let us
perform parallel transport of the vector , along geodesic ,
to the point  at the distance . The final vector we
denote by . It defines direction of the geodesic
, which starts at the point  and ends at the point ,
at the distance . Similarly, we perform parallel
transport of the vector , along geodesic , to the point 
at the distance . We obtain the vector ,
which determines the geodesic . The point , lies on the
geodesic  at the distance  from
point .

        [Example]Geometrical meaning of the torsion.  
     

In the curved space-time, this figure is not necessary closed. The difference
of the coordinates at the points  and 
is proportional to the torsion
x^(D_2) - x^(D_1)  =  ^T^ _  t_1^ t_2^ d _1  d _2       .       cod 
In fact the torsion measures the non-closure of the "rectangle"  .

The metric tensor   is a new variable, independent on the connection.
This is a non-degenerate symmetric tensor, which enables us to calculate scalar product
, in order to measure lengths and angles.

We already learned, that covariant derivative is responsible for the
comparison of the vectors from different points. What variable is responsible
for comparison of the lengths of the vectors? The square of the length of the
vector  is . The square of
the length of its parallel transport to the point , is  

. Let us stress, that we used the local metric tensors in both
expressions and realized the parallel transport with the connection 
. If we remember the invariance of the scalar product
under the parallel transport, than the difference of the squares of the
vectors is
 ^V^2 =   ^V_^2 (x+dx) - V^2 (x)  =
[G_ (x+dx) - G_ (x) -  ^G_ (x)]
  ^V^_   ^V^_   .
Up to the higher terms we have
 ^V^2 =  [d G_ (x) -  ^G_ (x)] V^V^=
  ^D G_  V^V^- d x^  ^ Q_  V^V^  , len 
where we introduced the nonmetricity  as a covariant derivative of the metric tensor
 ^Q_ =-  ^D_G_     .  nm 
Beside the lengths, the nonmetricity also changes the angle between the vectors
 and , according to the relation
 ^( ( V_1 , V_2)) =  1 2 V_1^2 V_2^2   
[2 V_1^V_2^- ( V_1^V_1^V_1^2  + V_2^V_2^V_2^2  ) (V_1 V_2) ]
 ^Q_  d x^  .    ang 
Note that we performed the parallel transport of the vectors, but not of the
metric tensor. It means that for length calculation in the point , we
used the metric tensor , which lives in the same point,
and not the tensor  obtained after
parallel transport from the point . The requirement for the equality of
these two tensors is known in the literature as a metric postulate. In fact,
it is just some kind of compatibility between the metric and connection, such
that metric after parallel transport is equal to the local metric. Here we
will not accept this requirement, because the difference of these two tensors
is the origin of the nonmetricity. So, the nonmetricity measures the
deformation of lengths and angles during the parallel transport .

We also define the Weyl vector as
 ^Q_= 1 D  G^   ^Q_         ,     wv 
where  is the number of space-time dimensions. When the traceless part of
the nonmetricity vanishes
 ^_   ^Q_  - G_   ^Q_=0            ,   ap 
the parallel transport preserves the angles but not the lengths. Such geometry
is known as a Weyl geometry.

Following the paper, we can decomposed the given connection
 in terms of the Christoffel connection,
contortion and nonmetricity. If we introduce the Schouten braces according to
the relation
  = + -        ,
then the Christoffel connection coG , can be expressed as 
.
The contortion  is defined in terms of the torsion
 ^K_  = 1 2   ^T_     =
1 2  ( ^T_  +  ^T_  -  ^T_ )      .  K 
By definition, the contortion is antisymmetric under first two indices 
.

The Schouten braces of the nonmetricity can be solved in terms of the connection
 ^_,  = _,  +  ^K_  +
1 2   ^Q_         .     cde 
The first term is the Christoffel connection , which depends on the metric but
which does not transforms as a tensor. The second one is the contortion K 
and the third one is Schouten braces of the nonmetricity nm . The last two
terms transform as a tensors.

The first and third terms are symmetric in  indices. In the
second term we can separate symmetric and antisymmetric parts, 

, where he symmetric part of the arbitrary tensor 
 we denote as 
. Consequently, we have
 ^^_  =  ^^_()  + 1 2   ^T^_    .
Induced and extrinsic geometry 

Let  be the coordinates of the 
dimensional space-time  and 
the coordinates of two dimensional world-sheet , spanned by the
string. The corresponding derivatives we will denote as 
 and 
. We will use the local space-time basis, relating with
the coordinate one by the vielbein 
. Here,  is
local world-sheet basis and  are local unit
vectors, normal to the world-sheet.

The two dimensional induced metric tensor is defined by the requirement, that
any world-sheet interval measured by the target space metric, has the same
length as measured by the induced one. For a given space-time metric tensor
, the world-sheet induced metric tensor  takes the form
G_  = G_  _x^_x^  .  imt 
Similarly, the induced metric of a  dimensional space, normal to the
world-sheet, is . The mixed induced
metric tensor ,
vanishes by definition.

The world-sheet projection and the orthogonal projection of the arbitrary
space-time covector , we will denote as
v_= _x^V_  , v_i = n_i^V_   .      pr 
In the space-time basis, tangent and normal vectors to the world-sheet
 can be expressed respectively as
V^_=  _x^v^   ,
V^_=  n_i^v^i     .
a) Parallel transport of the world-sheet tangent covectors.  Let us
perform the parallel transport of the covector  along
world-sheet line, from the point  to the point 
, using the space-time connection 
(Fig. 2). We obtain the covector
 ^V^_  = V^_+  ^V^_ ,  ptv 
where
 ^V_^= ^^_  V_^d x^= ^^_ 
V_^_x^d ^  .
In the local basis, at the point , its world-sheet projection
has the form
 ^v_ ^= _x^(+ d )  ^V^_     .

        [Example]Definition of the induced connection 
          and SFF 
        
        from the parallel transport of the world-sheet tangent covector.
        Here  

 and  
. 
     

Let us introduce the world-sheet induced connection  
. We demand that it defines the rule of the parallel transport of the
world-sheet covector , along the same world-sheet line, to
the projection . So, we have by
definition
 ^v_ ^= v_+ ^v_  ,  ptd 
where
 ^v_= ^^_  v_d ^  .  ptw 
It produce the expression for the induced connection
 ^^_  = G^  _x^G_ 
( ^_ ^_x^_x^+  __x^)=
G^  _x^G_ 
 ^D__x^  , icn 
where 
is space-time covariant derivative along world-sheet direction.

The orthogonal projection of the covector 
, defines the second fundamental form , 
, trough the equation
n_i^(+ d )  ^V^_ 
 ^v^_i  = -  ^b _i  v^d ^   ,
or explicitly
 ^b _i   = n_i^  ^ D_( G_  _x^)
 = -  _x^G_   ^ D_n_i^  .    sff2 
The SFF define the extrinsic geometry.

b) Parallel transport of the world-sheet orthogonal covectors.  If we
perform parallel transport of the covector , orthogonal to the
world-sheet (Fig. 3), we obtain
 ^V^_  = V^_  +  ^V^_ 
  ,   ^V^_ =  ^^_  V^_  d x^=
 ^^_  V^_  _x^d
^   .
Its normal projection, defines the induced connection of the  dimensional
space, normal to the world-sheet
 ^^i_j   = G^i k  n^_k   G_   ^D_n^_j
  ,
and its world-sheet projection defines also the SFF, which we denote by

_x^(+ d )  ^V^_   ^v^_ 
= v^i   ^b_i   d ^  .
file=partrort.eps,width=13cm 
        [Example]Definition of the induced connection  
        and SFF   from the parallel transport of
        the world-sheet orthogonal covector. Here 
 
 and  
.  
     

Note that the expression for this new SFF
 ^b_i   = n_i^G_   ^D__x^ = -  _x^ ^D_( G_  n_i^)    ,   sff 
differs from the previous one sff2  by the term containing the covariant
derivative of the metric. So, in the spaces with nonmetricity, there are two
forms of SFF, connected by the relation
 ^b_i   =  ^b _i   +
 ^Q_  _x^n^_i _x^   .
c) Parallel transport of the world-sheet vectors.  In the similar
procedure for the vectors  and , the orthogonal
projection of the   produce 
 and the world-sheet projection of 
 produce .

In analogy with the previous result, we define the bar induced connection
through the relation
v_+ ^  v_= _x^(+ d )
G_ (+ d )  ^V^_     ,  ptdb 
where
 ^  v_= ^ ^_  v_d ^  .  ptvb 
Then, we have
 ^ _,   =  _x^ ^D_( G_  _x^) =  ^_,  
-  ^Q_  _x^_x^_x^   ,
which relates the two forms of the induced connections up to the nonmetricity
term.

So, the induced connection and the SFF are projections, of the space-time
covariant derivative of , to the world-sheet and its
normal, respectively. Consequently, we have the generalization of the
Gauss-Weingarten equation
 ^ D__x^=  ^^_ 
_x^+  ^b^i_   n_i^  ,   scdd 
and
 ^ D_( G_  _x^) =
( ^ ^_  _x^+  ^b ^i_   n_i^)  G_          .   scddb 
There are also two forms of the world-sheet induced covariant derivatives,
corresponding to two forms of the world-sheet connections
 ^_v_= _v_-  ^^_  v_ ,   ^ _v_= _v_-  ^ ^_  v_   .
They are related by the expression
 ^ _v_=  ^_v_+  ^Q_  v^= G_   ^_v^   .
From this point we will use the variables without bar, because the
bar variables can be expressed in terms of the first ones and
nonmetricity.

Decomposition of the induced connection 
and of the SFF   

In analogy with the general rule for connection decomposition, we
can decompose the induced connection and SFF. With the help of
cde  we have
 ^D__x^= D__x^+ (  ^K^ _  + 1 2   ^Q^   _  )  _x^_x^   . dscd 
The world-sheet projection of the last equation, produces the
decomposition of the induced connection
 ^_,  = _,  +  ^K_  +
1 2   ^Q_        ,     cdews 
in terms of induced Christoffel connection, induced torsion  and
induced nonmetricity 
^_  = G^  _x^ G_ 
 ^ D__x^  , ich 
 ^T_  = ^T_  _x^_x^_x^=  ^_,   -
 ^_,       ,   it 
 ^Q_  = ^Q_  _x^_x^_x^= -  ^_G_         ,  inm 
where 
 is
the induced contortion. Note that both the torsion and
nonmetricity are tensors, so that the corresponding relations do not have
non-homogeneous terms.

The orthogonal projection of dscd  produces the decomposition
of the SFF
 ^b_i   = b_i   +  ^ K_i  
+ 1 2   ^ Q_i   b_i   +  ^ K b _i  
+ 1 2   ^ Q b _i      ,
where we used the notation
b_i   = n_i^G_   D__x^   ,   sffCh 
 ^ T b _i   =
 ^T_  n_i^_x^_x^ ^T_i         ,
 ^ Q b _i   =
 ^ Q_  n_i^_x^_x^ ^ Q_i         ,
and similarly as before 
.

Consequently, with the help of scdd  we have
D__x^=  ^_  _x^+
 b^i_  n_i^   ,
 ^T^ _  _x^_x^ ^T^ _  =
 ^T^ _  _x^+
 ^ T^i_  n_i^   ,
 ^ Q^ _  _x^_x^ ^ Q^ _  =
 ^Q^ _  _x^+
 ^ Q^i_  n_i^  .
When the torsion is present, the SFF is not symmetric in
 indices. Similarly as in the case of the
connection, we can write
 ^b_i   =  ^b_i ( )  +
1 2   ^T_i     ,   ^b_i ()  = b_i   +  ^K_i ()  + 1 2   ^Q_ i       .
Relations between space-time and world-sheet covariant derivatives 

Starting with the definition of the space-time covariant derivatives
along world-sheet direction
 ^D V^= V^( + d ) - V^_     ,
 dcd 
we can obtain its world-sheet and orthogonal projections,
multiplying dcd  with 
and , respectively
_x^G_   ^ D_V^=
 ^ _v_- v^i   ^ b _i      ,   n_i^G_   ^D_V^=
 ^ _v_i + v^  ^b_i       .
With the help of the relation 
 we obtain
 ^D_V^=  ^_v^ _x^+
n_i^  ^b^i_  v^+ n_i^G^i j    ^ _v_j - _x^v^i G^   ^ b _i      .  rcdu 
Similarly, for the covectors we have
 ^D_V_= G_  [ G^  _x^ ^_v_+
n_i^  ^b ^i_  v^]
+ G_  [G^i j  n_i^ ^_v_j -
G^  _x^v^i   ^b_i   ]    .   rcdd 
For the world-sheet tangent vectors, the last two equations
produce
 ^D_V^_=  ^_v^ _x^+
n_i^  ^b^i_  v^  ,   Ge 
 ^D_V_^= G_  [ G^ 
_x^  ^_v_+
n_i^  ^b ^i_  v^]     .  Ged 
We will also need the relation
( ^D_V_) _x^=  ^_v_- v^i   ^b_i     ,  rcd 
obtaining multiplying rcdd  by .

Mean extrinsic curvature 

In the torsion free case, the SFF is symmetric in the world-sheet indices and
its properties are well known in the literature. Here, we will consider the
case when nontrivial torsion and nonmetricity are present.

As usual, a curve is parametrized by its length parameter , so that the
unit tangent vector is . If the curve lies in the
world-sheet, we have , with 
. Let us denote by , the 2-plane spanned by the
tangent vector  and the unit world-sheet normal  . Then, 
 is the -th normal section of the world-sheet
. The curvature of the normal section , as a space-time curve,
is defined as the orthogonal projection of 
 ^k_i =  ^D_s t^G_  n^_i    ,
where , is  the
covariant derivative along the curve. It produces the following expression
 ^k_i =  ^b_i   t^t^=
 ^b_i ()  t^t^=   ^b_i ()  d ^d ^G_  d ^d ^    .       cns 
The curvature  depends on the direction of the tangent vector 
 and only on the symmetric part of the SFF. Let us stress, that in
the presence of nonmetricity,  is not orthogonal to the
tangent vector , and we additionally performed orthogonal projection.

In Euclidean torsion free spaces, the maximal and minimal values of 
 are the principal curvatures. The corresponding directions, defined by
, are the principal directions. The principal curvatures are
eigenvalues of the SFF and corresponding eigenvectors define the principal
directions.

In our case, the curvature ,  cns , is divergent in the
light-cone directions. Consequently, the extremely values do not exist. Still,
we can obtain the necessary information from the eigenvalue problem
( ^ b^i_  -   ^ ^i G_ ) v^= 0     .           ssp 
The eigenvalues of the quadratic forms  with
respect to the metric , we define as a principal
curvatures in Minkowski space-time. They are the solutions of the condition
, or explicitly
 ^ ^i_0,1  =   ^ H^i  ( ^ H^i)^2 -   ^
K^i      .
Here
 ^ H^i = 1 2  G^   ^ b^i_  
 =  1 2  ( ^ ^i_0 +  ^ ^i_1)     ,  aec 
is the trace of the SFF and 
 (no
summation over ) is Gauss curvature.

In order to simplify the relation cns , we will go to the new frame in
which both symmetric matrices,  and 
, are diagonal. We can choose the eigenvectors
(, ) of the symmetric part of the SFF 
, as new basis vectors. Then, instead of ssp  we have

, which produces 
. For 
, the eigenvectors are orthogonal. Let us chose 
to be time-like vector and  to be space-like vector, and normalize them
as . In the basis (), both the metric
and the symmetric part of the SFF, obtain diagonal forms
 G = 1  & 0            0    & -1          , b_i =  ^ ^i_0    & 0            0    &  -  ^ ^i_1            .
The curvature of the line  becomes
 ^k^i_tl  () =  ^ ^i_0 ^2()
-  ^ ^i_1 ^2 ()     ,
where  parametrize all time-like directions of
the tangent vectors. Similarly, for the space-like tangent vectors, we have
 ^k^i_sl  () =  ^ ^i_0 ^2()
-  ^ ^i_1 ^2 ()     .
The -th MEC usually is defined as a mean value of the -th normal
section, if we fixed the normal  and rotate the tangent vector
. In Euclidean spaces, the  and  functions appear instead
of  and , so that the mean value is well defined. In Minkowski
spaces, the curvature cns  is divergent in the light-like directions. We
introduce the cut-off , and define regularized mean curvature for the
time-like region
 ^H^i_tl  () = 1 2   _-
 ^ ^k^i_tl  () d    ,
and similarly for the space-like one. Finally, the mean
extrinsic curvature  we define as a mean value of the time-like
mean curvature with sign , and space-like mean curvature with sign
, with the same cut-off  going to the infinity.
We obtain
 _  1 2  [ ^H^i_tl 
()-  ^H^i_sl  ()] =
1 2  ( ^ ^i_0 +  ^ ^i_1) =  ^ H^i       ,  aec1 
which is just the expression aec , because the  dependence
disappears.

For 
, all linear combinations of the vectors  and  are
eigenvectors. We can choose some orthonormal basis, in which
G = 1  & 0            0    & -1          , b_i =  ^ ^i    & 0            0    &  -  ^ ^i           .
Then the line curvature does not depend on the tangent vector direction
 
Consequently, the MEC has the same interpretation

.

The surface defined by the equation  is
minimal surface . The name stems from the fact that in the Riemann
space-time the equation  define the surface of minimal area
, for the fixed boundary. In fact, for this
surface the first variation of the area vanishes
P_2 = -2  d^2 -G_    H^i n^_i G_   x^= 0    .
Dual mean extrinsic curvature, extrinsic mean torsion and C-duality 

Let us stress that above consideration is torsion independent, because the
antisymmetric part of the SFF disappears from  cns  and  aec . We are
going to include the torsion contribution and generalize the above results.

Let us first generalize the eigenvalue problem, and then offer its geometrical
interpretation. We introduce the dual eigenvalue   problem, such that
linear transformation of the vector  with operator 
 is proportional to the two dimensional dual vector


 ^ b^i_   v^=  ^^i   ^v_    ,
or equivalently
(  ^ b^i_  -   ^^i  _  -G_2  ) v^= 0     .           asp 
It is similar to ssp , but for the completeness we also need the
eigenvalues of the quadratic forms 
 with respect to the antisymmetric tensor 
.

The solutions of the condition 
, have the form
 ^^i_0,1  =   ^H^i ( ^H^i)^2 +  ^
K^i      .
In analogy with the previous case, we will call them dual principal curvatures,
and the variable
 ^H^i = 1 2  ( ^^i_0 +  ^^i_1) =
1 2  G^   ^b^i_  =
1 2  ^  -G_2    ^ b^i_  =
1 4  ^  -G_2  
 ^ T^i_        ,          dmc 
the dual mean extrinsic curvature . Here 

 (no summation over ) is the
same Gauss curvature as before.

Let us now turn to the geometrical meaning of the DMEC. In the case when
 and  are world-sheet tangent vectors (Fif. 1) (note that
all geodesics , ,  and  still
could be space-time curves) we can rewrite  cod  in the form
 ^T^x^(D_2) - x^(D_1) 2 d P_12   =
^  4 -G_2  
 ^T^_  _x^_x^    .
Here, 
 is area of the
parallelogram, spanned by the vectors 
 and , and where 
. We can conclude that 
does not depend on the directions  and , and on the
lengths  and . So, we will call this variable the mean torsion .
Its world-sheet projection is induced mean torsion
 ^T_=  ^T^G_  _x^=
 ^  4 -G_2    ^T_       .
Its normal projection is the extrinsic mean torsion 
 ^T_i  =  ^T^G_  n_i^=
^  4 -G_2     ^T_i  
=   ^H_i     ,
which is exactly the same variable as DMEC, defined above in dmc .

We can formulate the dual eigenvalue problem   asp , as an ordinary
eigenvalue problem 
, if we introduce the dual SFF
 ^b^i_  = G_ 
^  -G_2      ^ b^i_    .
We define the C-duality  (C urvature duality), which maps SFF to
dual SFF, , and
interchanges the role played by the symmetric and the antisymmetric parts of
the SFF. Consequently, under C-duality MEC maps to DMEC, allowing the exchange
of the mean curvature and mean torsion.

The self-dual and self-antidual configurations
 ^H^i =  ^H^i        ,      sdr 
correspond to the following conditions on the SFF
(G^  ^  -G_2  )  ^ b^i_  = 0    .   sasd 
The equations  sdr  and sasd  define C-dual (antidual) surfaces .
In the torsion free case, they turn to the standard minimal surface condition,
.

The stringy geometry as a space-time perception by probe string 

We are going to investigate the dynamics of the string, propagated in the
curved space-time. From the mathematical point of view, the  string equations of
motion describe the embedding conditions of the world-sheet in the space-time.
We are particularly interested in the target space geometry properties,
recognized by the string. We will see, that the probe string feels more
space-time features (torsion and nonmetricity) then the probe particle.

The action and the canonical analysis results 

The action-S= _d^2 -g   [ 1 2 g^ G_ (x)
+^  -g    B_ (x)]
_x^_x^+ (x)  R ^(2)     ,   ac 
describes bosonic string propagation in -dependent background fields:
metric , antisymmetric tensor field  and
dilaton field . Here,  is the intrinsic world-sheet
metric and  is corresponding scalar curvature. In
App. A, we will introduce the intrinsic connection , as a Christoffel
connection for the intrinsic metric . So, we mark all
related variables with the sign , in order to distinguish them from the
corresponding induced ones.

In this paper we will restrict our consideration to such forms of the
dilaton fields , that its gradient 
, is not light-cone vector. So, the condition 
is fulfilled in the whole space-time.

The projection operator
P^T _  = G_  - a_a_a^2  = G_ - n_n_G_ ^D-1    ,   PT 
(, where  if
 is time like vector and  if  is space like
vector), can be interpreted as the induced metric on the  dimensional
submanifold .

Let us briefly review the result of the canonical analysis of ref..
It is useful to define the currents
J_  =P^T _ ^j_  +a_2
a^2 i_^= j_  - a_a^2  j   ,  J 
i_^F= a^a^2  j_ -1 2 a^2  i_^2 F^    , i_^_F 2  ,   2.8 
where
j_  =_+2_  x^ '   ,
_  B_  1 2 
G_    , jmi  and
j=a^j_  -1 2  i_^=a^2 (i_^F 2 F^)     .   j 
All  and  derivatives of the fields ,  and  can be
expressed in terms of the corresponding currents
x ^=  G^  2   (h^- J_-   - h^+ J_+  )   ,  xt 
F = 1 4   (h^- i_-^F - h^+ i_+^F)-1 2   (h^-+h^+)^   ,   = 1 4   (h^- i_-^- h^+ i_+^)    ,       Ft 
and
x^ = G^  2   (J_+   - J_-  )   , F^ = 1 4   (i_+^F - i_-^F)     ,  ^ = 1 4   (i_+^- i_-^)     .   prim 
Up to boundary term, the canonical Hamiltonian density has the standard form
H _c= h^- T_- + h^+ T_+       .  hc 
The energy momentum tensor components obtain new expressions
T_=1 4  (G^  J_  J_  + i_^F i_^)
+1 2  i_^  =
1 4  ( G^ 
j_  j_  -j^2 a^2  ) +i_   ,  emt 
where
i_1 2  (i_^ ' - F' i_^ )   .  2.16 
The same chirality energy-momentum tensor components satisfy two independent
copies of Virasoro algebras,
 T_, T_= -[ T_() +T_( ) ]  ^     ,   Vir 
while the opposite chirality components commute . The
energy-momentum tensor components  are generators of the two
dimensional diffeomorphisms. Their new, non-linear representation is the
consequence of the dilaton field presence.

Equations of motion 

In the paper, using canonical approach, we derived the following
equations of motion
[J^]    __x^+  ^_ ^_x^_x^=0    ,    lJ 
[h^]  G_   _x^_x^-2   __=0     ,  lh 
[i^F]    R ^(2)  + 2 a^2  (D_  a_) _x^_x^=0     ,     lF 
where the variables in the parenthesis denote the currents corresponding
to this equation. The expression
 ^^_ = ^_  +a^a^2  D_  a_= P^T   _^_  +
a^a^2  _a_= ^_  P^T   _B^_ 
+a^a^2  D_  a_  ,  cdc 
which appears in the  equation is a generalized connection, which
full geometrical interpretation will be presented later. Under space-time
general coordinate transformations the expression 
 transforms as a connection. In  lJ  and lF  we omit the
currents  indices, because  and 
 as a consequence of the symmetry relations 
 and 
.

We can derive the Lagrangian equations of motion, independently of the previous
consideration. Varying the action ac  with respect to , we obtain
[x^]  g^    __x^+ ^()   _ 
_x^_x^-a^ R ^(2)  = 0  
,   emx 
where
^()   _  = g^    ^_  -
^  -g   B^_     .  fie 
Because in the light-cone basis we have  and , the above expression has
only two nonzero components
^()   _  =  ^_     ,   ^()   _  = 0   .  lx 
So, the expression "two types of connections", which has been used in the literature, means
that in the light-cone basis there are just two nonzero elements of five
indices expression fie . The connections 
corresponds to the parallel transport along the light-cone lines
, respectively. Trough the paper we will preserve the word
connection, having in mind this comment.

Instead of the equations of motion with respect to the world-sheet metric
, we prefer to have ones with respect to the fields  and

[F]    =0  ,   emF 
T_=  2  (G_    _x^ _x^-2   _ _-     )=0    ,  lemh 
where the  are energy-momentum tensor components in the light-cone basis.

Let us compare these equations with ones obtained before, using canonical
methods. The equation  lh  follows from emF  and lemh . The
equation  emx  in the light-cone basic obtains the form
[x^_]   _ _x^+  _ ^ _x^ _x^-  1 2  a^ R ^(2)   =0     ,
because  and  as a
consequence of the above symmetry relations. Then we can conclude that 
and  contain longitudinal and transversal parts of 
respectively
[i^F] = - 1 a^2  ( a_[x^] + [F] )     , 2[J^] = P^T
  _[x^] + a^a^2  [F]      .
We prefer the equations of motion in the form lJ -lF , with the
canonical origin, because they are more
appropriate for geometrical interpretation.

Stringy torsion and nonmetricity 

Let us apply the general considerations of Sec. 2 to the string case. Instead
of general mark , the mark  will indicates the presence of
nonmetricity felt by the string, and lower indices   will indicate the
presence of the corresponding form of torsion felt by the string. Absence of
any sign will means that the connection is Christoffel.

The manifold , together with the affine connection 
 and the metric , define the affine
space-time . The connection cdc  we
will call stringy connection  and the corresponding space-time 
, observed by the string propagating in
the background ,  and , we will call stringy space-time . The classification of space-times dependence on the
background fields contributions, will be investigated in Sec. 4.

The antisymmetric part of the stringy connection is the stringy torsion 
 ^T_ ^_  = ^_ ^_  -  ^_ ^_  =
2 P^T   _B^_         .   T 
It is the transverse projection of the field strength of the antisymmetric
tensor field .

The presence of the dilaton field  leads to the breaking of the
space-time metric postulate. It means that the metric  is not
compatible with the stringy connection .
This fact can be expressed by the nontrivial stringy nonmetricity 
 ^Q_  - ^D_  G_  =
1 a^2  D_  (a_a_)          .   mp 
Consequently, during  stringy parallel transport, the lengths and angles
deformations depend on the vector field .

Note that ,  and 
are invariant under scale transformation of the dilaton field  by the constant .

The stringy Weyl vector
 ^Q_= 1 D  G^   ^Q_ = -4 D  _    ,     Wvs 
is a gradient of the new scalar field , defined by the expression
1 4  a^2 = -1 4  (G^  __)   .   sf 
It does not depend on the antisymmetric field  and consequently on the  indices.

The stringy angle preservation relation
 ^_  =  ^Q_  - G_   ^Q_=0            ,   aps 
is a condition on the dilaton field . Generally, in stringy geometry both
the lengths and the angles could be changed under the parallel transport.

Using the relation
 ^K_  + 1 2   ^Q_    =
1 2   ^T_  + 1 2   ^Q_        ,
instead cde , we can write
 ^_,  = _,  1 2   ^T_  +
1 2   ^Q_         ,     cde1 
where the quantities  and

 do not depend on  indices. In fact, the last term is 
, so that we can recognize our starting
expression cdc .

In the stringy geometry, covectors  are covariantly constant target space vectors
 ^D_  a_=0     .     cva 
By definition it means that , or that the
covector , after parallel transport from the point  to the point
 with the connection , is equal
to the local covector . So, covector field  is stringy teleparallel , because its parallel transport is path independent.
Note that as a consequence of nonmetricity, the above feature valid only for
covectors , and not for the vectors .

 Background fields contribution to the space-time geometry  

In this section we will make the classification of space-time, depending on
the presence of the background fields. We will analyze the field equations and
find their geometrical interpretations.

Riemann space-time induced by metric  

Let us start with the case where only nontrivial background field is the
metric tensor , while . Then, instead of
, the current takes the form 
, but with the same Lagrangian expression
. The
canonical Hamiltonian has the similar form as in hc 
H _c^G= h^- t_-^G + h^+ t_+^G      ,  2.141 
with following expression for the energy-momentum tensor
t^G_=1 4  G^  j_ ^G j_ ^G   .   emtG 
The absence of the dilaton field , leads to the conformal invariance of
the action. Consequently, the field  and the corresponding equation
 are absent. The first two equations of motion lJ  and lh 
survive in the simpler form
[j_G^]     __x^+ _ ^_x^_x^=0     ,  [h^]  G_   _x^_x^=0    ,
where  is the standard Christoffel
connection.

The world-sheet projection and orthogonal projection of the equation
,  obtain the forms
g^  (^_   - ^_  )=0     ,  ic 
and
g^  b^i_  = 0    .   imc 
Here,  is induced world-sheet Christoffel
connection ich  and  is corresponding SFF sffCh .

The  equation can be written in the form
G_  e_^e_^G_  = 0       , imtem 
where  is world-sheet
induced metric. Because in the light-cone frame, the intrinsic metric is off-diagonal,
, we have , or equivalently
G_  = g_            .  icc 
Multiplying the last equation with , we obtain the
expression , so that
. The last
relation connects the Polyakov and Nambu-Goto expressions for the string
action. We can rewrite icc  in the form
G_  -G   =  g_  -g     ,
so that, because of the conformal invariance, only the metric densities are related.

From icc  we obtain relation between intrinsic connection
 and induced one 
^_   = _ ^-^__-
^__+ g_   g^  _  ,
(_1 2  _)   cc 
which is also a solution of ic . Therefore, both intrinsic world-sheet
metric tensor and intrinsic connection, are equal to the induced ones from the
space-time up to the conformal factor . This is expected result,
because of the conformal invariance of the action. The complete equality of
the metric tensors and connections is just the choice of the gauge fixing
.

With the help of  icc  equation imc  becomes
H^i 1 2 G^  b^i_  = 0   .
Therefore, all MECs, corresponding to the normal vectors , are equal
to zero. In the geometrical language the  world-sheet  is minimal
surface . From starting  equations of motion, two define intrinsic
connection in terms of the induced one and  define the MEC.

The string with the background field  does not  see the torsion
and nonmetricity. It feels the target space as Riemann space-time  of
general relativity.

Stringy Riemann-Cartan space-time induced by metric
 and antisymmetric tensor   

In the next step, we include antisymmetric background field , but
still keep  . Now, the relevant current  is already
defined by expression jmi , with the same form of Hamiltonian  hc  and
with the energy-momentum tensor
t_=1 4  G^  j_  j_     .   emt0 
With the same reason as in the previous subsection, we have again two equations of motion
[j^]     __x^+ _ ^_x^_x^=0       , [h^] G_   _x^_x^=0    .  emjh 
Now, two forms of connection
^_ = ^_  B^_       ,  gco 
and corresponding two forms of covariant derivative , appear. The
new term in the connection is the field strength of the antisymmetric tensor,
defined in fsB . Note that  and  always appear
in the combination 
, so that the generalized connection gco  can be expressed as in
coP .

The torsion
T_ ^_  = _ ^_  - _ ^_  =
2 B^ _    ,           Tor 
is the field strength for the antisymmetric tensor. In this case the
contortion is proportional to the torsion 
.

As well as in the case of Riemann space-time, the same relations between
metric tensors icc  and between the connections cc , follow from the
 equation  emjh .

We can rewrite the  equation in the form
g^  ( D__x^- ^_  _x^) =  ^  -g  B^_     .
Its world-sheet projection produce
g^  (^_  - ^_  )
= -  ^  -g  B^_       ,   cei 
where  is the world-sheet torsion, induced from the target
space. Because it is totally antisymmetric, in two dimensions it vanishes,
. So, we obtain the same equation  ic , as
in the case of Riemann space-time.

The orthogonal projection of the  equation takes the form
g^  b_i   =   ^  -g   B_i     ,   dem 
or equivalently
(g^   ^  -g  )
b_i   = 0    .   dem1 
We used two forms of SFF 
, which are connected
. So, dem1  contains
only one independent equation of motion.

Again, both two dimensional intrinsic metric tensor and two dimensional
intrinsic connection, up to the conformal factor, are induced from the target
space. So, we can rewrite the above equation in terms of induced metric
( G^   ^  -G_2  ) b_i   = 0   ,  H_i  ^H_i  =0           . sdrc 
There is unique MEC  and two types of DMECs ,
satisfying the relation . So, the
equations sdrc  with upper and lower indices are equal. In this language
equation of motion means that MEC is equal to DMEC, or that world-sheet
 is C-dual (antidual) surface .

Consequently, the string with background fields  and 
 feels the target space as Riemann-Cartan  space-time 
. Note that the world-sheet is torsion free while the space-time
is not.

Stringy torsion free space-time induced by background fields  and  

Let us consider the case when the fields  and  are present,
 while  is absent. The equations of motion lJ -lF  obtain
the form
[J^]     __x^+  ^_ ^_x^_x^=0    ,    lJgf 
[h^]  G_   _x^_x^-2   __=0     ,  lhgf 
[i^F]    R ^(2)  + 2 a^2  (D_a_) _x^_x^= 0     ,     lFgf 
and can be rewritten as
[J^]   g^  (   __x^+
 ^_ ^_x^_x^) =0    ,    lJgf1 
[h^]  G_  - 2   _a_= 0     ,  lhgf1 
[i^F]    R ^(2)  + g^  a^2  (D_a_) _x^= 0     .     lFgf1 
The connection
 ^^_  = ^_  + a^a^2  D_a_  ,  ctf 
obtains the new term, which is the origin of the nonmetricity
 ^Q_   - ^D_G_  =
1 a^2  D_(a_a_)          ,   mptf 
while the torsion is zero.

Let us find the induced connection and the SFF, for this case. With the help
of ctf  we have
 ^D__x^= D__x^+ a^a^2  (D_a_) _x^   .
The world-sheet projection produce the induced connection
 ^^_  = ^_  + a^a^2  (D_a_) _x^   ,   stfco 
and the normal projection produce the SFF
 ^b^i_  = b^i_  +
a^i a^2  (D_a_) _x^   .
Now, we are going to derive the useful relation between the space-time and the
world-sheet covariant derivatives, which we will frequently use later.

Substituting mark , with mark  in rcd  and separating
 dependent terms, we obtain
_v_= ( D_V_-  a^V_^a^2  D_a_)
_x^+ v^i   ^b_i      .  cv 
Here,  is the component of the covector  orthogonal to the
world-sheet. For  we have
1 a^2  (D_a_) _x^= 1 a_2^2 
_a_- a^i a_2^2   ^b_i      ,   pcd 
where  is a length of the world-sheet projection of the
vector field . We also used the relation .

With the help of  pcd , the stringy torsion free connection
stfco  becomes
 ^^_  = ^_  + a^a_2^2  _a_-  a^a^i a_2^2   ^b_i      . sic 
The stringy torsion free world-sheet covariant derivative is
 ^_v_= _v_- (av)_2
a_2^2  (_a_- a^i  ^b_i  )    ,   scd 
and for , it produces
 ^_a_= a^i   ^b_i        . scda 
Let us turn to the equations of motion. The world-sheet and orthogonal
projections of  equation are
g^  ( ^^_  -
^_ ) =0   ,   g^  (   _v_-
 ^_v_)= 0     ,  fsJ 
g^    ^b_i   = 0     .   ssJ 
The last equation, together with scda  produce 
, and with the help of
second equation fsJ  we obtain .

We will preserve the condition , or equivalently 
, because the light-cone line must be the
same in terms of the intrinsic and induced metrics. Then, the new term in
 equation vanishes , which
complete the above condition
  _a_= 0     .  vca 
As well as in the previous two cases, from the relation 
 follows the equalities of the intrinsic and induced
metric densities. The relation between corresponding connections changes in
the presence of the nonmetricity
 ^Q_  = ( ^- )_,  
+ ( ^- )_,   -
2 _G_    .  (_1 2  _)       inml 
From sic  and vca  we have 
 and consequently
 ^Q_  a^a^= -2 a^i a^ ^b_i   - 2 a_2^2 _  .  inm1 
On the other hand, from mptf , inm  and pcd  we obtain
 ^Q_  = 1 a_2^2  _(
a_a_) - a^i a_2^2 ( a_ ^b_i   +
 a_ ^b_i  )      ,  wsinm 
and
 ^Q_  a^a^=
_a_2^2 -2 a^i a^ ^b_i           .  inm2 
Subtracting inm1  from inm2 ,  we obtain the equation for 
, . Its
solution is easily to be found, . Therefore, when
the dilaton field  is present, the theory lose conformal invariance and
the coefficient  is determined. In our case, we have relation between
intrinsic and induced metric tensors
g_  = a_2^2 G_      ,   gg 
and between intrinsic and induced connections
^_  =  ^^_  - _^_- _^_+ G_  G^ 
_- 1 2   ^Q^   _     .    ( _-_ a_2^2  )
With the help of pcd  and ssJ , from the equation
 we obtain the expression for the intrinsic world-sheet curvature
 R ^(2)  = - G^  a_2^4 
_a_    .  iwsc 
Let us find its relation with the induced one. Both curvatures we can
relate with the hat curvature 
-g    R ^(2)  = - g  ( R 
+ 2   F)   , -G_2   R^(2)  = - g  ( R 
+ 2   F_G )   ,
where in agreement with  g  we use light-cone variables for
both intrinsic and induced metrics 
. Eliminating 
and using gg  (which is equivalent to the relation
) we have
R^(2) =  a_2^2   R ^(2)  - a_2^2      , tdcr 
where  is Laplace operator for the induced metric
. So, in our case
with the help of  iwsc  we have
R^(2) =  1 a_2^4  - a_2^2      .   itdc 
The equation ssJ  with the help of gg  takes the form
 ^H_i  = 1 2  G^    ^b_i   = 0  
.    stfe 
Consequently, all stringy MECs, , vanish and the world-sheet is
stringy minimal surface .

Therefore, the string with background fields  and  can see
the space-time nonmetricity. The corresponding target space we call stringy torsion free space-time .

Stringy space-time induced by background fields ,  and  

Finally, in the last step we include the dilaton field , so that all
three background fields are present.

The equations of motion are the complete ones, lJ -lF , with two forms
of connections cdc . The string feel both torsion and nonmetricity defined
by the expressions T  and mp  respectively. Separating the 
dependence, we can rewrite the field equations in the form
[J^]   g^  ( ^D__x^- ^_  _x^) -
^  -g   P^T    _B^ _   = 0       ,    lJs 
[h^]  G_  - 2   _a_= 0     ,  lhs 
[i^F]    R ^(2)  + g^  a^2  (D_a_) _x^+ ^  -g   a^2  a_B^ _   = 0        .     lFs 
We will follow the considerations of the previous two cases. First, we find
the consequences of the relation rcd  substituting mark  with
marks  and separating the  dependent terms. The
contribution of the  term disappears and we
obtain the same relations cv  and pcd .

The stringy connection and stringy world-sheet covariant derivatives are
 ^^_  =  ^^_ 
B^T   _      ,  ^_  v_=  ^_  v_B^T   _  v_   ,
where  and 
 are defined in sic  and scd , so that scda 
still valid because  disappears.

The stringy world-sheet induced nonmetricity has a form
 ^Q_  =  ^Q_ (B^L_  + B^L_ )        ,   wsinmpm 
where  has been introduced in wsinm ,
and 
 is a world-sheet projection of the longitudinal part
of the field strength .

The world-sheet and the normal projections of the  equation are
g^  ( ^^_  -
^_ ) = ^  -g  
B^T    _   = 2 -G_2  -g      ^T^_  ,       fsBJ 
g^    ^b_i   =  ^  -g  
B^T  _i     ,  ( g^   ^  -g   )  ^b_i   = 0       .   ssBJ 
Using scda , fsBJ  and ssBJ  we obtain
g^    _a_=
^  -g   (a^i B^T  _i  + a^B^T  _ ) = ^  -g    a^B^T  _  = 0       .  vca1 
This is the same result as in the torsion free case,
.

For the same reason as in the previous case, we will preserve the condition
, which is equivalent to the relation 
. Together with the  equation it gives
, and finally the same equation
vca , .

The relation between the connections is similar to inml 
 ^Q_  = ( ^_- )_,  
+ ( ^_- )_,   -
2 _G_    ,  (_1 2  _)       inmls 
but now we have 

, so that
 ^Q_  a^a^= -2 a^i a^ ^b_i   - 2 a_2^2 _2 B^T_   a^a^  .  inms1 
The equation wsinmpm  produce
 ^Q_  a^a^=
_a_2^2 -2 a^i a^ ^b_i   2 B^L_   a^a^  .  inms2 
Since
B^T_  + B^L_  = B_ = 0     ,   TL 
because it is totally antisymmetric two-dimensional tensor, we have the same
equation for  with the same solution gg .

With the help of pcd  and ssBJ  the  equation becomes
 R ^(2)  = - G^  a_2^4  _a_+ ^  -g  
( a^i a_2^2  B^T_i   - a^a^2  B^T_  )    .    iwscs 
Using the properties 
 and TL , we again have
iwsc . Consequently, from tdcr  we obtain itdc , as well as in the
torsion free case.

The equation of motion ssBJ  with the help of gg  takes the form
( G^   ^  -G_2   )  ^b_i   = 0     ,
 ^H_i  ^H_ i  = 0      .         ssde 
So, the world-sheet  is stringy C-dual (antidual) surface . For
 it turns to  sdrc   and for 
 to stfe .

The string propagating in the presence of all three background fields 
,  and , feels both space-time torsion and
nonmetricity. The corresponding target space we call stringy space-time .

There are some other possibilities which we will not consider here. For
example, the presence of  field only, will lead to the flat
space-time with torsion, which is known as teleparallel  space-time.

The space-time measure 

Using the stringy geometry considered in the previous sections, let us try to
discuss possible forms of the space-time actions. Generally it has the form
 ^S = d^D x   ^  ^L      ,  sta 
where  is a measure factor, and  is a
Lagrangian, which depends on the space-time field strengths.

We are going to find invariant measure, which means that:

1. it is invariant under space-time general coordinate transformations;

2. it is preserved under parallel transport;

3. it enable integration by parts.

The second requirement is equivalent to the condition .
The third one, is consequence of the Leibniz rule, and the relation
d^D x   ^  ^D_  V^= d^D x _( ^V^)     ,  ibp 
so that we are able to use Stoke's theorem.

For Riemann and Riemann-Cartan space-times, the solution for the measure factor
is well known  . For spaces with
nonmetricity, this standard measure is not preserved under the stringy
parallel transport, and requirements 2. and 3. are not satisfy. Instead to
change the connection and find volume-preserving one, as has been done in ref.
, we prefer to change the measure. Let us try to find the the
stingy measure in the form . In order
to be preserved under the parallel transport with the stingy connection, it must
satisfy the condition
 ^D_  ( -G  ) = _( -G  ) -
 ^^_  -G  = 0         .
Using the relation
 ^^_  = _( - G  e^-2  ) =
^_  + D 2   ^Q_  ,  Grr 
we find the equation for ,  
. The fact that the stringy Weyl vector
 is a gradient of the scalar field , defined in
sf , help us to solve this equation obtaining .
The stringy measure factor, preserved under parallel transport
with the connection , obtains the form
 ^= -G  e^-2            .
Note that now we have 
, and consequently ibp  is satisfied. So, we can use the
integration by parts for stringy derivatives , if we use
the stringy measure . Therefore, all requirements are
satisfy.

Let us shortly compare the action sta  with the space-time action of the
papers . In spite of their different origin there are some
interesting similarities. The Lagrangians from these papers are scheme
dependent (see), and can be reproduced with suitable combinations of
our invariants: the stringy scalar curvature, stringy torsion and stringy
nonmetricity.

We are particularly interested to compare the integration measures. The
measure factor of the papers, , has the
same form as our one and confirm the existence of some space-time
nonmetricity. The requirement of the full measures equality, ,
leads to to the Liouville like equation for the dilaton field
G^  __- e^-4   = 0      .  lle 
For  it turns to the real Liouville equation.

Note that there are some considerable differences between these approaches.
Their result has been obtained in the leading order perturbation theory in
powers of the curvature, while our result is non perturbative. Their result is
a consequence of quantum one loop computation, while our result is classical.

Conclusions 

In this paper, we considered classical theory of the bosonic string
propagating in the nontrivial background. In particular, we are interested in
the space-time geometry felt by the string.

In Sec 2, we investigated geometry of the surface embedded into space-time
with torsion and nonmetricity. The breaking of space-time metric postulate
produces two forms of SFF,  sff  and
  sff2 , and consequently, two forms
of MEC, whose difference is proportional to nonmetricity. We cleared the
meaning of MEC in Minkowski space-time  (see aec  and
aec1 ), and introduced the concept of DMEC  dmc  as
orthogonal projection of the mean torsion. In order to find geometrical
interpretation for the field equations, we defined C-duality which maps MEC to
DMEC. The torsion changes the equation of embedded surfaces. Instead of the
usual minimal surface , we introduced C-dual (antidual)
surface defined by the self-duality (self-antiduality) conditions, 
.

Then we considered the equations of motion lJ -lF , which have been
derived in ref. using Hamiltonian approach, and independently in
Sec. 3 using Lagrangian approach. With the help of the general decomposition
of the space-time connection, we have concluded that the stringy space-time
has nontrivial torsion and nonmetricity, originating from the antisymmetric
field  and dilaton fields . We obtained their explicit
expressions T  and mp .

In sec. 4, we clarified the space-time geometry dependence on the background fields. In the
presence of the metric tensor , the space-time is of the Riemann type, while the
world-sheet is a minimal surface. The inclusion of the target space antisymmetric field 
 produces Riemann-Cartan space-time and the world-sheet becomes C-dual surface sdrc . In
both cases the intrinsic metric and connection are equal to the induced ones, up to conformal
transformation.

The appearance of the dilaton field  broke the compatibility between the
space-time metric tensor and stringy connection. It also broke conformal
invariance, introducing new component of the intrinsic metric tensor , and
consequently, the new equation of motion . This new field equation
allows us to calculate the induced world-sheet curvature itdc  as a
function of the dilaton field.

When all three background fields ,  and  are
present, the string feels the complete stringy space-time and the world-sheet
becomes stringy C-dual surface ssde . The theory looses conformal
invariance, and the relation between the intrinsic and induced variables is
fixed gg . The corresponding factor is the length of the world-sheet
projection of the gradient of the dilaton field.

In Sec. 5, we constructed the integration measure for the theories with
nonmetricity. In fact, the stringy Weyl vector is a gradient of the scalar
field , necessary to make the integration measure invariant under
parallel transport. We discussed the connection between our measure and that
of the papers , in spite of their quite different origin.
Their result is quantum and perturbative while our is classical but non
perturbative. In particular, our scalar field , defined in sf ,
is different from their , but has the same position in the expression
for the measure. These two measures are equal for , which is
the condition on the dilaton field  in the form of the Liouville like
equation lle .



World-sheet geometry 

It is useful to parameterize the intrinsic world-sheet metric tensor
, with the light-cone variables   (see the
papers)
g_  =e^2F  g _ =
1 2 e^2F  -2h^-h^+    &  h^-+h^+            h^-+h^+    &  -2         .               g 
The world-sheet interval
ds^2 = g_  d ^d ^= 2 d ^+ d
^-     ,
can be expressed in terms of the variables
d ^=  1 2   e^F ( d ^1 - h^d ^0)
= e^F d  ^= e^ _d ^    .
The quantities  define the light-cone one form basis,
, and its inverse define the tangent
vector basis, . We will
use the relations
^ab  e_a ^e_b ^= e_+ ^e_- ^+
e_- ^e_+ ^= g^    , ^ab  e_a ^e_b ^= e_+ ^e_- ^- e_- ^e_+ ^= ^  -g     , mtast 
where .

In the tangent basis notation, the components of the arbitrary vector
 have the form
V_ =e^-F  V _=e_  ^V_=
2  e^-F  h^- -h^+  (V_0+h^ V_1)  .     vec 
In this notation, the Laplace operator becomes 
 where 
. We also use the relation
-g    R ^(2)  =-g  (R ^(2)  +2  F)    .        RR 
Space-time geometry and world-sheet as embedded surface 

In this appendix, we introduce some notations and define the properties of 
dimensional space time . We also present space-time and world sheet
classification, which depends on the background fields.

 In the affine  space-time, 
, the linear connection
 ^_,  = _,  +  ^K_  +
1 2   ^Q_         ,     cdea 
can be expressed in terms of Christoffel one, contortion and nonmetricity. The
Christoffel  connection
^_ =1 2  G^ (_G_ 
+ _G_ - _G_ )     ,        coG 
depends only on the space time metric tensor . The contortion is
a function of the torsion
 ^K_  = 1 2   ^T_     =
1 2  ( ^T_  +  ^T_  -  ^T_ )      ,  Ka 
which itself is defined as
 ^T^_  = ^^_  -  ^^_ 
  .
The nonmetricity tensor is
 ^Q_ =-  ^D_G_     .  nma

        [Example]Classification of space-time.   is affine space-time ,
         is stringy space-time , S is stringy torsion free space-time ,
         is stringy Riemann-Cartan space-time and   is Riemann space-time.  
     

All covariant derivatives are defined in the standard way
 ^D_  V_  = _V_  -  ^^_   V_     ,   ^D_   V^  = _V^  +  ^^_   V^    . cd 
The world-sheet is affine C-dual (antidual) surface 
 ^H^i =  ^H^i      ( G^  ^  -G_2   )  ^ b^i_  = 0        .  sdra 
 In the Riemann  space-time, 
, the torsion and nonmetricity vanish 
, , and the connection is just the
Christoffel one .

The world-sheet is minimal surface 
H^i 1 2 G^  b^i_  = 0   .
 In the stringy Riemann-Cartan  space-time, 
, there are two types of the torsion
 ^T^_   T^_ =
2 B^_        ,
where the new term is the field strength of the antisymmetric tensor
B_ = _B_  + _B_  + _B_ =
D_B_  + D_B_  + D_B_      .       fsB 
Consequently, there are two types of the connection
 ^^_  ^_ = ^_  B^_       ,  coB 
which can be expressed in terms of the variables 

_,  = 1 2  (_G_ 
+_G_ -_G_ )   ,       coP 
in the similar way as  can be expressed in terms of
. The nonmetricity in the stringy Riemann-Cartan space-time
vanishes, .

The world-sheet is C-dual (antidual) surface 
H_i =  ^H_i    ,  ( G^   ^  -G_2   )
b_i   = 0      .   sdrca 
 In the stringy torsion free  space-time, S
, the torsion vanishes 
, while the nonmetricity and connection obtain the forms
 ^Q_     ^Q_   - ^D_G_  =
1 a^2  D_(a_a_)          ,   mptfa 
and
 ^^_    ^^_  = ^_  +a^a^2  D_a_  .  ctfa 
The world-sheet is stringy minimal surface 
 ^H_i  1 2  G^    ^b_i   = 0     .    stfea 
 Finally, in the stringy  space-time, 
, both the torsion and the nonmetricity survive
in the following forms
 ^T^_    ^T_ ^_   =
2 P^T   _B^_  = 2 G^(D-1)   _B^_           ,   Ta 
 ^Q_    ^Q_  - ^D_  G_  =
1 a^2  D_  (a_a_)          ,   mpa 
with the contribution of all three background fields , 
 and . The stringy connection
 ^^_    ^^_ = ^_  +a^a^2 
D_  a_= P^T   _^_  +
a^a^2  _a_  ,     coFi 
has the following symmetry
 ^^_  =  ^^_       .   sp 
Covariant derivatives of the vector field , have a properties 
 and .

The world-sheet is stringy C-dual (antidual) surface 
 ^H_i =  ^H_i    , ( G^   ^  -G_2   )  ^b_i   = 0     .            ssdea
