  A method for systematically including topological degrees of freedom
  in perturbation theory is developed. This is not bound by the
  restrictions of semi-classical techniques. The Yang-Mills theory in
  three Euclidean dimensions is considered here. 
  A well-defined separation of the topological and the "spin
  wave" degrees of freedom is obtained, motivated by a singular gauge. This
  has "photons" distorting the spherically symmetric magnetic fields
  of Dirac monopoles, and massless charged vector bosons ""
  scattering off the latter. It is explicitly shown that the Dirac
  string does not contribute. The mode of the charged vector bosons
  with total angular momentum  provides precisely the core to
  give a finite energy to the monopole. The radial equation for 
  is remarkably simplified and only two polarization states survive
  exactly for the anomalous magnetic moment required by the Yang-Mills
  interaction.

Introduction 


It is expected that the topological degrees of freedom such as
monopoles, instantons, -vortices etc. are responsible for crucial
properties such as confinement, deconfinement phase transition,
 mass difference etc. An example is provided by the
Georgi-Glashow model in  dimensions. Classically the system may
be in the Higgs phase, but the topological degrees of freedom restore
confinement. A clean demonstration of this is possible
because there is a regime of parameters where semiclassical techniques
and the dilute gas approximation can be strictly justified.  This uses
the finite-energy, classically stable 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole
solution of the Euclidean theory. We have considered this example to
highlight the differences with the case of the  dimensional
Yang-Mills theory which we address in this paper. In three Euclidean
dimensions, the theory does not have classically stable monopole
solutions.  Nevertheless, consider the 't Hooft-Polyakov ansatz
 for the non-Abelian gauge potential : 
A_i^a(x) = _iab  x^b 1-K(r) r^2  

where 
labels the space index and  label the group indices.  Here
. As long as  as  and
 as , this configuration has a
finite (Euclidean) action. Moreover it has strong qualitative effects.
Consider a large Wilson loop
W [C] = P (i _C dx^i A_i^a(x) ^a/2)
(where  stands for the path ordering along the loop , and
 are the Pauli matrices). This configuration gives 
 where  is the solid angle subtended by the
loop at the origin. Such configurations have the potential to disorder
and change the expectation value of  from the perimeter law to
the area law. The reason is that for a monopole near the plane of the
loop,  and , so that a gas of
(anti-)monopoles can give coherent cancellations and area law.  A
suggestive calculation comes from the vortices in two (Euclidean)
dimensional Abelian Higgs model. In the dilute gas
approximation, with the (anti-)vortex having a chemical potential
, we get
W[C] _n=0 ^  (-1)^n A^n n!  (e^-  )^n 
= (-e^- A).
(Here we have summed over vortices only, though anti-vortices are to
be included in an analogous manner.)  is the area of the loop.The
entropy factor  is there because each vortex can be located
anywhere inside the loop, and  is the symmetry factor. As
each vortex contributes , we get the alternating sign factor
. Because of the coherent cancellation,  is much smaller
(follows area law) than what perturbative calculation would suggest.

Similar arguments are in operation in the three-dimensional
Georgi-Glashow model.  We may expect an analogous mechanism to be
responsible for confinement in the Yang-Mills theory in three
Euclidean dimensions too. 
Configurations  such as in () have finite action, and 
should be included in the sum over configurations,
Z = D    (-1 2e^2  d^3x ^2(x) )
where 
 is the non-Abelian magnetic field.  But the
conventional semiclassical techniques are not applicable as there is 
no stable classical monopole solution. Indeed, the
situation is more demanding.



The form factor  in Eq. () is actually a function
of  where  is the length scale associated with the monopole. 
Then the action must be proportional to  due to dimensional reasons.
(This is the reason for the classical instability of
this configuration: the action is reduced as the monopole expands.) As
a consequence, monopoles of very large size are very light, and
therefore can proliferate. The situation is exactly the opposite of
one where the dilute gas approximation can be justified.  We need a way
to handle large, light and overlapping monopole configurations. In
Ref. it was proposed to do this by summing over the
"topological centres" of monopoles with a constraint related to the
size of the monopole. The semiclassical technique can be modified in
principle to carry out this computation. But explicit computations are
technically difficult because the dilute gas approximation is not
valid, and the energetics of the multi-monopole configurations has to
be addressed first.

In this and succeeding papers, we develop a new approach for
systematically including topological degrees of freedom within the
ambit of renormalized perturbation theory. Our technique does not
rely on the existence of stable classical solutions.


This paper is organized as follows: In Sec. 2, we obtain a well 
defined separation of the "topological" and the "spin wave" 
degrees of freedom. We argue that the topological degrees 
survive integration over the spin wave degrees, even though we 
are not expanding about an extremum of the action.
In Sec. 3, we analyse the scattering of a charged vector boson
off a Dirac monopole. We show that there is a remarkable 
simplification of the radial equation  and one polarization 
state decouples only when the anomalous
magnetic moment is two, exactly as required by the Yang-Mills
interaction. In Sec. 4, we obtain the zero modes of the 
Hamiltonian and explain why one polarization
state decouples. In Sec. 5, we re-express the functional integral
using the new variables to bring it to a form where 
perturbative calculation including the topological degree can be
carried out (in the case of one monopole). In Sec. 6, we present our
conclusions.

Separation of "spin waves" and "topological" degrees of freedom in the Yang-Mills
theory  
In Ref. , we have obtained a gauge-invariant
characterization of all possible topological configurations of the
Yang-Mills theory. For this, we considered the eigenvalue equation
S^ab (x)  _b^A(x)=^A(x)  _a^A(x),   A=1,2,3
where  is the  symmetric matrix
S^ab (x)=^a(x) ^b(x),
transforming covariantly (as the adjoint representation) under the
 local gauge group.  The three normalized eigenvectors
 form an orthogonal matrix (field). Points and lines of
singularities of these eigenvectors (or equivalently, loci of
degeneracies of the eigenvalues ) characterize the
topological configurations. In particular, it locates the "topological 
centre" of a monopole configuration such as in Eq. () in a
gauge-invariant manner. This is of great advantage to characterize a
dense gas of monopoles (and other topological objects) especially when
semiclassical techniques are inapplicable.  We may use the orthogonal
matrix  to formally perform a gauge transformation on the
monopole configuration (). The transformed gauge potential
 is
^A = ^A+ ^A
where
 ^A=_a ^A ^a
and
^A=1 2 ^ABC _a ^B_a ^C.
We obtain
^1= K(r) r ,   
^2= - K(r) r ,   
^3= -  r 
where (, , ) are the unit vectors of the
spherical coordinates (, , ).   is precisely
the point Dirac monopole, with two Dirac strings along 
directions.  (We have relabelled the indices , as compared to
Ref. , to have the Dirac monopole for .) Even though
the configuration  Eq. () is non-singular, we have now got a
singular configuration because  is itself singular on the
-axis (the angle  being undefined at  and
). So  is not strictly an allowed local gauge
transformation. Indeed the non-Abelian magnetic field for the gauge
potential  is not zero; rather, 
. Nevertheless, this singular gauge transformation
highlights the topological objects and can be handled without
problems, as will be shown below.

First we show that the Dirac string singularity does not contribute to the action.
In spite of the singularity on the -axis, we have 
 everywhere. Therefore  
^a (x) ^a (x) = (_a^A (x) ^a (x)) (_b^A (x) ^b (x)).
Now,
_a^A  ^a  &=& ( _a^A ^a) -_a^A ^a
- 1 2  ^abc  _a^A ^b ^c  

 &=& ^A - ^ABC  ^B ^C
  -1 2  ^ABC  ^B ^C  

      &=&^A [+ ] - ^A [] =^A [] - ^A [].
Here  stands for the non-Abelian magnetic field for the
gauge potential .  Note that these operations are valid even if
 is singular.  Subtracting by  precisely removes
the singular contribution from the Abelian curl of , which is
the Dirac string magnetic field. This was to be expected because 
  in Eq. () is finite everywhere. Therefore we may simply replace
 by  with the
understanding that the Dirac string should be ignored in computing
.  With this convention,
^3 []=^3 -^1 ^2.
 is the magnetic field of the Dirac monopole (sans
the string) and is singular as  at the monopole centre.
This singularity is precisely cancelled by the non-Abelian interaction
term  since 
for .

To use the Dirac potential for the monopole,
a slightly different singular gauge transformation will be used in the present work,
namely, ,
, and .
The potentials obtained on performing this transformation on the configuration
() may be expressed as
^1+i^2=(- i )K(r) r e^i ,    
^3=1- r .
The cancellation described after Eq. (), of course, still takes place.
It may be noted that the potential given in Eq. () is related to
the potential given in Eq. () by a  gauge transformation.

We advocate this picture obtained in the singular gauge to obtain a
well-defined separation of the topological degrees of freedom and the
'spin waves', and as a means of including the topological degrees
systematically in renormalized perturbation theory. This method can
handle all topological degrees such as vortices, half-monopoles,
half-vortices etc. But in this paper we consider only
monopole configurations such as in Eq. ().

The general ansatz for   is
 with
(x)=_n  q_n _n 1-_n  is the superposition of Dirac potentials of charge  
(in units of ) located at , 
.
Also, , ,  are the spherical coordinates centred at , and 
, ,  are the
corresponding unit vectors. The linear superposition of the (spherically symmetric) magnetic 
fields of the monopoles is distorted by the magnetic fields from the potential  representing
the 'spin wave' degrees of freedom. We will refer to  as the photon . We consider the 
linear combination    (and 
), and refer
to it as the charged vector boson  . The action 
then becomes
S = d^3 x  ( 1 2  ( q_n - _n   - _n^3 
+ + i ^   )^2
+  [+ ] ^2 )  
where we have ignored the Dirac string contribution as was shown before. Here
[]= -iis the Abelian covariant derivative. 

Note that the non-Abelian interaction term from  has
the physical meaning of an anomalous magnetic moment  for the
charged vector boson.  This interaction turns out to provide
remarkable simplification in the scattering of the charged vector
boson off the magnetic monopole, as will be discussed in Sec. 
.  Also the  mode of this interaction provides the core
to regulate the energy of the Dirac monopole in the ultraviolet.

The action is finite only when the singular energy of the point Dirac
monopole is cancelled by the cloud of charged vector bosons around it:
 should behave like
-q_n - _n   - _n^3 +finite terms      for    _n . 
This can be obtained by
(x) (_n - i _n)e^i_n  2 + O( - _n).
Note that this is in accord with the behaviour of the potential given in Eq. ()
near the origin.
As will be seen in Sec. ,
the  mode of the
 boson also has precisely this behaviour.

We have therefore arrived at the picture of a cloud of massless
  charged vector bosons regularizing the energy of Dirac monopoles,
  and photons distorting the (spherically symmetric) magnetic fields
  of the monopoles.  Even though we do not have the stable
  finite-energy classical solutions, we can handle this action
  systematically by renormalized perturbation theory. In this way we can
  include the topological degrees in the usual perturbation theory.
  
  In Eq. (), it might appear that we have expanded the action
  about a background (i.e. Dirac monopole) which is not a solution of the classical
  equations of motion. If such were the case, an integration over
  the quantum fluctuations would wash out the effects of the background,
  as will be
  discussed now. Consider for illustration a (Euclidean) scalar field
  theory
Z = D   e^-S[ ] 
where the action is expanded about a background . If 
is not a solution of the classical equation of motion,
terms linear in the fluctuation
 will be present: 
 where  is the "classical action" and
s[, _0]  =   S[ _0]  _0  
+1 2   ^2 S[ _0] 
 _0 _0  + 
(higher  orders  in  field   ).
In a free theory the higher order terms are absent. In this case
integration over the fluctuations "cancels" the "classical "
contribution . In an interacting theory, we have to
first remove the linear term in  by a shift of the field .
This shift again cancels the "classical " term.

We now argue that the situation is different in our case. Consider 
the theoryZ = DH_  DA_    (-1 4  
(_  A_ -_A_ 
+H_ )^2-s[H_ ] ).
 describes (a part of) the field carrying magnetic charge. We first integrate
over  (say choosing the Landau gauge):
Z = DH_ (-1 4 H_ ^2 +1 2  _H_  
^-2  _H_ -s[H_ ]).
Now  terms are not cancelled out completely:
-1 4 H_ (_ -2 _  _/^2 )
H_ .
The reason is clear: the part of  which is of the form
 is removed by the shift
. The degrees of freedom in 
that are not represented by  give a non-zero contribution.

This analysis is directly relevant to us. In Eq. (), the magnetic field of a
Dirac monopole is a pure gradient, while that of a 'photon' is a pure
curl. Therefore the contribution of the monopole survives the
integration over the gauge potential . Indeed, the cross term of
the monopole field and  is a total derivative and drops out of
the action, as in the case of an expansion about an extrema of the
action. Therefore the topological degrees survive integration over 
the spin wave fluctuations.


A massless charged vector boson scattering off a Dirac monopole 

In this section we obtain the eigenfunctions for a charged vector 
boson in the background of a Dirac monopole.  The results will be used 
in Sec.  to express 
the functional integral in the new modes.  The interaction of a spin-one 
particle with a magnetic monopole has been analyzed before in Ref. . 
We consider here a massless vector boson in contrast to the massive case which 
they have addressed. Our analysis and results turn out to be considerably different.
We find that for precisely the anomalous magnetic moment  as required by the
Yang-Mills interaction Eq.() there is a dramatic simplification of the radial equations.
Also, only in this case, one of the three polarization states of the charged vector
boson decouples in correspondence with the free theory.

The eigenvalue equation we consider is
, where
H= (- iq  r^2 ) 
where  is the energy eigenvalue. Now  stands for the covariant derivative with 
the Dirac potential of a monopole at the origin. We may expand  as follows:
= (r) where  is a function of  only, and the dependence on  and  
is contained in
, which are the monopole vector spherical harmonics for the
monopole of strength . It may be noted that  is defined with
a factor of  : see Eq. (). Here  and  refer to the
eigenvalues of  and  where  is the total angular
momentum .  The orbital angular momentum  of a
charged particle in the magnetic field of a Dirac monopole is given by
. The extra term  is the
well known angular momentum carried by the crossed electric and
magnetic fields, and plays a significant role in the interaction of
the charged particle with the monopole.  is the spin operator
for the vector boson: , (),
acting on the three components of the vector .  We will adopt the
approach of E. J. Weinberg, where the multiplets for
given  and  are labelled by  according as the
eigenvalues of  are . We have
= i r  _  where the only non-vanishing  are
b_0, = -  b_, 0 = a_ 
where  and  . 

Note that  is antisymmetric in its indices. This corrects an error in Ref. .
(In Eq. (3.10) of this reference, 



 is equal to 
 

, and not its negative. The reason is that
not only the integration by parts gives a negative sign, but also the interchange of 
 and 
in the cross-product.)

The following discussion will make it clear that the action of  does not change 
the  and  values for 
the terms in Eq. (). Therefore, henceforth in this section, we take  to be 
an eigenstate of  and , i.e., we consider  
.

Using 
= -i ,     
we then get
= _(-i d dr + i r _)and 
( ) & =& _(-^2  d^2  dr^2 
+_(+) r d dr -  r^2 _

&&-1 r^2 _,  ) 
We put this expression in the eigenvalue equation, and also make use of Eq. ().
This leads to, for  respectively:
-d dr  (+ ) +   ^2  r  &=&
k^2 r                                                     

-d^2 dr^2  + d dr   r 
+  r^2  (- ) + [-q   r^2 ] &=&
k^2                                                       

-d^2 dr^2  + d dr   r 
-  r^2  (- ) - [-q   r^2 ] &=&
k^2  We have bracketted the contribution from the anomalous magnetic moment to highlight an
important cancellation. Using the combinations
= we get
-d dr  +  ^2  r  &=&
k^2 r  

-d^2 dr^2  +  ^2  d dr   r 
+ q   r^2  + [-q   r^2 ] &=&
k^2   

-d^2 dr^2  + q  d dr   r 
+  ^2   r^2  - [q   r^2 ] &=&
k^2   
Precisely due to the anomalous magnetic moment term,  drops out
in Eq. (). This simplifies the equations
dramatically, as shown below. Comparing the derivative (with respect
to ) of Eq. () with Eq. (), we obtain
=  d dr ( r )Plugging this back into Eq. (), we get a simple second-order equation for :
d^2 dr^2  (r ) -  ^2    r 
+k^2  r = 0 
Thus  satisfies precisely the radial equation for a free particle
with the eigenvalue  of  replaced by . If
the anomalous magnetic moment term were not included (or if it had any
value other than ), the equation satisfied by  would be of
third order and contrived.

We may write the equation satisfied by  as
d^2 dr^2  -  ^2  r^2  +k^2= -2q  r^2 
Let us now discuss the relevant solutions to these equations.
 
     Choose ; therefore from Eq. (), . We
          also see from Eq. () that  then satisfies the equation for
          the radial part of the free particle wavefunction  (with
          ). The acceptable solution is
 r = 2kr  J_1 4 + ^2  (kr)
      
         (where  denotes the Bessel function) 
	 with the behaviour  
	 near the origin. Note that the order of the Bessel function is not half-integral,
         in contrast to the case of the usual free-particle radial equation.
         
         In this case, we considered the general solution of the
         homogeneous equation for .
	 Next we consider the particular solution for the inhomogeneous equation. 
     The acceptable solution for  is the same as for
          in Eq. (). The corresponding  are 
         obtained by solving the inhomogeneous equations ()
	 and (). 

We notice that there are only two linearly independent set of
solutions, although there are three 'polarization states' 
for the vector boson. The reason is analogous to the case of free
massless vector bosons.  This will be demonstrated in Sec. .

In solving the eigenvalue equation, we treated all values of  and
 on equal footing.  However, the following cases are special.

 
: There is only one multiplet . 
The mixing matrix  is now formally zero.
So putting  in Eq. (), we get the equation
d^2 dr^2  +q   r^2  +k^2  = 0
for the only non-vanishing radial wavefunction . As  (the equations of Ref. are valid for  only), this effectively has a centrifugal attraction in the place of
centrifugal repulsion.  In Sec. , we use a different basis for this mode. 
: There are only two multiplets, corresponding to . In this case 
 and . We can recover the relevant equation for this case by
simply putting these values in the equations () and ():
d dr  - q  r  +k^2 r q = 0   

d^2 dr^2  - q d dr   r  +k^2
= 0 
We have only one acceptable solution for  and . 

Kernel of the Hamiltonian  
We now obtain the modes of the Hamiltonian with zero eigenvalue. These
are relevant for the gauge-fixing condition as will be
considered later.

We first show that  for any complex function  is a
zero mode . We have
 (- iq  r^2  ) 
&=& (- iq  r^2  )
- iq  r^2    

&=& (- iq  r^2 ) + iq  r^2  - iq  r^2  which is zero because the magnetic field of a monopole is the gradient
of a scalar potential.

It is easy to check that this exhausts all modes of zero energy by
using an expansion in the monopole vector spherical harmonics as in
Sec. . We just need to consider Eqs.
()-() with . The equations may be written as
d  dr - ^2  r  &=&0 

d^2 dr^2  ( q  ^2  - ) -   ^2 r^2 
( q  ^2  - ) &=& 0          
The non-zero solutions of Eq. () are  (for all ) with
. They do not
give normalizable solution. Therefore we need to consider only the
trivial solution of Eq. (), namely, . In this case,
substituting  and  as given by these equations in favour of
 into Eq. (), we get
&=& ( + 1 2a_+   (+ ) + 1 2a_-   (- ) )   

&=& 1  ^2 [d  dr  Y_qJM  +
(   ^2 +q 2   +    ^2 - q 2   ) ]  

&=& 1  ^2  ( d  dr  + ) Y_qJM 
= where . 
Here we used the expressions for  given in Eqs. (3.6) of Ref. .
This confirms that the only 
zero-energy solutions are of the form .

Now the eigenfunctions for  are orthogonal to the
eigenfunctions for .  Therefore  for arbitrary
, so that (on integration by parts) 
It is this
constraint which leaves only two independent polarization states for
the eigenfunctions.

It is interesting that only by including the anomalous magnetic moment
interaction (as required by the Yang-Mills interaction) we get these zero
modes. We now show that there are no zero modes without this term.
In this case the zero modes are the solutions of
( )  = 0
We may first solve  (where ).
Expanding  in vector harmonics, as in Eq. (), we get the
following equation for the radial part:
- d  dr + _   r  = 0.
This gives
&=& 0   

d  dr  &=&  ^2    r    

d  dr  &=& q    r  
Therefore  and  can at best be a constant. Thus the
most general solution is , where  is arbitrary.
Thus for the zero modes,  is  times a function of  and .
This is not
normalizable, and hence there are no acceptable zero modes.

It has been noted many times in literature that the natural
value for the gyromagnetic ratio of an elementary charged particle
coupling to the electromagnetic field is . Many reasons suggest
this. It has been observed in that for the charged vector
boson interacting with the photon, only for  there is a local
gauge invariance . This is a generalization
of the invariance in the free theory which implies that one polarization
state is unphysical. (This is part of the
non- Abelian gauge invariance for us.)


Functional integral in terms of the new modes  
In this section we express the functional integral given by Eqs. 
() and () in terms of the new modes.
Henceforth  only.
We will separate the  mode  as it plays a
special role: , where,
_0  = w(r) C^+ _100   is the  mode and
_1  =_- ^  dk   (k) (kr) involves all higher  modes. Here 
represents the amplitudes for the two linearly independent solutions
 of the radial
equations when . For  there is only one solution, and
 only in this case.  The orthonormality conditions are
d   C^ _qJM   
C^ _qJ^' M^'   1 r^2 
_JJ^'   _MM^'   _ 
and
_  _0^  d r f^ _qJM  (kr)
f^ _qJM  (k^' r)
=(k-k') _  .
Note that the vector monopole harmonics  are defined with a
 factor. As a result, the measure in Eq. ()
is  and not .

The vector harmonic for  is special. It is both (covariant)
divergence and curl free. The expression for this harmonic is

C^+ _100   = -i 8   r  e^i 
[This can be explicitly checked. In terms of the
components of a transverse vector ,
the equation  reads
  (W_)
+  W_-i(1-)W_while
 reads
  (W_)
-  W_+i(1-)W_ r (rW_)=0,   
 r (rW_)=0.
Note that our definition of the components  and 
differ from those of Ref. .]
Therefore .
This is precisely of the type to give a form factor to the point
Dirac monopole. We get
 r^2  + i ^  =
 r^2  ( 1 - w(r)^2 4   )
+i (_0 ^   _1  + _1 ^    _0 
+ _1 ^    _1 )
If in addition  satisfies the boundary condition
w(r)^2 4  = 1+O(r^2),    r 0,
the action is finite. Thus the  mode of the  boson can 
regularize the energy of the Dirac monopole as a consequence of its anomalous 
magnetic moment. The boundary condition 
is necessary to relate (through a singular
gauge transformation) our singular fields to non-singular Yang-Mills 
potentials as in the t'Hooft -Polyakov ansatz  Eq. (), as noted
in Sec. .

For , the (allowed) eigenfunctions of the radial equation ()
has the behaviour 
near the origin for any . As we want the boundary 
condition , we will not use this complete set 
of radial functions for the 
 mode. Instead, we consider the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian
  without the anomalous magnetic moment term. For the ansatz 
(), the eigenvalue equation is now simply

-d^2 w dr^2  =k^2 w
since  is zero. 
Now the radial wave function  is a linear combination of the Fourier
modes  and hence not required to vanish at . 

Using the orthonormality
of , we have

d   _0 ^   _1  =0
because  does not change the  values when
acting on . Therefore Eq. () gives
1 2  d^3  x  (  r^2  + i ^   )^2
&=&dr  2  r^2  ( 1 - w(r)^2 4   )^2 

&&-i d^3  x ( 1 - w(r)^2 4   ) _1 ^   r^2 
_1 

&&- 1 2  d^3  x (_0 ^   _1  + _1 ^   _0 
+ _1 ^   _1 )^2

Also
d^3  x   ^2 &=& d^3  x   ^  ()


&=&d^3  x   (
_0 ^  (_0 ) 
+ _1 ^  (_1 ) )
This is because the  operation does not change the  values when
acting on  and therefore  there are no terms mixing  and .
We have,

d^3  x   _0 ^  (_0 )
= - dr w^*  (r) d^2 dr^2  w(r)
We will include the anomalous magnetic moment term

In Sec.   we showed that the eigenfunctions with non-zero 
energy satisfy the constraint . Even though we are
not using the eigenfunctions of  for the  mode, this condition is valid
for this case too:

_0 
= dw(r) dr  C^+ _100   
+  w(r) C^+ _100  =0.
Therefore the "natural gauge condition" for  is .
For the 'photon' , we may simply choose the gauge condition
.

The functional measure is also simply transformed. Because of the 
orthonormality of the basis in Eqs. () and (),
D^     D= _J,M,  d(k) Dw(r).
This completes the expression of the functional integral (for the case
of one monopole) using the new variables. It is in the form where
perturbative calculations including the topological degree can be
carried out. The free energy of one monopole in the leading order
will be presented elsewhere.


Conclusion  

In this paper, we have initiated a method for systematically including topological
degrees of freedom within the ambit of renormalized perturbation theory. We
have argued that conventional semi-classical techniques are inapplicable for 
the case of pure gauge theories. Given the
advantages and successes of renormalized perturbation theory,
it is obviously better to adapt it to include the topological 
degrees systematically. We have addressed the
Yang-Mills theory in three Euclidean dimensions
in this paper. We have obtained a well-defined separation of the topological and
"spin wave" degrees of freedom motivated by a singular gauge. 
The picture is simple enough: 
stray magnetic fields distorting the spherically symmetric magnetic fields of
Dirac monopoles, and massless charged vector bosons scattering off the latter.
We have explicitly shown that the Dirac string does not contribute.
We have considered the case of one monopole in detail. The  mode of the
vector boson interactions gives precisely the core to make the energy of the 
monopole (ultraviolet) finite. 
The radial
equations are dramatically simplified
exactly with the anomalous magnetic moment
 as required by the Yang-Mills symmetry. Also one polarization state of the
vector boson decouples.
We can evaluate the free energy of one monopole in the functional integral
by formally setting the gauge coupling constant  to zero, and evaluate corrections to it 
in perturbation theory. It is to be noted that due to the Dirac quantization condition on the
monopole charge, the effects of the monopole does not disappear even when .
This calculation and the effects of a gas of (anti-)monopoles  will be presented elsewhere.
