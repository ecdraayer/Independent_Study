We argue that   
two-dimensional   gauged linear sigma models are not destabilized
by instanton
generated world-sheet superpotentials. We construct several examples where we show
this to be true. The general proof is based on the Konishi anomaly for
 theories.
 




Introduction 
One of the basic questions we ask about quantum field theory is
whether the classical vacua are stable. Often, the structure of the
quantum moduli space is significantly different from the classical
moduli space. The theories about which we can usually say the most are
supersymmetric. In these cases, we can often make exact statements,
either perturbative or non-perturbative, 
because of non-renormalization
theorems. In cases where the vacuum structure is not renormalized at
any finite order in perturbation theory, non-perturbative effects, like
instantons, can still generate superpotentials which modify or destabilize
perturbative vacua. Numerous examples of this kind have been studied
in various dimensions; for example, N=1 supersymmetric QCD in four  
dimensions . 

The aim of this work is to study the stability of 
two-dimensional gauge theories, both massive and massless, with
 world-sheet supersymmetry. On the string world-sheet, the
terminology  supersymmetry
refers to theories with  left-moving and  right-moving
supersymmetries. Conformal field theories with
 supersymmetry are a key ingredient in building perturbative
heterotic string compactifications (for a review,
see ). 
Unlike their  cousins,
theories with  supersymmetry that are conformal to
all orders in perturbation theory can still be destabilized by
world-sheet instantons. The usual phrasing of this problem is that
world-sheet instantons generate a space-time  
superpotential . However, the general belief is
that this destabilization is generic. Under special conditions
described in  for non-linear sigma models, there
can be extra fermion zero
modes in an instanton background which kill any non-perturbative
superpotential. 

We consider those  models which can be constructed as IR limits
of gauged linear sigma models . This is a rather
nice class of models which can be conformal or non-conformal, and
which can flow to theories with IR descriptions like sigma models or
Landau-Ginzburg theories. For perturbatively conformal cases, some
criteria for the absence of a space-time superpotential have been
described in 
. 
Our interest is in whether a
world-sheet superpotential is generated. In perturbatively conformal
cases, the two questions should be related in a way that we will
describe. 

In the following section, we
consider the stability of  theories without tree level
superpotentials. We construct several examples of non-conformal
 models without tree level superpotentials for which we show
that no world-sheet superpotential is generated by instantons. This
result surprised us initially since we were looking for a model with
an instanton generated superpotential! In section three, we give a
general  argument based on the Konishi
anomaly  that this is true for all
gauged linear sigma models without tree level superpotentials. This
argument is inspired in part by recent progress in four-dimensional
gauge theories . We then
extend  the argument to cases with a tree level
superpotential. In all cases, it appears that a non-perturbative
superpotential is forbidden. 

Lastly, we consider the implication of our results for the
space-time superpotential. Based on the absence of a non-perturbative
world-sheet superpotential,  we argue that there is no corresponding 
space-time instability. Some related observations will appear
in . 



Some (0,2) Examples 

In this section we construct examples of  gauged linear 
sigma models   without tree level
superpotentials. We will show that no superpotential is generated by
non-perturbative instanton or anti-instanton effects. It is actually sufficient to
consider one instanton contributions. Higher instanton numbers
generate more fermion zero modes which obstruct the generation of a
superpotential. 

A bundle over  

The  superspace and superfield notations are reviewed in
Appendix . We begin by considering a  gauge theory.
The  action is given by a sum of terms
S=S_g + S_ch  + S_F + S_D   + S_Jwhere  are canonical kinetic terms for the
gauge-fields, bosonic chiral superfields, and fermionic chiral
superfields, respectively. The explicit form of these actions appear
in Appendix . The Fayet-Iliopoulos -term and  
the theta angle appear in  while  contains any tree
level superpotential. For these models, we set . 

As our first example, we construct a linear sigma model whose IR
limit is a non-linear sigma model on . This is a cousin of the
 model studied in . 
Apart from the  gauge superfields  and ,  we have
bosonic superfields  where , and a single Fermi
superfield .  Each  carries gauge charge
 while  carries gauge charge . 
Since we do not have a tree level superpotential our action is
S=S_g + S_ch  + S_F + S_D  . Solving for the auxiliary fields gives the following bosonic potential for the 
 U= D^2 2 e^2 = e^2 2  ( _i  _i^2-r)^2.
We take  to be positive, and set . After modding by the
 gauge symmetry, we see that the target space is .  

The Fermi superfield determines the gauge-bundle over   which,
in this case, is the line bundle . 
These particular gauge charge assignments guarantee gauge anomaly
cancellation, which is a basic consistency requirement. 
This can be seen either by computing the requisite one loop diagrams,
or by checking that the condition for anomaly cancellation ch  _2 (TM) = ch  _2 (V) is satisfied. Here,  is the tangent bundle of , 
is the  line bundle, and  is the second Chern character. 
Using the definition 
 we
see that both sides of this equation gives , where  is the
curvature -form of the hyperplane bundle over . 

   
This theory is massive (like the   model) because the
sum of the gauge charges of the
right moving fermions is non-zero. The theory does, at the classical level, have a chiral
 symmetry under which  carry
charges (), where  is any integer.  This symmetry is
anomalous at one-loop for any  . The charge of the gaugino,
, does not matter in the anomaly computation because it is
not charged in a  theory. Since this chiral symmetry is
anomalous, we can shift the theta angle to any value, and we choose to
set it to zero.

Let us now consider how instantons modify the perturbative theory.
First we construct the one instanton BPS solution. In order to construct
an instanton solution, we wick rotate to Euclidean space sending 
 
The Euclideanised bosonic action is
 S= d^2   y  [  1 2e^2  v_12 ^2 + _i 
_ _i^2 +e^2 2 ( _i  _i^2-^2)^2 ]. We construct the well known vortex instanton solution 
 of the Abelian Higgs model in two dimensions: take
=0 for =2,3,4 and take non-zero  and gauge
fields. From now on  we refer to  as  for brevity. We
also set . In polar coordinates, the one-instanton configuration is given by
v_r =0, v_ = v(r), = f(r) e^i  where for large , 
v(r) 1 r  + constant   e^- r  r ,f(r) + constant   e^-2  r ,and . 
The Bogomolnyi equations are
(D_1 +i D_2)and 
 D + v_12 =0.On evaluating eact  in this background, we easily obtain the usual
instanton  action . Next, we
are interested in  constructing the fermion zero modes in this
instanton background.  They are explicitly given by
^0 =   _+^0 _-^0  = 
  -2  (D  _1  + iD  _2)  D-v_12  
 _-^0  =^2, and
  _+i ^0 =    for . Note that these zero modes are normalizable because of
the exponential fall off of the fields at large distances. The  fermion
zero mode is actually the zero mode generated by the broken
supersymmetry generator. In
order to see this, we must examine the supersymmetry transformations
in the instanton background. 

The supersymmetry transformations become involved because we must also
make gauge transformations to preserve Wess-Zumino gauge. The relevent
supersymmetry transformations are given by
  _+ &=& -i 2  (D  _0 + D  _1)
  _-,  _- &=& i D _- + v_01  _-. The supersymmetry parameter, , corresponds to . Wick
rotating to Euclidean space gives the zero mode found in
fzm . Hence,  is the broken supersymmetry while the
 supersymmetry is still preserved by the instanton
background. Using the Bogomolnyi equations, it is not hard to check
that the   zero mode does satisfy 
where  is the Dirac-Higgs operator
i /D   =  -i ( D  _1-i D  _2) 
& 2  i   -2  i & i _1
  -_2 . The field  is expanded in modes of the Dirac operator 
 (note that  has gauge charge
). The  () fields are expanded in modes
of the Dirac operator . We ask again
whether there are any zero modes for these fields. 
The existence of zero modes for these operators can be predicted using
 index theory and a vanishing theorem . Note that 
in Minkowski space, 
. However, in Euclidean space 
 and  are independent fermionic fields and not 
the conjugates of each other. Here,  
and so in the Euclidean formulation of the theory, the 
 () zero modes are zero modes of negative 
chirality while the  zero mode is a zero mode of 
positive chirality. 


We can now ask what gauge invariant correlators are non-vanishing in
this instanton background. There are only two
possibilities
  _+   _+2    _+3 
      _+4    _- ^2 ,     _-   _+2   _+3   _+4 
	     _- . 
which can have a non-zero vacuum expectation value in the instanton
background. However, neither of these terms could be generated by a
term in the  superpotential since there are far too many
fermion zero modes. A superpotential term could absorb, at most, two
fermion zero modes. Therefore, we see that there is no
instanton generated superpotential. The same argument applies to
instantons embedded in the other . 


 Next we show that there is no superpotential generated by a one
 anti-instanton  contribution. The details are very similar to the one
 instanton case so we shall be brief. The ani-instanton configuration
 is similar to the instanton case except
= f(r) e^-i  and for large , 
v(r) -1 r  + constant     e^-  r  r .The Bogomolnyi equations are now
(D_1 -i D_2)and 
D - v_12 =0leading to the anti-instanton action . The
 normalizable fermion zero  modes are now given by
^0 =  _+^0   _-^0  =  
 -2  (D_1 + i D_2)D+ v_12  
_-^0  =  ^2and
 _+i ^0 = for . Again the fermion zero mode analysis rules out the
 generation of a gauge invariant superpotential. Hence we see that
 there is no superpotential generated by a one anti-instanton
 contribution.

Changing the bundle 

 We can also consider the case where  carries gauge charge
 . This leads to a  line bundle over . The
 gauge anomaly cancellation condition is satisfied as the anomaly is
 proportional to the square of the charges. The model is still
 massive, and we again ask whether a superpotential is generated. 

In this case, we find the same  zero modes
(for ) in the instanton background. However, there is now a zero
mode for the field  which is expanded in modes of the Dirac
operator . The zero mode is given by

Again this is normalizable given the exponential decay of the fields
at large distances. Once again a gauge invariant superpotential cannot
be generated. Similar arguments hold for the case of the
anti-instanton. Hence for both line bundles, , over
,  no world-sheet superpotential is generated. These theories
are non-perturbatively stable.

A different route to stability 

In the previous examples, a superpotential was forbidden because of
the large number of zero modes in an (anti-)instanton background. 
We now turn to an example where we have the right number of fermion
zero modes for a superpotential, but we will show that even in this
case, there is no superpotential generated. 

We consider a theory with one bosonic superfield, , carrying
gauge charge  and one Fermi superfield, , carrying gauge
charge . There are also the required gauge superfields  and
. This gauge charge assignment causes the gauge anomaly to
cancel. We can also set the theta angle to zero because of the
non-zero chiral anomaly. We again construct vortex instanton solutions
satisfying the Bogomolnyi equations bone  and btwo . The
fermion zero modes are  as in fzm  and 
. In this case, we see that 
 
can get a non-zero vacuum expectation value in the instanton
background. This would lead to the existence of a superpotential
S= -a 2   d^2   y  d  
      ^+      _^+ =0  where  is a constant that can be determined. Hence the 
theory would be rendered unstable by this non-perturbative
effect. However, the condensate has a vacuum expectation value proportional to
d^2   x_0  (D  _1 +i D  _2)  where we have integrated over the two bosonic translational zero
modes . Using the identity
2i (D  _1 +i D  _2)   + (_1 +i
_2 )  (D - v_12 ) =0,which can be proven using the Bogomolnyi equations, we see that this
integral is actually zero!  Yet again there is no instanton generated
superpotential.

Lastly, we consider the case where  has a gauge charge . In
 this case,  we can obtain  and  from a single 
 chiral superfield. The fermion zero modes are  as in fzm 
 and . However, the possibility 
 cannot be generated from a
 superpotential bacause of holomorphy of the
 superpotential. Therefore, no superpotential is generated at
 all. This certainly agrees with the  non-renormalization
 theorem. From these examples, we see no non-perturbative
 superpotential generated. These results together with our other
 attempts at finding  examples with
 non-vanishing superpotentials suggest that this phenomena is quite
 generic. In the next section, we give a general argument explaining why this happens.   
    
The  Konishi Anomaly 
Deriving the anomaly 

  In this section, we obtain the Konishi anomaly 
for the  linear sigma model with no tree level
superpotential. Because of a perturbative non-renormalization theorem,
the only superpotential that can possibly be generated is a
non-perturbative one. From the Konishi anomaly relation that we
obtain, we argue that no such non-perturbative superpotential can be
generated  by instantons. This generalizes the results of the previous
section. 


 Our derivation of the Konishi anomaly is along the lines
 of  which is a superspace generalization of
 Fujikawa's functional integral method . 
We start with the linear sigma model with no tree level
 superpotential. We assume that a superpotential is generated
 non-perturbatively. Hence, 

 
where  is the non-perturbative superpotential
 contribution. We want to prove that  in the (anti-)instanton
 background. We denote all the chiral superfields by , i.e.,
 , and the corresponding
 anti-chiral superfields by . The partition function is
 given by 
Z= [D _i ^0 D _i  ^0 D  _a^0 D  
  _a^0 D D V ]  e^iS . In the functional integral formalism, all the fields in the path
 integral measure, 

 
are independent, and one can study their transformations separately. 

We consider a global axial  transformation  given by
 
The subscript  signifies that only one of the fields in 
transforms non-trivially. To extract a Ward identity in superspace, we
consider the following transformation
_m _m'= e^i A  _m where  is a chiral superfield satisfying . This
leads to a change in the measure and action
Z= [D _m ...]  e^i S = [D _m' ...]   
e^i S' = [D _m ...]  J   e^i S + i S .  For an infinitesimal transformation,
S= -i 2  d^2   y  d^2   
  _i (D  _0 -D  _1) i A _i -1   2  
d^2   y  d   ^+ _a  _a   J^a _i   i A _i _  ^+=0  
if  is a bosonic chiral superfield, and
S= -1 2  d^2   y  d^2   	    _a   i A _a -1 2  	  d^2   y   d   ^+ i A _a  J^a  _  ^+=0  
if  is a Fermi superfield. Also,
 J  = det_c    (_m '   _m )= det_c    (-i A D  _+)= e^tr_c    (- i A D  _+) .The reason for the subscript , which means chiral, will be clear in
a moment. The trace originally involves integration over  and
. Using the relation
d     ^+=      ^+   = - D  _+ +i ^+ (_0 +
  _1), we have replaced the integral over   by an insertion
  of  in jac . The second term in simplify  is
  a total derivative which we can drop since we integrate over . 
The remaining superspace integral in the chiral trace only involves
, and is therefore a chiral integral. 


We regulate the trace in the following way
 tr_c   ^reg    (- i A D  _+)=  lim  _M
    tr_c    (- i A  e^L M^2   D  _+) 
where 
L= -i 2  D  _+   e^-  (D  _0 -
    D  _1)   e^-  D_+    e^2  . 
Note that  respects manifest supersymmetry and is chiral because . 
The  gauge transformation acts by
e^  e^-i   e^  e^i ,
V V + (_0 -_1)(  +). 
So under a gauge transformation
L L'= e^-2i   L e^2i  . Hence  is gauge covariant as well. We now proceed to compute the
regulated trace in regtr . We have 
 L= -i 2  e^-  e^-  D_+  e^2  
-i 2  e^-  (D  _0 -D  _1) (2i(D  _0 +
D  _1)- D  _+ D    _+ ) e^ . 
 From the regulated trace in regtr , it is clear that  always
acts on .  So we have a non zero contribution only if we
have a factor of  along with  since 
 
This is possible when one factor of  is brought down
from the exponential. To get a non-zero contribution, we have to set
 in the first term in the expression for . The last term in
exL  involving   does not
contribute. Also the second term involving 
 term contributes with  . So acting on ,
  L= -i 2  D_+  +(D  _0 -D  _1)
(D  _0 +D  _1).The leading term in the regulated trace is given by dropping the
background  gauge field terms in the second term in simL  leading to
L= -i 2  D_+ +( _0 ^2 - _1 ^2).
Hence, the regulated trace gives
tr_c   ^reg    (-i A D  _+)= i d^2   y
 d   ^+  A 8  .
Finally, we obtain the Ward identity
1 2  D  _+   _i (D  _0 - D  _1)
_i  = -i 2  _a  _a   J^a _i   _i _  ^+ =0  + 8   for the bosonic chiral superfields, and
 1 2  D  _+   _a _a = 1   2   _a J^a _  ^+ =0  + i  8   for the Fermi superfields. They can be combined and written as
 D  _+ J = i S_J _m 
_m  _  ^+ =0   +  8  . Equation ward  and its conjugate obtained from considering
anti-chiral transformations are the Konishi anomaly equations for the
 linear  sigma model. 

Applying the Konishi equations 

Now the relation ward  is a rather beautiful operator relation. We
can take the expectation value of ward  in a BPS (anti-)instanton
background. The left hand side is trivial in the chiral ring, and
vanishes by fermion zero mode counting.  We therefore obtain the general result
i S_J _m  _m
_  ^+  =0  = -  8   for all . Similarly from anti-chiral transformations, we obtain
i S_J   _m  
      _m  _^+ =0  =       8    for all .  From
the component  expansion for  and , we see
that the lowest component and the top component have vanishing vacuum
expectation value because of Lorentz invariance: they involve the one
point function of a fermion. The middle component of  is 
 
while that of  is 
 
Wick rotating to Euclidean space, we find that
 _a J^a _  ^+ =0  = 
^+ 2 2   D - v_12 and
  _a J  ^a _^+ =0  
=   ^+  2 2   D + v_12  for all . In the (anti-)instanton background, both 
 and  vanish because of fermion zero
modes.  Actually for theories with a broken chiral  symmetry,
this vanishing also follows independently from the Bogomolnyi equations. For
example, in an instanton background  we
see that secondkon  vanishes using the Bogomolnyi equation btwo . The
right hand side of firstkon   is proportional to 
 which, in turn, is proportional to
 .  However, because of the broken chiral
 symmetry, all theta vacuua are equivalent and we can set theta to
zero. The same analysis holds for the anti-instanton case leading to
the final result that  in an (anti-)instanton background 
_a J^a _  ^+ =0   =    _a  
J  ^a _^+ =0  =0. We  conclude that , and no non-perturbative
superpotential is generated. 

Cases with tree level superpotentials 

What changes when we add a tree level superpotential? It appears that
not a great deal changes in the preceeding argument. 
We replace  by the sum of the tree
level superpotential, , and any non-perturbative
superpotential,  . The derivation just given goes through
without further change, and we obtain the same equations
firstkon  and secondkon . Evaluated in an instanton background,
it again appears that the total superpotential must vanish. At first sight,
this might appear to be a contradiction since, by construction,
 is non-zero. 

However, the condition for an instanton to be BPS is now modified. In
the presence of a superpotential, the BPS condition requires J_a^0 = 0 
so the Konishi relation is satisfied. Beyond multiplicatively
renormalizing , it seems that a  non-perturbative
superpotential is again ruled out. 

The space-time superpotential 

Lastly, for perturbatively conformal models, we want to address the
question of whether the absence of a
world-sheet superpotential implies the absence of a space-time
superpotential. In models with no tree level superpotential, we can
argue this relation as follows: a space-time superpotential implies
that our perturbatively conformal theories, which we can label by the
parameter , do not flow to a family of
superconformal field theories
with a corresponding  modulus. Let us just consider the dependence
on . For example, they might flow to a
trivial theory with .  

How can  be renormalized? In the action,  appears in the
term

We need to ask whether  can be renormalized in an instanton
background. Now  is bosonic, and we must absorb fermion zero
modes. Where can they come from? The only place we see is a
non-perturbative superpotential. The perturbative Lagrangian will not
do because the zero modes are chiral. Since no world-sheet superpotential is
generated,  remains an exactly marginal parameter and no
space-time superpotential is generated. 

What if there is a tree level world-sheet superpotential? In this case, fermion
zero modes could be absorbed from the Yukawa terms generated from the
superpotential. So fermion zero mode counting does not rule out
renormalization of . 
However, using the Bogomolnyi equations, the remaining bosonic
integral is always of the form

where  is a non-negative integer, and we have embedded the
instanton in .  However, this integral
over the two
translational zero modes (with  as the Euclidean world-sheet)
vanishes. Again, it appears that no
space-time superpotential is generated.

The Structure of  Superspace 

We review  superspace following . 
We shall be dealing with abelian gauge theories. The superspace for
 theories has 
bosonic coordinates  and fermionic coordinates 
. 
The supersymmetry generators act in superspace in the following way 
Q_+ &=&  ^+  +i   ^+
(_0 + _1), 

Q  _+ &=& -   ^+  -i
^+ (_0 + _1). On the other hand, the superspace covariant derivatives are given by
D_+ &=&  ^+  -i   ^+
(_0 + _1), 

 D  _+ &=& -   ^+  +i
^+ (_0 + _1). The following multiplets and the corresponding actions are used in
various sections of the main text.

The gauge multiplet 

The superspace gauge covariant derivatives 
 and 
 () satisfy the algebra
D  _+^2 = D   _+^2 =0,  D  _+,
    D   _+  =2i (D  _0+D  _1). The first two equations imply that 
 and 
where  takes values in the Lie algebra of the gauge group. In  Wess-Zumino gauge, 
 
We also have
D  _0 + D  _1 &=& _0 + _1 +i(v_0 +
v_1), 

 D  _+ &=& ^+  -i   ^+
(D  _0 + D  _1), 

 D   _+ &=& -   ^+  +i
^+  (D  _0 + D  _1), 

 D  _0 - D  _1 &=& _0 -_1 +iV, where  is given by
V= v_0 - v_1 -2i ^+   _- -2i   ^+ 
_- +2 ^+   ^+ D. The gauge invariant field strength is 
 which has a corresponding action, 
S_g = 1 8 e^2  d^2   y  d^2   
  = 1 e^2  d^2   y 
(1 2 v_01 ^2  +i   _- (_0 +
_1)_-  +1 2  D^2  ). The chiral multiplet 

There are bosonic chiral superfields  satisfying
. Defining ,
we see that . Here  has the component expansion
_i = _i +2  ^+ _+i  -i ^+
      ^+ (D_0 + D_1)_i. This corresponding gauge invariant action is given by
 S_ch  &=&  - i 2  d^2   y  d^2   
_i    _i(D  _0 -D  _1)_i 
 &=&     d^2   y _i  (- D_  _i^2 +i
      _+i (D_0 - D_1) _+i  -i Q_i 2 
      _i _- _+i  & & +i Q_i 2  _i
      _+i    _-  + Q_i D _i ^2)
    where  has a  charge .

The Fermi multiplet 

There are also fermionic chiral superfields, , with
negative chirality  satisfying 
 
where  satisfies . Defining 
 and , the Fermi superfield has a component expansion
_a = _-a  -2  ^+ G_a -i ^+
      ^+ (D_0 + D_1) _ -a  -2 
      ^+ E_a. We will consider cases where . In this case, the kinetic terms
for the Fermi multiplet are given by
S_F= -1 2  d^2   y  d^2    _a 
      _a _a = d^2   y  _a  (i
      _-a   (D_0 + D_1) _-a  + G_a ^2).The  term 

The terms in the action containing the Fayet-Iliopoulos -term and  
the theta term are given by
S_D  =  t 4  d^2   y  d   ^+
_ ^+=0  +h.c. = d^2   y  (-r D +
 2   v_01 )where .


The superpotential term 

The  superpotential is given by
S_J &=& -1 2    d^2   y  d   ^+
