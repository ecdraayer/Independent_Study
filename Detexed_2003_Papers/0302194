hep-th/0302194  Chiral Ring Of 
And  
 Supersymmetric Gauge Theory In Four Dimensions    
Edward Witten 
Institute For Advanced Study, Princeton NJ 08540 USA 




The chiral ring of classical supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with
gauge group  or  is computed, extending previous
work (of Cachazo, Douglas, Seiberg, and the author)
for .
The result is that, as has been conjectured, the ring is generated
by the usual glueball superfield ,
with the relation ,  being the dual Coxeter number.
Though this proposition has important implications for the
behavior of the quantum theory, the statement and (for the most
part) the proofs amount to assertions about Lie groups with no
direct reference to gauge theory.

Introduction 

R  
In four-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory,  the basic
gauge invariant operator is the superspace field strength
,  (and its hermitian conjugate 
).  transforms in the adjoint
representation of the gauge group, which we will take to be a
simple Lie group ; we denote its Lie algebra as  and
let  denote an invariant quadratic form on . (For
classical Lie groups, we will take  to be the trace in the
fundamental representation.)  is a fermionic operator of
dimension , and is chiral , that is, it is annihilated
by the supersymmetries of one chirality: 
.

Gauge-invariant polynomials in the , such as 
,  are likewise
chiral. In this paper, we consider the "pure" supersymmetric
gauge theory without matter multiplets.  In this theory, the
gauge-invariant polynomials in  are the only chiral
superfields of importance. However, such a polynomial is
considered trivial if it is proportional to a linear combination
of expressions  for any . The
reason for this is the identityThis identity follows
directly from the superspace definition 
.  W_,
W_=Q^ ,D_ W_, 
which implies that any gauge-invariant expression
 is a
descendant, that is, it can be written as 
 for some , and
hence decouples from the expectation value of a product of chiral
operators.

Mathematical Description Of The Problem 

The problem of classifying modulo descendants the chiral operators
in supersymmetric gauge theory  is of mathematical as well as
physical interest. Before proceeding, let us reformulate the
problem mathematically. We introduce a -graded ring  that
is generated by the components of the .  Explicitly,
picking a basis ,  of , we write
, and then  is generated by the
(odd) variables .  In the ring  we define an ideal
 that is generated by the components of .
In more detail, we write 

 (where
).  Thus,  is generated by the
even, nilpotent elements 
, for all , and .  Elements of  are
descendants; the quotient ring  is the ring of chiral
operators mod descendants.  The ideal  is clearly
-invariant, so  acts on .  The -invariant chiral
operators mod descendants form the classical approximation to the
physical "chiral ring" of the theory. So in the classical
supersymmetric gauge theory, the chiral ring is ,
where  denotes the -invariant part of , and the
subscript "" means "classical" (we recall shortly how
quantum corrections deform the picture). An element of 
can be represented by a -invariant element of  that is not
in .

If we consider the  to be of degree one, then the ideal
 is graded - its generators being homogeneous of degree two -
and hence the classical chiral ring  is a graded ring.
There is no non-trivial element of  in degree one (since
there is no gauge-invariant linear function of the ). In
degree two, since  and 
 are  contained in , any
element of  is a multiple of .
The degree two part of  is thus a one-dimensional
vector space, generated by S=W_1W_2=12 _^ W_W_.  (Here
,  is the antisymmetric
tensor with .  It is conventional to include a
factor of  in the definition of ; this factor,
which is motivated by instanton considerations, will play no role
in the present paper and we will omit it.)

The conjecture F. Cachazo, M. Douglas, N. Seiberg, and
E. Witten, "Chiral Rings And Anomalies In Supersymmetric Gauge
Theory," hep-th/0211170, JHEP 0212:071,2002 .  that we will
be exploring in the present paper is that for any simple Lie group
 with dual Coxeter number , the ring  is generated
by  with the relation . In , this conjecture was
proved for , and certain partial results were obtained for
other groups. For the classical Lie groups ( and  as
well as ) it was proved that  is generated by .
(This was also proved in A. Ceresole, G. Dall'Agata, R.
D'Auria, and S. Ferrara, "Spectrum Of Type IIB Supergravity on
: Predictions On  SCFT's,"
hep-th/9905226, Phys. Rev. D61  (2000) 066001. .) For any Lie
group  of rank , it was proved that  in
. The purpose of the present paper is to prove the
conjecture for  and . Most of the arguments are
similar to those in , but for  one important step in

The rings and ideals  and  all admit an
action of , under which the ,
 transform in the two-dimensional representation.
Physically, this  originates from an 
rotation symmetry of the four-dimensional gauge theory.  It will
not play an important role in the present paper.  The conjecture
about the structure of  implies in any case that
 acts trivially on .

Significance For Physics 

To conclude this introduction, let us recall  the main
reason for the physical interest of the conjecture.  First we must
discuss the quantum deformation of the ring . Our
definition of  was a classical approximation to the
analogous  chiral ring  of the quantum theory. For any
, the operator , which has dimension  and carries
charge  with respect to the  symmetry of the classical
theory, has just the quantum numbers of a one-instanton
contribution to correlation functions. Hence it is possible that
the classical relation  in the ring  could be
deformed in the quantum ring   to  a relation of the
form S^h=c^3h ,    with some constant .  This
is the only such deformation that is possible if the conjectured
structure of  is correct. (A -instanton amplitude has
the quantum numbers of  and so for  cannot modify the
classical relation .) In fact, explicit instanton
calculations -   can be interpreted, as we
will recall in section 5, as showing that this deformation does
arise, with essentially ,  being the one-instanton
action.

The quantum deformation of the classical ring  to a
quantum ring  has a perhaps more familiar analog in two
dimensions.   In the context of two-dimensional supersymmetric
sigma models, the classical cohomology ring of (for example) 
, which is generated by a degree two element  obeying
, is naturally deformed to a quantum cohomology ring in
which the relation is .  In this case,   is the
area of a holomorphic curve of degree one (computed using a Kahler
metric on  that is introduced to define the sigma
model). One difference between the four-dimensional gauge theories
and the two-dimensional sigma models is that in four dimensions
the starting point, which is the ring  associated with a
Lie group, is less familiar mathematically than the classical
cohomology of .


The quantum relation  has a striking consequence.  It
implies that in any supersymmetric vacuum,  must have a nonzero
expectation value, equal to  (for one of the 
possible values of ). In fact, since

 for any 
in any supersymmetric vacuum,  implies that in a
supersymmetric vacuum 
. But expectation values of
products of chiral operators factorize , so in particular
.  So we get 
, whence 
, as claimed.

From this, we can deduce more.  The supersymmetric gauge theory in
four dimensions has an  anomaly-free discrete chiral symmetry
under which  is rotated by an  root of 1. A nonzero
expectation value of  breaks this symmetry, so it follows that
in any supersymmetric vacuum, the discrete chiral symmetry is
spontaneously broken.   If a supersymmetric vacuum exists in which
 for one choice of ,
then applying the broken symmetry gives additional vacua with the
other possible choices of . Hence supersymmetric vacua
must come in groups of , permuted by the spontaneously broken
discrete chiral symmetry.

Of course, it is believed that for any , the theory has
precisely  supersymmetric vacua, all with a mass gap, permuted
by the broken symmetry.  Unfortunately, no satisfactory
approximation is known for describing these vacua.

Results In The Present Paper 

In section 2 of this paper, we review the arguments given in
. In section 3, we extend the argument for , and in
section 4, we do so for .  In section 5, we briefly review
some pertinent aspects of the one-instanton calculations
-  .

Review 


 In this section, we briefly review the known arguments.

For the classical groups , ,Our notation for
symplectic groups is such that .  For classical
groups, we take the symbol  to refer to a trace in the
fundamental representation of , , or  (of
dimension , , and , respectively).  and , one can
prove directly ,  that the ring  is
generated by . In fact, for the classical groups,
any invariant polynomial in the 's is a polynomial in
the traces of words in  and .For , there
is an antisymmetric tensor of order , but because of
anticommutativity of  and , it cannot be used to make an
invariant polynomial in these variables if .  The groups
 with  are of course not simple, so we need not
consider them.  A typical trace of such a word is
W_1^n_1 W_2^n_2 W_1^n_3 W_2^n_s .  The
ideal  contains , so modulo , we can take 
and  to anticommute.  Hence the only traces to consider are
.  But  also contains
, and likewise
. So we are reduced to generators 
, . As 
for simple , it follows that  is generated for
 a classical Lie group by .

The conjecture under discussion asserts more precisely that 
 is generated by  with the relation .  So among
other things one would like to prove that  in
, or equivalently, that as an element of ,
.  In , denoting the rank of  as , the
weaker statement that  was proved. In fact, let 
, where  is the Lie algebra of a
maximal torus in , and  is its orthocomplement.  Let
 be the ideal generated by the matrix elements of the
projection of  to . Then , since
if  take values in , we have
.  To prove that , it
suffices to show that .  The projection of
 to  can be written 
, where the sum runs over an orthonormal basis
, , of . The  graded ring
 is freely generated by the odd elements ,
 (with no relations, that is, except
anticommutativity).  Moreover,  as an
element of .  This formula and the absence of relations
among the  make clear that  in ; indeed, 
.

For the Lie groups  and , one has . So for
these groups, the result  in  is
equivalent to the desired .  For other groups,
, and a direct algebraic proof that  is not
yet known.  It is possible to use four-dimensional instantons to
prove this result; an indication of how to do so is given in
section 5.

The remaining step in  was to complete the proof of the
conjecture for  by showing that  for this group.
(For , .)  In sketching the proof, and making similar
arguments for other groups, we will make the formulas less clumsy
by writing  and  for  and .In effect, we are
here picking a basis for the space of , .
This will obscure the  symmetry that was mentioned
in the introduction.  We regard  and  as 
traceless matrices, and construct the following  order
polynomial in : F^i_1i_2i_N (A)=^j_1j_2j_N A^i_1  _j_1 A^i_2  _j_2 A^i_N  _j_N .  Here
 is the completely antisymmetric
tensor, so the right hand side of  is antisymmetric in the
"lower" indices of the 's and hence (as the matrix elements
of  anticommute)  is completely symmetric in its indices
.  As we explain in a moment, 
 is contained in the ideal generated by matrix elements of
. Suppose that this is known. Define the dual function of
, G_i_1i_2i_N (B)=_k_1k_2k_N B^k_1  _i_1 B^k_2  _i_2 B^k_N  _i_N .  It is
likewise contained in the ideal generated by .  Since  and
 are both contained in the ideal , so is
F(A)G(B)=&F^i_1i_2i_N (A)G_i_1i_2i_N (B)=&^j_1j_2j_N A^i_1  _j_1 A^i_2  _j_2 A^i_N  _j_N _k_1k_2k_N B^k_1  _i_1 B^k_2  _i_2 B^k_N  _i_N .   But
a direct evaluation of the right hand side of  can be made
using the identity ^j_1j_2j_N _k_1k_2k_N =^j_1 _k_1 ^j_2 _k_2 ^j_N _k_N permutations of  k_1,k_2,k_N. 
When this is done, all indices of 's become contracted with
indices of 's, implying that   is a sum of
terms , with
various .  The coefficient of  is nonzero -
it is 1, coming from the trivial permutation in . The other
terms with some  are contained in , as we have seen in
proving that  is generated by . Hence .

So it remains only to show that  is in the
ideal generated by .  Without loss of generality, since this
tensor is symmetric in the indices , we can set these to a
common value, say .  We will show that
^j_1j_2j_N A^N _j_1 A^N _j_2 A^N _j_N   is a nonzero multiple of
^Nj_1j_2j_N-1  (A^2)^N _j_1 A^N _j_2 A^N _j_3 A^N _j_N-1  ,  which is certainly proportional to . We can
write  more explicitly as
_x=1 ^N^Nj_1j_2j_N-1  A^N _x
A^x _j_1 A^N _j_2 A^N _j_3 A^N _j_N-1  .  The
expression A^N _xA^N _j_2 A^N _j_3 A^N _j_N_1  ,  being antisymmetric in , is
a nonzero multiple of _xj_2j_3j_N-1 r ^rs_1s_2s_N-1  A^N _s_1 A^N _s_2 A^N _s_N-1  .  Now
substitute this expression in , and then use  to
write the product 
 as a multiple of
.   We learn
that  is a nonzero multiple of
(^N_x^j_1 _r-^N_r^j_1 _x)
A^x _j_1 ^rs_1s_2s_N-1  A^N _s_1 A^N _s_2 A^N _s_N-1  .  The
 terms give a multiple of , which vanishes
for  in the Lie algebra of , and the
 term gives , as promised.

Proof For  

In this section, we prove the conjecture for .  For this
group,  and .  Since we have in section 2
explained why  is generated by  for , and why
, we need only prove that .


We recall that a generator  of  can be represented as a
 symmetric tensor .  Indices are raised and
lowered using the invariant antisymmetric tensor  of
, and its inverse :
, , with
.  The definition of  is
. To think of  as a matrix that
can be multiplied, one should raise an index and use .
The ideal  is
generated by the matrix elements of , or explicitly by the
quantities _kl A_ik A_jl ^kl ,  as well as
similar expressions with one or both 's replaced by .


The antisymmetric tensor  is nondegenerate and has a nonzero
Pfaffian.  This implies that the antisymmetric tensor
 can be written in terms of
: ^i_1i_2i_2N  =^i_1i_2 ^i_3i_4 ^i_2N-1 i_2N   permutations . 

The strategy of the proof will be the same as for .  We
will construct a polynomial  which is contained in the ideal
generated by , and which when contracted with the analogous
polynomial in  is equal to  modulo . We simply set
F_i_1i_2i_N+1  ^k_1k_2k_N-1  (A)=^k_1k_2k_N-1 j_1j_2j_N+1  A_i_1j_1 A_i_2j_2 A_i_N+1 j_N+1  .   is
antisymmetric in the 's and symmetric in the 's.  To show
that  is contained in the ideal , we use the identity
 to express the tensor  as a sum of products of
 's.  The 's have a total of  indices,
 of which are  and are contracted with
's.  exceeds the number of 's, so
 in each term of the sum, at least one  has two
indices  that are contracted with 's.  Since a
 cannot be contracted twice with the same 
( as  is symmetric), the  in
question is contracted once each with two different 's, giving
, for some values of the
indices; this is a generator of . So .

After defining 
by the same formula, we now want to evaluate F(A)F(B)=F^i_1i_2i_N+1  _k_1k_2k_N-1  (A)F_i_1i_2i_N+1  ^k_1k_2k_N-1  (B).  (The
indices of  have been raised and lowered with 's to
make this contraction.)  Clearly,  is contained in
, since  and  are.  However, we can also evaluate
 by working directly from the definition:
F(A)F(B)=&_k_1k_2k_N-1 j_1j_2j_N+1  A^i_1j_1 A^i_2j_2 A^i_N+1 j_N+1  &^k_1k_2k_N-1 m_1m_2m_N+1  B_i_1m_1 B_i_2m_2 B_i_N+1 m_N+1  .   Now upon using the identity  to
evaluate 
, all
indices of 's are contracted with indices of 's, and we get
as in section 2 a sum of terms each of which is of the form
 for some
.  The coefficient of  is nonzero,
and the other terms with some  are again all contained in
the ideal .  So we have shown that  is contained in
, completing the proof of the conjecture for the symplectic
group.

Proof For  

For , the dual Coxeter number is .  The proof that
 will be similar to what we have already seen,
though slightly more elaborate.  A novelty for  is that
 in this case, so the argument using reduction to a maximal
torus (which only shows that ) does not suffice to
show that . The only proof of this that I know of
uses facts about four-dimensional instantons and is deferred to
section 5.

An element of the Lie algebra of  is an antisymmetric
 matrix ; indices are raised and lowered and contracted using the
invariant metric   and its inverse .
Since indices can be raised and lowered in a unique way without introducing
any minus signs, we make no distinction between upper and
lower indices. The ideal  is generated by
(A^2)_ij =_kA_ik A_kj =-_kA_ik A_jk ,  and
analogous expressions with one or both 's replaced by .
Apart from , the only independent invariant tensor is
the antisymmetric tensor .


Since the proof that  will be slightly elaborate, we
first consider the case of  (which is isomorphic to 
so that we could borrow the result of the last section, though the
argument will not be expressed in such terms).  To prove that
 for , we will construct a cubic polynomial ,
which is contained in  and when contracted with the analogous
cubic polynomial in  is equal to  mod . This will show
that  for .  Then we will generalize the
construction to  with .  (Since  is equivalent
to  and  to , we need not
consider those cases.)

To construct , we will begin with a product of three 's,
say , and a product of two antisymmetric
tensors,  .
Then we will contract all six indices of the 's with some of
the ten indices carried by the antisymmetric tensors.  There is
essentially only one way to do this.  We cannot take two 's and
contract all four of their indices with the same antisymmetric
tensor, since
A_i_1i_2 A_i_3i_4 _i_1i_2i_3i_4i_5 =0  by
anticommutativity.  Likewise, we cannot have two 's each with
one index contracted with each of the antisymmetric tensors, since
again
A_i_1j_1 A_i_2j_2 _i_1i_2i_3i_4i_5 _j_1j_2j_3j_4j_5 =0 
by anticommutativity. So the only nonzero expression that we can
make by contracting all six indices of the three 's with six of
the ten indices of the antisymmetric tensors is
F_i_1i_2j_1j_2 (A)=A_i_3i_4 A_j_3j_4 A_i_5j_5 
_i_1i_2i_3i_4i_5 _j_1j_2j_3j_4j_5 ,  in which
one  is contracted twice with the first antisymmetric tensor,
one is contracted twice with the second, and one is contracted
once with each.

If we insert in the definition of  the identity

, we get a sum of many terms
each proportional to a product of five metric tensors
.  The five metrics have a total of ten indices,
six of which are contracted with indices of the three 's.  The crucial fact
is that six exceeds five, so one metric has both indices contracted with 's.  One
cannot contract a metric tensor twice with the same 
(, as  is antisymmetric).  So inevitably,
in each term, one of the 's is contracted with two
different 's, giving an expression 
that is a generator of the ideal .  So  is contained in .

On the other hand, consider F(A)F(B)=A_i_3i_4 A_j_3j_4 A_i_5j_5 
_i_1i_2i_3i_4i_5 _j_1j_2j_3j_4j_5 
B_k_3k_4 B_t_3t_4 B_k_5t_5 
_i_1i_2k_3k_4k_5 _j_1j_2t_3t_4t_5 .  We can
evaluate this by using  to express the products
 and 
 in terms of
products of 's.  When we do this,  the indices of 's
and 's are contracted, and we get a sum of terms, each of which
is a product of traces of words in  and .  The sum includes
a positive multiple of , and additional terms that are
contained in  because the trace of any word with more than two
letters is in .  This proves that  for .

To prove in a similar fashion that  for , we
should start with  factors of  and contract some of their
indices with a product of two 's to define a polynomial
.  To prove along the above lines that , we need
to have at least  indices of the product of 's
contracted with 's.  Let us verify that this is just possible.
As we have seen above, three 's can be contracted twice each
with the product of 's, giving a total of 6
contractions. The remaining  's can each have only one
index contracted with the product of 's, since two
contractions will give a vanishing result by virtue of  or
 (which have obvious analogs for ).  The total number
of contractions will hence be , exactly what we need.
It does not matter with which antisymmetric tensor the last 
's are contracted.  So we define
F(A)&_i_1i_2j_1j_2j_N-3 s_1s_2s_N-5  &=_i_1i_2t_1t_2t_N-2  _j_1j_2j_N-3 k_1k_2k_3 A_t_1t_2 A_k_1k_2 A_t_3k_3 A_t_4s_1 A_t_5s_2 A_t_N-2 s_N-5  .    is contained in  for the
familiar reason: upon using  to replace the product of
antisymmetric tensors with a sum of products of 's, we get
a sum of terms in each of which some  is contracted with
two 's, giving a generator of .

Hence the quantity F(A)F(B)=F(A)_i_1i_2j_1j_2j_N-3 s_1s_2s_N-5  F(B)_i_1i_2j_1j_2j_N-3 s_1s_2s_N-5    is
contained in .  On the other hand, explicitly
F(A)F(B)=&_i_1i_2t_1t_2t_N-2  _j_1j_2j_N-3 k_1k_2k_3 A_t_1t_2 A_k_1k_2 A_t_3k_3 A_t_4s_1 A_t_5s_2 A_t_N-2 s_N-5  &_i_1i_2u_1u_2u_N-2  _j_1j_2j_N-3 n_1n_2n_3 B_u_1u_2 B_j_1j_2 B_u_3j_3 B_u_4s_1 B_u_5s_2 B_u_N-2 s_N-5  .   Using  to replace

 and likewise
    
 with sums of products of 's, we learn
in the familiar fashion that  is equal to
 plus a sum of terms (proportional to traces of longer
words in  and ) that are contained in .  Combining these
results, we deduce that .

Implications Of Instanton Calculations 

For any simple Lie group , a one-instanton solution on 
 is obtained by picking a minimal  subgroup of ,
and embedding in  the one-instanton solution of .  Under
such a minimal , the Lie algebra  of 
decomposes as the adjoint representation of  plus a certain
number of pairs of copies of the spin one-half representation, as
well as  singlets. Because the same  representations
arise for any , the relevant properties of the one-instanton
computation are largely independent of .  A computation for all
simple Lie groups was performed in N. M. Davies, T. J.
Hollowood, and V. V. Khoze, "Monopoles, Affine Algebras, and The
Gluino Condensate," hep-th/0006011. .

For instanton number one, the instanton moduli are the position
and size and " orientation" of the instanton and the
choice of minimal embedding of  in .


In the field of the instanton, the gluino field (which is a fermi
field with values in the adjoint representation of ) has 
zero modes, all of one chirality.  This is the right number to
give an expectation value to an operator with the quantum numbers
of a product of  copies of .  In , general
properties of chiral operators were used to show that in a
supersymmetric vacuum the expectation value of a product of chiral
operators such as   is
independent of the choice of points  as long as
the  are distinct, ensuring there are no ambiguities in
defining the operator products.  Moreover, a one-instanton
computation was performed on , with the result
S(x_1)S(x_2)S(x_h)_1 inst  =c_0e^-I   for some constant ; here  is the
instanton action.  The computation is made by evaluating 
as bilinear expressions in the fermion zero modes (corrections to
this vanish by holomorphy) and then integrating over instanton
moduli space. The subscript "" in  refers
to the fact that we are recording here the result of a
one-instanton computation, which may or may not give the exact
quantum answer.

Our main goal in the present section is to argue from properties
of the one-instanton moduli space that .  For
this, we do not need to know whether the one-instanton computation
gives the exact quantum answer or not; in fact, we do not even
need to know if the quantum theory really exists.  The argument we
will give could be formulated as a conventional mathematical proof
that , using properties of instanton moduli
space.

We will also sketch how instantons are used to deduce the quantum
anomaly that makes  a non-zero multiple of the identity  in
the quantum chiral ring (rather than vanishing, as it does
classically). For this, one does need to know something about the
quantum theory, so after arguing that , we will
recall some issues concerning the relation of the instanton
computation to the quantum theory.

It is possible to take  of the  to coincide without
running into any difficulty or ambiguity and in particular without
running into a singular contribution from small instantons.  (See
eqn. (7.17) of , where this choice is made.) So 
S(x)S^h-1 (y)_1 inst  =c_0e^-I .  From this
we can deduce the desired result that . Indeed,
because of the -invariance of the one-instanton
computation, a formula 
 would imply the vanishing of
 (it would lead to a representation of  as the
integral of a total derivative over instanton moduli space). Since
it does not vanish, .

This completes what we have to say about nonvanishing of 
in the classical theory. Now let us discuss how the quantum
anomaly in  comes about. If we simply set  in , we
find that the function that must be integrated over instanton
moduli space is identically zero.  The reason for this is that at
each point  and for any given one-instanton
solution, two of the fermion zero modes vanish.  (They are a
suitable linear combination, depending on  and on the position
of the instanton, of the zero modes generated by global
supersymmetries and superconformal transformations.)  Hence, when
 is evaluated using the fermion zero modes, one gets
identically zero before doing any integral over instanton moduli
space.  This is compatible with (but stronger than) the kind of
behavior of  that one would expect from the classical result
 (this result would make us expect a perhaps not
identically zero total derivative on moduli space).

In the quantum theory, however, we should be careful in defining
an operator product such as .  This is conveniently done by
point-splitting, taking a product such 
and, after performing the computation, taking the limit as the
 coincide.  In the present case, there is no problem in
setting  of the  equal (since no singular
small-instanton contributions appear in  as long as 
).  But we should be careful to define  as 
.  When we do this, clearly we get 
S^h(y)_1 inst  =c_0e^-I . 

If we assume that the one-instanton amplitude coincides with the
exact quantum answer, we would deduce from this that the classical
ring relation  is deformed quantum mechanically to
.  However, it is believed that the exact quantum
answer is actually S^h(y)-I ,  with a
different  constant , so that the quantum ring relation is
really .  The reason for the discrepancy between the
one-instanton computation of the anomaly coefficient and the exact
result is still somewhat surprising; for a detailed analysis and
references, see section 7 of .  One simple statement

on  instead of , with an
arbitrary radius  for the , one gets the result ,
with what is believed to be the correct coefficient ,
independent of the radius (as long as the radius is finite). Since
the statement 
is an operator statement, independent of any particular choice of
state, the coefficient  can be computed, in principle, on any
chosen four-manifold and with any chosen boundary conditions.
Compactification on  with small radius and a
non-trivial Wilson loop expectation value at infinity gives a
suitable  framework for a reliable computation of the anomaly
coefficient in a weakly coupled context.  (The proof that
 could also have been carried out in just the
same way after compactification on .)  The direct
computation on  is presumably affected by some infrared
divergences in the relation between the perturbative vacuum in
which the computation is done and the true quantum vacuum.
