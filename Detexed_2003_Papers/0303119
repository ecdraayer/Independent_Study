necessity of a metric tensor, which is a covariant representation
of the gauge group in order to set up a consistent second order

Introduction 

Unification of noncommutative geometry with gravity theories is a
very challenging goal for a theoretical physicist
-. Till now only gauge theories are proved to be
consistent after deforming the ordinary product of fields into a
noncommutative star product.

Gravity theories are usually constructed by requiring either
diffeomorphism invariance or local Lorentz invariance. Since the
Moyal star product breaks global Lorentz invariance in gauge
theories, it also breaks diffeomorphism invariance in a gravity
theory. Therefore in the noncommutative case it is possible to
preserve only local Lorentz invariance, with the gauge group
extended to  instead of , in order that the
gauge transformations multiplied with the star product are closed
between them.

This approach has still many problems, mainly because the metric
becomes complex, and the antisymmetric part of the metric may have
nonphysical propagating modes-. It is however
worth to explore all the consequences that such a new theory can
give, before taking an opinion about it. In this paper we attempt
to give a more solid construction of noncommutative gravity theory
by introducing a new matrix model based on the 
group ( for Euclidean gravity ) or  for the
 case.

In this respect the first-order formalism, based on the vierbein
and spin connection, turns out to be superior to the second order
formalism, since it permits the definition of a matrix model,
without the necessity of inverting the metric, which would be a
rather difficult obstacle.

The vierbein is encoded in a matrix , having values in the
coset space , while the spin
connection is encoded in a matrix , having values in the
gauge group . The action is a -form, thus
preventing the use of any metric, and the corresponding equations
of motion are proved to be a natural generalization of the
Einstein equations, provided a certain separation between odd
powers in  and even powers in  is made ( as done
in Ref. and Ref. ).

We confirm the necessity of a complex metric tensor, but we point
out a property which was not discussed before, i.e. the metric
tensor cannot be defined to be invariant under local Lorentz
invariance, but at most it can be a covariant representation of
the gauge group. We believe that the introduction of a multiplet
of metric tensors is necessary to set up a consistent second order
formalism. Each component of this multiplet has no direct physical
meaning, since it can be mixed with the other components by a
gauge redefinition of the vierbein and spin connection.

In the last part of the article, we attack the problem of defining
noncommutative gravitational instantons-. In
this sense, our formalism based on the Matrix model approach turns
out to be fruitful, since then the finite action solutions of the
equations of motion are generated by quasi-unitary operators, as
it has been successfully found in the Yang-Mills case
-. The ultimate source of our quasi-unitary
operator is a projector, with values in 
. We find that if the projector is restricted to
be pure left or pure right, then the corresponding spin connection
is self-dual or anti-self-dual, an important property which can
make the bridge between our definition of gravitational instantons
and the classical standard definition. However our class of
solutions is more general than only self-dual ones. We finally
outline how to construct examples of quasi-unitary operators
giving rise to their sources, the  projectors.
An important tool to construct these examples is the use of
duality in noncommutative theory-.




Matrix model for noncommutative gravity 

We are going to introduce a gravity theory on a noncommutative
plane defined by the commutators:

[ x _i, x _j ] = i _ij          
det _ij  0 . We remember that instead of using the commutation relations in
full generality, it is possible to reduce them in a diagonal form
as follows

 
which is basically solved by two types of raising and lowering
oscillator operators.

With the experience in the Yang-Mills case, we attack
the problem of noncommutative gravity. Our proposal is based on
gauging the local Lorentz symmetry, extended to 
 for consistency.

Firstly we define two types of matrices , , where
 is, at least in the Euclidean case, a hermitian matrix
with values in the group , while  is a
hermitian matrix with values in the coset space 
. Then we write the Einstein action for the
noncommutative case as

 

This action can be derived as a part of a more symmetric action (
inspired by Ref. and Ref. ),  based on two
 fields 

X_^  = X_Y_,  given by the sum of two similar contributions:

 

With the trick of adding the second term, the odd powers in
 all vanish and we are left with three terms; the term with
zero powers of  is a pure topological term, representing
noncommutative topological gravity, the term with two powers of
 reproduces the action () which is the starting
point of our article, and a term proportional to the square of the
torsion , defined as

T_  = [ X_, Y_] - [ X_, Y_], while the term with four powers of  gives rise to the
cosmological constant term.

Being the dependence from the torsion  quadratic, it
is possible to set it equal to zero, because the variation of the
other terms are consistent with this choice.

Neglecting the topological term and the cosmological constant term
we can continue to discuss the action () as the basis for
noncommutative gravity.

In this paper we mainly discuss the  and  cases for
simplicity, since we are mainly interested to introduce the
noncommutative version of gravitational instantons, and we need to
work with the Euclidean case. In the Euclidean case , the
gamma matrices satisfy the hermitian condition

^ _a = _a        
_5^  = _5 . The matrix  can be developed in terms of basic 
valued matrices :

Y_= e^a__a + i f^a__a _5 .
 The hermitian condition of the  is reflected on a hermitian
condition on the component vierbeins as follows:

 

It is possible to define left and right combinations of the
vierbeins as follows:

e^a _  = e^a_i f^a_     ( e^+
a _)^  = e^- a _,  which are related by hermitian conjugation. These matrices have
the nice property to be closed under the  gauge
transformations. In fact a left-right decomposition can be made at
the level of the  defining

 

In terms of  the action can be rewritten as

S_E = - _E  Tr [ ^  (
Y_ ^+  Y_ ^-  + Y_ ^-  Y_ ^+ ) ( [ X_,
X_] - i ^-1 _  ) ] .  Note that since , it is not possible to
define an action containing only left combinations of the
vierbein, but both left and right vierbeins are required to make
 hermitian.

The matrix  can be developed in terms of the basic
matrices:

X_= p _+ _^1 + _^5 ^5 +
i _ ^ab  _ab         _ab  = [ _a, _b ] ,  where the component matrices are all hermitian by construction:
p _^  = p _    _^1 
  = _^1      _^5    =
_^5        _ ^ab    =
_ ^ab  .  We have introduced the distinction between  and
 since in a matrix model for noncommutative
gravity it is necessary to separate the background from the
fluctuations. In general, the background for the matrix
model of noncommutative gravity will be defined as

 

and the fluctuations are generated by the matrices

_^1,  _^5,  ^ab _,  e^a_-
^a_,  f^a_.  The background is chosen to satisfy the equations of motion of the
matrix model and to introduce the noncommutative coordinates as
noncommutative analogues of the concepts of derivatives of the
fields, as we normally do in the Yang-Mills case. Therefore the
commutation relation , for example, of the background
 with the matrix  is equivalent, at a
level of the corresponding symbol, to a derivative action:

[ p _, _^1 ] __^1 .  Moreover the operator products are transformed into star products
of the corresponding symbols ( through the Weyl map, see Ref.
 for details ).

In general, the matrix model is built on the gauge invariance

 

where  is the gauge transformation of ;
these types of transformations reproduce, in the commutative
limit, the standard local Lorentz transformations for the vierbein
and the spin connection. The gauge transformations of 
 are defined from the generators 
 and obey the unitary condition:

U^  U = U U^  = 1 .  Therefore introducing the anti-hermitian matrix 

U = [ ]      ^  = -   can be developed in terms of basic gauge parameters:

= i _0 + i _5 _5 + ^ab 
_ab  ,  where the component parameters are all hermitian matrices:

_0^  = _0      _5^ 
= _5       ^ab    = ^ab  .
 What does it change in the  scenario ? The action is
always the same () with 
 ( see Appendix ). The matrix  is a
matrix with values in the coset space 
, and the matrix  has values in 
.

To define the hermitian conjugation of these matrices, let us
recall that  is the hermitian
conjugation matrix for the gamma matrices in the  case:

 

Then we define the hermitian conjugation for the matrices 
 as

 

Again  can be developed in terms of the basic components as
follows:

 

and 

X_= p _+ _^1 + _^5 _5 +
i _ ^ab  _ab  ,  where all the components are hermitian.

In general the  matrix model is built on the gauge
invariance

 

where  is a gauge transformation of .
The gauge transformations of this group are again defined from the
generators  and obey the condition

 

This reality condition assures that the matrix , once that
it is gauge transformed, respects again the hermitian condition
().

By defining  it follows that

^  = _0 _0 . The matrix  can be developed in terms of the basic
parameters:

= i _0 + i _5 _5 + ^ab 
_ab   with all hermitian components.

Finally let us discuss the decomposition in 
and  of the Euclidean 
gauge transformations. This decomposition is obtained by requiring
that the generators of  are given by

( 1, _ab  ) ( 1 + _5 2  ).
 The application of the projector operator 
on  reduces the number of generators from six to
three. To see this property in detail we recall the identity:

_5 _ab  = - _abcd  _cd .
 Therefore the generators of  read

M_ab  = [ _ab  - _abcd 
_cd  ] . Since  is
anti-self-dual, the only independent generators are three

M_0i  = [ _0i  - _ijk 
_jk  ] = - i (   ) .  Analogously the generators of  are given by

( 1, _ab  ) ( 1 - _5 2  ) ,
 where

N_ab  = 1-_5 2  _ab  = [
_ab  + _abcd  _cd  ]  is self-dual

N_ab  = _abcd  N_cd  .  Therefore the only independent generators are

N_0i  = [ _oi  + _ijk 
_jk  ] = i (   ) .  What happens in the  case ?

The generators of  are given by

( 1, _ab  ) 1+ _5 2  ,  where now the identity  () reads 
.

One can always define the generators of  and
 as

 

where now for 

 

and for 

 

Let us define the chiral decomposition of the gauge transformation
as

U = 1+_5 2  U_L + 1-_5 2  U_R .
 The left part  must obey the hermitian condition

 

Therefore reducing eq. () to the upper 
subspace, we find

U^ _L _1 U_L = _1  and analogously for 

U^ _R _1 U_R = _1 ,  which are completely equivalent to the usual  condition

U^  _3 U = _3 .  By defining

U_L,R  = [ _L,R  ]      
^ _L,R  = -_1 _L,R  _1 ,
 it follows that  can be expanded  as

= i _0 + i _1 _1 + _2
_2 + _3 _3 ,  where all the components are hermitian.

Equations of motions 

Let us discuss the equations of motion of the matrix model. Since
there are two independent matrices, we need to vary the action
with respect to  and  independently,
therefore obtaining two types of equations of motion.

The first one is due to the variation with respect to 


S = Tr [ _5 Y_Y_( X_X_+ X_X_) ^  ]
 that is vanishing if the following tensor is null

T_  = [ X_, Y_] - [ X_, Y_] = 0
i.e. it is equivalent to the condition of null torsion.

The other equation of motion is obtained by varying with respect
to 

S = Tr [ _5 ^  ( Y_Y_+ Y_Y_) R_  ] where

R_  = [ X_, X_] - i _ ^-1 
 and it is vanishing if the following condition is met

^   Y_, R_   = 0 .
 The two equations of motion () and () are not
completely independent, since it exists, at the noncommutative
level, an identity similar to the covariant conservation of the
tensor 

D_G^  = 0        G^  = R^ _E -
g^  R_E  where we have distinguished , the Einstein Ricci
tensor, from the antisymmetric matric  introduced
before.

In fact, let us evaluate

^  [ X_,  Y_, R_ 
 ] = 0 . We will prove that it corresponds to a trivial identity. It is
enough to observe that () can be decomposed into a sum of
terms which are zero

^  [ X_, Y_] = 0 because of the null torsion condition, and

^  [ X_, R_  ] = 0
 because of the Jacobi identity.

Let us write the equations of motion () and () in
components, to recognize the usual form of the Einstein equations
in the commutative limit.

By introducing the parameterizations () and () of
the Euclidean case we find that  is equivalent to

 

Therefore it is not possible to make the two vierbeins 
and  proportional, because of the term proportional to
 and .

These two equations relate all the components of the spin
connection  in terms
of the generic vierbeins (), treating them
independently.

To help intuition, it is possible to restrict the general
equations of motion () such that the symbol corresponding
to the first operator equation contains only even powers of
, while the symbol corresponding to the second equation
contains only odd powers of  ( we refer to Ref.for a detailed discussion on this point ).

This reduction requires that the symbols of the operators
 have an expansion in  with only
even powers, while the symbols of the operators 
 have only odd powers. In this
scenario, the usual free torsion condition for  is
recovered in the commutative limit since

[ ^1_, e^a_]  ^5_, f^a_
[ ^bc _, f^a_] O ( ^2 ) ,
 taking into account that the commutator of operators,
corresponding to the antisymmetric part of the star product, gives
another odd contribution to the powers of , while the
anticommutator is even.

Let us analyze in the same scenario the other equation of motion
() which should give rise to the usual Einstein equations.
Firstly let us compute the components of  as follows

 

Following the same reasoning done for the vierbein ( from now on
the distinction between odd and even powers of  is always
intended true for the symbols of the corresponding operators ), it
is possible to restrict  such that 
 contain only odd powers of , while
 contains only even powers of , and
therefore in the commutative limit only 
survives.

Then we are ready to compute the equations of motion ():

 

Again it is not possible to make the two vierbeins proportional
because of the odd terms  and .

While the first equation of () can be restricted to odd
powers of , the second one can contain only even powers of
. Since

 f^a_, R^1_   [ e^a_,
R^5_  ] [ f^b_, R^ba _  ] O(^2)  the only surviving term in the commutative limit is

^  _abcd   e^d_,
R^bc _   = 0  which is in fact completely equivalent to the usual Einstein
equations, where

R^bc _  _^bc _-
_^bc _+ 2  ^cd _  ,
^db _   - 2  ^bd _  ,
^dc _    is the usual antisymmetric classical tensor.

Gauge transformations of  and   

Before analyzing the gauge transformations of  and ,
we recall that the distinction between odd and even powers of
 must be made also at a level of the gauge group 
, to be consistent.

Recalling the results of Ref., it is possible to reduce
the gauge symmetry from  to , where
the gauge parameter 

U = [ ]        = i _0 + i
_5 ^5 + ^ab  _ab   has the following property, i.e.  contains
only odd powers of , while  contains only
even powers of . This is a group property in the sense
that the commutator of two gauge parameters has the same
distinction.

We are now ready to analyze the gauge transformations of 
and . The vierbein  transforms under 
 following the law

Y_U^  Y_U .  At an infinitesimal level, it transforms as

Y_= [ Y_, ] .  By introducing the decomposition of  and  in terms
of basic components we find

 

A rapid check shows that the first equation can be reduced to
contain, in the case of  transformations, only even
powers of , while the second equation only odd powers of
, taking always into account the additional odd
contribution coming from the commutator of two operators.

In the commutative limit, since the terms

[ e^a_, _0 ]  f^a_, _5  _abcd  [ f^d_, ^bc  ] O( ^2 ),
 the usual transformation of the vierbein under local Lorentz
transformations is recovered

e^a_= 2  e^b_, ^ba   . The vierbein transformations are diagonal at a level of the
combination , as already anticipated

e^a _= i [ e^a  _, _0 ] + 2 
e^b _, ^ba   i  e^a _, _5
 i _abcd  [ e^d  _, ^bc  ] .
 Analogously the spin connection transforms under 
 according to the law

X_U^  X_U  and at an infinitesimal level

X_= [ X_, ] .  In components this equation reads

 

The same considerations made for the vierbein apply here, i.e. the
spin connections  and ,  restricted to
odd powers of , and  restricted to even
powers of , maintain this property if the gauge parameters
belong to .

In the classical limit we notice that the only terms which survive
are all the expected ones:

_^ab  = - i [ p _, ^ab  ] +
2  _^ac , ^cb   - 2  _^bc ,
^ca   .  These properties can also be made more clear and transparent by
using the chiral decomposition for :

X_= X_^L ( 1+_5 2 ) + X_^R
( 1-_5 2 )  where

X_^L = p _+ ( ^1_+ ^5_) + i
^ab __ab  ( 1+_5 2 ).
 By using the property

_ab  ( 1+_5 2  ) = [
_ab  - _abcd  _cd  ]  the  part can be simplified to

 

It is not difficult to show that  is
an anti-self-dual gauge connection:

 

Analogously  is made by a self-dual gauge connection:

 

Reducing the gauge group to a pure left part by taking:

U = U_L ( 1+_5 2  ) +  (
1-_5 2  )         U_R = 1 then only the left part of the spin connection changes according
to

 

The implications of this observation are interesting, since
applying a pure left unitary transformation to the background
connection  one constructs a ( pure gauge )
anti-self-dual spin connection, while  remains pure
background.

Decomposing the gauge parameter  into chiral components
leads to:

= ^L ( 1+_5 2  ) +
^R ( 1-_5 2  )  where

 

Defining ,
,  can be
rewritten as:

X^L_= p _+ _^L + i
 _ ^ab  _ab  ( 1+_5 2 
)  and the gauge property of  now reads:

 

In the classical limit the anti-self-dual spin connection
 transforms under the anti-self-dual
gauge parameter .




Definition of the metric 

It has been already pointed out in the literature that the metric
is given by the star product of two vierbeins and it is no more
symmetric, but these observations are not conclusive in my
opinion. There is one more difficulty to set up a consistent
second order formalism for noncommutative gravity, i.e. that the
metric tensor is not even invariant under the gauge group 
, on which the model is defined.

The only way out to this further obstacle is to allow for a more
general definition of metric, as a bilinear combination of the
vierbein which is at least covariant under ,
i.e. a representation of the basic gauge group of the theory.

We have in fact at disposition the bilinear form

Y_Y_= G_  + i B_       G_  =
 Y_, Y_     B_  = - i 2  [
Y_, Y_]  which transforms in a covariant way under ,
having the same transformation properties of the spin connection
 ( apart from the presence of two world indices instead of
one ).

Decomposing () into chiral parts one finds:

Y_Y_= Y^+ _Y^- _( 1-_5 2 
) + Y^- _Y^+ _( 1+_5 2  ).
 Therefore we conclude that it is not possible to define a
covariant metric tensor with only one vierbein , but
it is necessary the presence of both vierbeins.

Expanding the bilinear form () into components one finds:

Y_Y_= Y_ ^0 + Y_ ^5 _5  +
Y_ ^ab  _ab   with

 

where the symbols between parenthesis [  ] mean that we must take
the antisymmetric combination of the indices.

The tensor  is  symmetric and hermitian and its
components are given by


 

The  and  parts can be restricted to
contain only even powers of , while 
contains only odd powers of , and since obviously

g_ ^5 O(^2)  the only part which survives the commutative limit is

g^0_  =  e^a_, e^b_ _ab  .
 Under a gauge transformation,  transforms as

G_  U^  G_  U or at an infinitesimal level

G_  = [ G_ , ] .  In components one finds

 

It is clear that , therefore
one reobtains that  is gauge invariant in the
classical limit.

For the antisymmetric and hermitian part  one finds
analogous gauge transformations properties, and in this case the
components ,  can be restricted to
contain only odd powers of , while  only
even powers of . In the classical limit there is one term
which survives

B_ ^ab  = - i 4  (  e^a_, e^b_ - (
a b ) )  and it transforms in a covariant way as we can see from the
formula (). This antisymmetric part however decouples
from the Einstein equations, and it can be neglected.

In conclusion, in order to setup a consistent second order
formalism we believe that it is necessary to include all these
components into the game. Some results contained inconfirm indirectly this picture.

Gravitational instantons 

Given a solution of the equations of motion () and
(), it is possible to generate another one which is not
trivially connected to the first one by introducing a
quasi-unitary operator, which in the case of 
is of the type

 

where  is a projector with values in .

In particular we can start from the vacuum, which is defined by
the background of the matrix model:

 

and compute the following transformations

 

These are automatically solutions to the equations of motion of
the matrix model () and (), due to the property 
, and give a finite contribution to the matrix
model action since then:

[ X_, X_] - i ^-1 _  = i
^-1 _  P_0  this commutator is a projector, and the trace defining the action
is projected on a finite number of states. We call this generic
solution a noncommutative gravitational instanton.

Obviously one can introduce more structure into the game, by
requiring that the noncommutative solutions have a smooth
-limit and coincide in the commutative limit with some
known and classified solution-. It is not the
purpose of the present paper, however we believe that our
definition can be adjusted to achieve all these goals. For the
moment we limit ourself to indicate some general property of our
finite action solutions of the equations of motion.

Firstly the projector  can be decomposed into chiral parts

P_0 = P_0^L ( 1+_5 2  ) + P_0^R
( 1-_5 2  )  where  and  are two independent -valued
projectors. Let us note that in the particular case in which one
of these two projectors is null, the corresponding quasi-unitary
operator is of the form:

U = U_L ( 1+_5 2  ) +  (
1-_5 2  )     or      U =  (
1+_5 2  ) + U_R ( 1-_5 2 
)  and it produces a nontrivial spin connection only for the left or
right sector:

X_= U^ _L p _U_L (
1+_5 2  ) + p _(
1-_5 2  )  or

X_=  p _( 1+_5 2  ) +
U^ _R p _U_R ( 1-_5 2  )
.  The corresponding spin connection is automatically anti-self-dual
or self-dual, according to the choice  or 
.

Therefore solutions with self-dual or anti-self-dual spin
connections are naturally implemented, although the class of
solution defined by () is more general.

What is the generic form of the projector  with values in
 ? We don't have the general proof but we
believe that the more general solution is of the form

P_0^L = P_0^+  ( 1+_3 2  ) + P_0^- 
( 1-_3 2  )  where  are two independent projectors of , apart
from eventual isomorphisms of the Hilbert space, which are
implemented by unitary transformations of the type

P_0 U^  P_0 U        U^  U
= U U^  = 1 .  We can therefore reduce the general problem of projectors with
values in  to the  case.

This is also clear from the duality between  and 
gauge groups on the noncommutative plane which can be described as
follows.

Consider the Hilbert space created by the commutation rules of the
coordinates and label it with a quantum number . The
correspondence between  and  is obtained by, firstly
enlarging the one-oscillator basis to the  basis

n; a>  n N   a = 0,1  and noting the isomorphism between Hilbert spaces:

H   H        n: a >  2n+a >      a = 0,1  . Therefore we can relabel the tensorial product of the Hilbert
space of one oscillator and the gauge group  with a new
quantum number  that describes only oscillator states
with  gauge group.

Once that the general  projector is reduced to
a  projector, we need to build quasi-unitary operators with
gauge group  in four dimensions.

In four dimensions the Hilbert space on which the quasi-unitary
operator acts is ( see Ref. ) generally the tensorial
product of two Hilbert spaces of one oscillator

H  H      n_1,n_2>    n_1,
n_2 N .  We can therefore introduce a duality between four dimensions and
two dimensions, by observing that a couple of numbers can be made
isomorphic to a number, for example

(n_1, n_2) (n_1+n_2)(n_1+n_2+1) 2  + n_2 
      H  H  H 
 and therefore we can relabel the Hilbert space with only one
quantum number.

Explicitly the construction of a general class of quasi-unitary
operators with values in  in four dimensions follows these
steps. Let us define two new quantum numbers

n = n_1 + n_2      k= n_2  and let us introduce a short notation for the state:

 n_1, n_2 >  n(n+1) 2  + k > =  n; k > .
 A basis of the two-dimensional Hilbert space is determined by the
states

n;k>     0 k n     n N .
 We must allow the continuation of the notation () to
states with  keeping in mind the following equivalence
relation:

n;k > =  n+1; k-n-1 > .  In the two-dimensional basis, the generic finite projector
operator  can be represented in the following form, apart
from an isomorphism of the Hilbert space,

P_0 = _i=0 ^m-1  i ><i  that represents a configuration with instanton number .

In the two-dimensional basis it is easy to derive the
quasi-unitary operator  that produces the projector operator
:

 

To derive the quasi-unitary operator in the equivalent basis
 we must pullback the duality from the
four-dimensional plane and the two-dimensional one. The problem is
complicated in general, and it is simple to perform it only in the
simplest case, with a configuration with instanton number .
Then the quasi-unitary operator can be reexpressed as:

 

In summary, the construction of gravitational instantons can be
derived as in the Yang-Mills case by introducing quasi-unitary
operators with values in . Self-dual or
anti-self-dual solutions can be achieved restricting the gauge
group to its left part or right part only, being the general
solution defined by eqs. () without any particular
symmetry. The question of the smoothness of the classical limit
remains to be investigated, as well as the ( noncommutative )
characterization of these solutions in terms of topological
invariants.

Conclusions 

In this paper we have attempted to define noncommutative gravity
theory with a Matrix model approach. The noncommutative plane is
taken as a background solution of the Matrix model, and the
fluctuations are the vierbein and spin connections.

Two types of vierbein are needed to make the formalism consistent
at the noncommutative level. It is not possible to make them
proportional, but it is possible to restrict the equations of
motion in such a way that one type of vierbein has only even
powers of , and the other one only odd powers of ,
recovering in the classical limit the usual gravity theory with
only one vierbein.

The spin connection has other two  parts, which however can
be restricted to contain only odd powers of  and therefore
are negligible in the  limit.

These properties can be respected by gauge transformations, if the
gauge parameters are restricted to the , the smallest
subgroup of  , consistent with the star
product. The distinction between odd and even powers of 
is fruitful also in the discussion of the 
limit of the equations of motion, in which we recover the Einstein
equations.

We have then attacked the problem of defining a consistent second
order formalism. The metric tensor which is bilinear in the
vierbein cannot be defined to be invariant under 
 or even  in the noncommutative case, but only
covariant. The need of a multiplet of metric tensors, each one
having no direct physical meaning, is confirmed indirectly by the
computations of ref..

Finally we have attempted to give a definition of noncommutative
gravitational instantons. We have introduced 
valued quasi-unitary operators which generate, once that are
applied to the background, nontrivial solutions of the equations
of motion.

In the case of a pure left or right quasi-unitary operators, the
corresponding solution has a self-dual or anti-self-dual spin
connection, a property which defines the commutative gravitational
instantons. Our class of finite action solutions is more general.
We have then constructed explicit examples of quasi-unitary
operators based on the concept of duality of Hilbert spaces, which
is typical of the noncommutative plane.

Finally let us briefly mention the problems left; firstly the
construction of a consistent second-order formalism, with the use
of the multiplet of metric tensors outlined in this paper,
secondly the careful analysis of the physical degrees of freedom
of the metric tensor, and the cancellation of the unphysical ones
and thirdly a more careful analysis of the noncommutative
gravitational instantons and of their link with the commutative
case. The last project will require to take control of the 
 limit of the nonperturbative solutions constructed
in this article, and the introduction of topological invariants
for the noncommutative case. In any case we believe that the
language of matrices, introduced in this paper, which is more
familiar to a physicist than the star product formalism, will help
in making progress in this research field.

Appendix 

The gamma matrices are known to generate the  and 
algebra. In this appendix we recall some basic properties, like
the basic representations and commutation properties which are
used during this paper.

Firstly we repeat the  ( Euclidean ) case. We must solve the
anticommutation relations

 _a, _b  = 2 _ab   with the constraints . The solution
 to this requirements is (  the so-called chiral representation )

 _0 = (   )       _i = (   )   where  are the Pauli matrices. The properties

 ^2_5 = 1     ^ _5 = _5   identify  as the combination

 _5 = _0 _1 _2 _3      
 _5 = (  
 ) .   In the case of , we have to solve the anticommutation
 relations:

  _a, _b  = 2 _ab        ( + + - -
 )   with the constraints

 ^ _0 = _0    ^ _1 = _1   
 ^ _2 = - _2   ^ _3 = -
 _3.
   A possible choice is , in the chiral representation

 _0 = (   )   
_1 = (   )   
_2 = (   )    _3 =
(  ) .   Again  identified with the properties () can be chosen
 as in the Euclidean case ().

 The hermitian conjugation property can be encoded in the
 following property

 _a^  = _0 _a _0   where .

 The composition properties of gamma matrices can be summarized as
 follows:

  

 where we raise the indices with the tensor . Of course
 in the Euclidean case the distinction between upper and lower
 indices is superfluous.
