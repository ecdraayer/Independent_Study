 We present an explicit relation between representations of the
 Virasoro algebra and polynomial martingales in stochastic Loewner
 evolutions (SLE). We show that the Virasoro algebra is the
 spectrum generating algebra of SLE martingales. This is based on a
 new representation of the Virasoro algebra, inspired by the
 Borel-Weil construction, acting on functions
 depending on coordinates parametrizing conformal maps.

Fractal critical clusters are the cornerstones of criticality,
especially in two dimensions, see eg
refs..  Stochastic Loewner evolutions
 are random processes adapted to a
probabilistic description of such fractals.
The aim of this Letter is to elaborate on the connection between 
stochastic Loewner evolutions (SLE) and conformal field theories (CFT) developed
in ref.. We shall construct new representations of the Virasoro
algebra which allow us to show explicitely that the Virasoro algebra
is the generating algebra of (polynomial) martingales for the SLE
processes. Physically, martingales are observables conserved in mean.
They are essential ingredients for estimating probability of events.
Another approach for connecting SLE to representations of the Virasoro 
algebra has been described in.

Basic definitions of the stochastic Loewner evolutions and of their
martingales are recalled in the two first sections. The new
representations of the Virasoro algebra we shall construct are
described in sections 3 and 4. They are based on a generalization of
the Borel-Weil construction, which we apply to the Virasoro algebra.
They lead to expressions of the Virasoro generators as first order
differential operators acting on (polynomial) functions depending on 
an infinite set of coordinates parametrizing (germs of) conformal maps.
Although motivated by SLE considerations, this is a result independent
of SLE which may find other applications in CFT, string theories or
connected subjects. The applications to SLE are
presented in sections 5 and 6. In particular, we show
that all polynomial SLE martingales are in the Virasoro orbit obtained
by acting with these Virasoro generators on the constant function. 
Because it deals with polynomial martingales and well defined Virasoro
generators, this construction gives a precise algebraic meaning 
to the statement that CFT gives all SLE martingales.
It is more algebraic but less geometric.

1- SLE basics. 
Stochastic Loewner evolutions are growth processes 
defined via conformal maps which are solutions of Loewner's equation:



with  real. The map  is the
uniformizing map for a simply connected domain  of the upper half
plane , . The map  is normalized by
 at infinity. For fixed , it is well-defined up to
the time  for which .  
The sets  form
an increasing sequence,  for , 
and are called the hulls. The
domain  is .
The  processes are defined by choosing 
 with  a normalized Brownian
motion and  a real positive parameter so that 
.
In particular,  are  white-noise variables: 
.
Here and in the following,  
 denotes expectation value.
It will be convenient to introduce the function 
 whose Ito derivative is:
d _t(z) = 2 _t(z) dt - d _t 
The  equation () may be turned 
into a hierarchy of differential equations for the
coefficients of the expansion of  at infinity. Writing 

with , , and defining polynomials  
in the variables  by ,  and
 for , so that
,
the Loewner equation () becomes:
a _j=2 p_j(a_1,) ,j 2.  
Since  is a Brownian motion, with continuous
trajectories, eqs.() form a set of stochastic
differential equations for the 's, , and the solutions are
continuously differentiable functions of  which vanish at  due
to the initial condition . Thus, the Ito differential of any
 (polynomial, say) function  is



In particular, 

where the opertator  is the coefficient of  in the
previous formula : 
A= 2 ^2 a_1  ^2 +2_j
  2 p_j a_j .
If one assigns degree  to ,  is
of degree  and  is homogeneous of degree , so that 
 is of degree .

In the following, we shall treat the functions  as independant
algebraic indeterminates , as already suggested in previous
notations. This requires some justification. We need to show that if
 is a nonzero abstract polynomial, the function
 cannot vanish for every realization of
 and every .  Indeed, assume the countrary and take a
counterexample  of minimal degree. As
, the Ito differential of 
vanishes identically as well : 
.
Multiplication by  yields 
 which can be plugged back into
the original equation. So  
and .
Because  and  decrease the
degree and  is a counterexample of minimal degree,  and
 vanish as abstract polynomials. So the
question whether the functions  are algebraically independant
is reduced to the purely algebraic question whether the system of
linear algebraic equations 
 has only the constant polynomials as solutions. 
This will be proved at the end of section 4.

2- SLE martingales. 
The set  of polynomial functions in the  forms a graded
vector space , with elements of
 homogeneous polynomials of degree . The operator 
 maps  into .

Polynomial martingales are, by definition, polynomials in the 
annihilated by . Their set  is
graded:  with 
.  The low degree martingales are: 
M _1 &:& a_1 
 
M _2 &:& 2a_1^2-a_2 
 
M _3 &:& 2a_1^3-3a_1a_2, a_3 + a_1a_2

Let 
 with 
.  Crucial to the sequel is
the character formula  
char M =1-q^2 _j0 (1-q^j) 

This may be compared to 
, 
in particular  for 
. 

We shall give a proof of eq.() using the general machinery
in section 5.  A direct argument can be organized as follows. We want
to show that the sequence 
 is exact, i.e. that
 for . Decompose 
 where 
. It is clear that 
 for  because if 
is any polynomial in , we can set 

, which satisfies clearly .
Now we do perturbation theory.  Starting from , we define two
sequences  and  by ,
, 
, , 
, . The key point if that these sequences
stop. Indeed, if  is non zero, then its total degree is that of
 but its degree in  is at least one more than that of
 :  increases the degree in the variable  by
one unit and  contains no derivative with respect to
. So  and then  have to vanish for large enough
. Hence one can sum the definition 
over , leading to a telescopic cancellation 
, showing that  is onto.

3- Group theoretical background.  
Let us recall a few basic facts concerning the Borel-Weil
construction in group theory. Consider for instance a simply
connected compact Lie group . 
The group acts on itself by left or right
multiplication. This induces a representation of the Lie algebra 
 on functions on  by left or right invariant vector fields:
(X^l) f(g)&=& d du f(ge^uX )_u=0 ,

(X^r) f(g)&=& d du f(e^uX g)_u=0 for any . They form a representation of 
 since 
and .

Let us choose a Cartan subgroup , and let  be the
associated nilpotent subgroups and  be 
the corresponding Borel subgroups
(For ,  is made of diagonal complex matrices and
 of lower (upper) triangular matrices with  along the
diagonal.) .
At least in a neighbourhood of the identity, elements  of 
may be factorized according to the Gaussian decomposition as
 with  and . We set
,  and , the components of  in ,
in  and in , respectively. For elements , we
shall denote by ,  and  their components in 
, in  and in , respectively.

One may define two actions of  on  by:
 l_x(g)&& (gxg^-1 )_+^-1 g x= (gxg^-1 )_- g 

 r_x(g) && x^-1  g (g^-1 xg)_+ = g (g^-1 xg)_-^-1  for  and . They act on  since 
and  for . They form anti-representations of :

because
.

The Borel-Weil construction consists in defining an action of the group
 on sections of line bundles over the quotient space . 
Sections of  may be viewed as functions  
on  such that
S^l(n_+g)&=& S^l(g),       n_+N_+ 

S^l(hg) &=& (h) S^l(g),hH 
with  a -valued -character such that
. Such a character is specified by 
a weight  via 
for .

The group  acts on such sections by right
multiplication:  for . 
This action defines a representation of :
.
Since  may locally be identified with , we may
choose a gauge in which  and view  as functions on
 with specific transformation properties.  The action of  then
reads: 

(L_xS^l)(g)= ((gxg^-1 )_0)
S^l(l_x(g)), xG, gN_-
Infinitesimally, this action may be presented as first order
differential operator:
(D^l_XS^l)(g) &=& 
d du  (L_e^uX  S^l)(g)_u=0 


&=& ((X^l) - ((gXg^-1 )_+^r))S^l(g) 
-(, (gXg^-1 )_0)S^l(g) with  and  the left and right invariant vector fields.
By construction . Note that  coincides
with  for .

A similar construction applies to the right quotient  and its
sections , defined similarly as in eq.() but with
right instead of left multiplications. The group  acts on sections
 by left multiplications: .
In the gauge in which , this action reads:
(R_xS^r)(g)((g^-1 xg)_0)
S^r(r_x(g)), xG, gN_-
Infinitesimally:
(D^r_XS^l)(g) = (((g^-1 Xg)_+^l) -
(X^r))S^r(g) - (, (g^-1 Xg)_0)S^l(g)
By construction .

These left and right actions are linked by
the relation .
Therefore, if  are represented as first order differential
operators in  a specific set of coordinates parametrizing ,
then  will be represented by the same differential operators but
in the coordinates parametrizing the inverse element .

4- Differential representations of the Virasoro algebra.  
We now apply the previous construction to the Virasoro algebra
with generators ,  integers, and relations:



with  central. By convention,  is generated by
the  with ,  by  and , and 
 by the  with .  

We have to select a set of coordinates in , at least in a
neighbourhood of the identity. This is provided by
looking at the representation in which the Virasoro
generators are represented by . 
The  orbits of a point  in the complex plane define (germs
of) complex maps  with a simple pole at infinity:
w(z)g z g^-1  = _n0  a_n z^1-n ,gN_- 
with . The  form a set of coordinates parametrizing
elements of .
We shall also need the inverse map :
z(w) = _n0  b_n w^1-n  The  are polynomials in the  of degree  and .

Let us first deal with sections of the left quotient 
. To define them we have to specify the
-character, or equivalently the weight . 
It is specified by 
two numbers  and  such that  and 
. The action of the Virasoro generators on
functions of the  is then defined by the formula
(). One may view  as functions of the  and
use it as generating functions. We then have(Here, we use the
convention that for a Laurent series ,
 and .) :

Proposition. 

i) The action of the Virasoro algebra on
 specified by eq.() reads:
D_n^lw(z) &=& -w(z)^n+1  
+ ( w^n+1 dz dw  )_+ (dw dz ) 

& &       -(  (gL_ng^-1 )_L_0  
+ c (gL_ng^-1 )_c  ) w(z) with




where  is the
Schwarzian derivative of  with respect to .

ii) The first order differential operators  in the 
satisfy the Virasoro algebra 

and are such that  for  and . 

Proof.  The three terms in eq.() correspond to the
three terms in eq.(). They may be computed one by one
using the following relations, which we just quote without proofs. 
First one has:

(L_n.^l)w(z)&=& g[_n,z]g^-1 =-w^n+1 

(L_n.^r)w(z)&=& [_n, gzg^-1 ]=-z^n+1  (dw dz )Then,  is evaluated using the transformation properties
 of the stress tensor :

 
Recall that . This gives:



In particular, ,

The differential operators  may be written explicitely.
They are of the form 
 with 
, and ,
 and  homogeneous polynomials.
The first few are:
D_-2 ^l&=& D _-2 ^l(a) 

D_-1 ^l&=& D _-1 ^l(a) 

D_0 ^l&=& D _0 ^l(a) -

D_1 ^l&=& D _1 ^l(a) -2a_1 

D_2 ^l&=& D _2 ^l(a)-(3a_1^2+ 4a_2)- c 2 a_2 with  vector fields given by:
D ^l_-2 (a)&=& -_j2  p_j (a) a_j  
 
D ^l_-1 (a)&=& - a_1  

D ^l_0 (a)&=& -_j1  ja_j a_j 

D ^l_1 (a)&=& -_j1 ( _p+q=j+1  a_pa_q +
ja_j+1  + 2(j-1) a_1a_j )  a_j 

D ^l_2 (a)&=& -_j1  ( _p+q+r=j+2  a_pa_qa_r +
(j+1)a_j+2   

& &               + 3j a_1a_j+1 + (j-1)(3a_1^2+4a_2)a_j ) 
 a_j The above sums include the terms with .
These five operators generate the whole Virasoro algebra.
They act on polynomial functions of the .

Note that it was imperative to consider sections of 
 associated to non trivial -characters in order to get
representations of the Virasoro algebra with non vanishing central
charges.  To make contact with usual highest weight representations,
one may define generators  which satisfy the
Virasoro algebra with central charge . They are such that 
 for  and , so that  is
a highest weight vector for the .

As explained above, one may define another action of the Virasoro
algebra using the right quotient .  Its generators
 are defined via eq.(). 
According to the last remark of the previous section, one goes from
 to  by exchanging the role played by  and its
inverse, so that  coincides with  but with the variables
 replaced by those parametrizing the inverse map:
 D_n^r = D_n^l(a_jb_j) The two representations  and  do not commmute. 

Let us remark that although the space of (polynomial) functions in the  may
be identified with a Fock space, these representations are not the usual
free field representations used in conformal field theory. 
As far as we know, these representations
were not previously described in the literature.
They are similar in spirit to the representations of affine Kac-Moody
algebras studied in.


We end this section by showing that a polynomial  such that
 and  is constant,
thereby completing the proof, started below eq.(),
that the functions  are
algebraically independent. The key observation is that 
 has the form 

, where  is a polynomial,
. This results from  the recursive
definition of  and the fact that, as a polynomial in ,
  terms of lower degree.
By hypothesis, the polynomial  is
annihilated by  and 
. Hence it is annihilated by all
's. The polynomial  depends effectively on only a finite
number of variables : there is a minimal  such that 
, . If ,   implies that
 contradicting minimality. So 
and  is constant, as was to be proved.

5- Martingale generating algebra.  
Let us now make contact between the stochastic Loewner equation 
and the representations of the Virasoro algebra we just define.

Comparing the evolution operator , eq.(),
and the operator , eqs.(), it is clear that 
one has the following identification:



In other words, the stochastic evolution () is associated
with the action the Virasoro algebra on sections of the left quotient
. 

On the other hand, the martingale generating algebra is not
constructed using the representation , since it does not
commute with , but using the representation  based on
the right quotient . Indeed, we have:

Proposition. 
For  and
, one has the commutation relations:
[ A , D_n^r ] = q_n(a_1,) A

with  homogeneous polynomials in the
 of degree .
 In particular, the generators  act on
, so that if  then 
. 

Proof.  This follows by construction.
For ,  coincide with the right invariant vector fields
which commute with the left invariant vector fields and thus with
. For , eq.() may  be checked directly
using the following relation 
[D_Y^l,D_X^r]f(g) &=& ( [Y, (g^-1 Xg)_+]-[Y,
(g^-1 Xg)]_+)^l f(g) 

&& +(,[Y,(g^-1 Xg)]_0) f(g)valid for  and .
For instance, applying this formula for  leads to :


The first term in the right hand side vanishes for 
. Similarly,  gives:
[A, D_2^r]f &=& 
3(6-- 2)b_1(L_-1 ^l)f

&& +((8-3)+ c)f -2(3b_1^2 + 4b_2)(Af)The first two terms in the r.h.s. vanish for 
 and . Note that 
and . The higher degree polynomials
 are recursively determined by 
.

Let us first prove eq.() using this proposition.  Since
 and since  has
degree , proving formula () amounts to show that 
 is surjective. We do it by recursion
using the fact that , , commute with . Let
.  By the recursion hypothesis, there exist
 and  such that
 and . Let us define
recursively  by
. By construction they satisfy:
i)  and ii)
. Relation ii) is the
integrability condition for the existence of  such
that . Relation i) then gives 
 for all . This implies , meaning that
 is surjective. Note that this proof is dual to the proof
given at the end of section 4 that the functions  are
algebraically independant.


Let us now remark that acting successively with  on the
constant function  generates  martingales. For instance: 
D_1^r1 &=& (6-  ) a_1 

4D_2^r 1 = - D_1^r ^2 1 &=&
3(6-  )(a_2 -2 a_1^2)

Recall that the operators  are obtained from the ,
eq.(), by replacing  by .  
More generally, the space 
of polynomials in the  generated by successive actions of the
 on the constant function, that is

is made of martingales and so it is embedded in
. By construction it carries a representation of the
Virasoro algebra. It is well know that its character is

So  and  
. 

In other words, all polynomial 
martingales are generated by successive actions of the Virasoro
differential operators associated to the right quotient.

6- Lifted SLE.  Let us finally make contact with the group
theoretical formulation of the stochastic Loewner evolution proposed
in ref.. There, the  was lifted to a Markov process
in the nilpotent subgroup  of the Virasoro group defined by:
 
The associated stochastic evolution operator, acting on function of
, was identified with


See ref. for details. The random group element  is
related to the random conformal map  by  
in the representation with .
Since  is simply  for ,
the operators  and  clearly coincide.

A generating function of  martingales was
identified in. It is given by the vector 
 which takes values in the irreducible (for
generic ) Virasoro module, called , 
with highest weight vector 
of central charge  and
conformal weight .
In a graded basis of ,
the components of 
are polynomial  martingales by construction. As is well known,
  
and this allows us to identifies 
with , so that the   martingales generated by
 coincide with those
obtained above by successive actions with the .
This actually follows by construction, since in the Borel-Weil
construction, sections  of  may be identified with
matrix element  with
 highest weight vector.
