We study partially supersymmetric plane-wave like deformations
of string theories and M-theory on brane backgrounds.
These deformations are dual to nonlocal field theories. 
We calculate various expectation values of configurations 
of closed as well as open Wilson loops and Wilson surfaces
in those theories. We also discuss the manifestation of the
nonlocality structure in the supergravity backgrounds.
A plane-wave like deformation of little string theory 
has also been studied.

Introduction 










The pp-wave metric 




is a deformation of the  dimensional Minkowski metric with the  
property
that all the scalars that can be constructed out of the
curvature tensor are identically zero.
Realizations of such metrics in string theory have been extensively studied 
recently (see for example-).
In string theory such a metric can be realized if there is also
a nonzero RR or NSNS flux.
For example, the following equation describes a good type-II background 
when the string coupling constant ,
ds^2 &=& dx^+  dx^-  -dd
--2 ()(dx^+ )^2,H = ^-1  -2 dddx^+ ,

&& (x^1,,x^8).
Here  is a 3-form NSNS flux (for ) or RR flux
(for , the string coupling constant)
and  is a constant antisymmetric  matrix.
Such backgrounds have been constructed in
.
In lightcone gauge the worldsheet theories that correspond to such
backgrounds are free.
To see this in the case of NSNS flux requires a change of variables 
 ( see also),
and the case of RR flux was demonstrated in.

One can also find a deformation of the 
metric by a  term as follows:
ds^2 &=& R^2 r^2 (dx^+  dx^-  -dd-dr^2)
-R^2 r^4 ()(dx^+ )^2 - R^2 dd,

B &=& 1 r^2 ddx^+ .
Here  is a unit vector in  that parameterizes the  of
radius  and
we have written the NSNS 2-form field potential  instead of the
field strength.
There is also a 5-form flux. It is also possible to replace the NSNS
2-form  in () with an RR 2-form field with exactly the
same form but with a prefactor of .
Backgrounds similar to those have been recently discussed in
. This background has the property that all the
scalars that can be constructed out of the curvature tensor are identical
to those of the undeformed  space.
Since  is dual to   Super-Yang-Mills theory
 it is interesting to find out what field theory
is dual to the supergravity background ().(
Background similar to () has also been studied in
 in the context of lightlike noncommutativity
field theory.)  It would be also
interesting to generalize
this deformation for other brane backgrounds.

One of the purposes of this paper is to describe the field theory duals of
() and other backgrounds that can be similarly described as a
deformation
of  with a  in the metric and with lightlike 
[i.e. of the form ] fluxes.
We will find that () describes the large  limit of a gauge
theory with nonlocal interactions. We will describe how the nonlocal
interactions
manifest themselves in () and we will study expectation values of
various configurations of Wilson loops in the theory.

Another purpose of this paper is to observe that nonlocal deformations of
field theories are a rather general phenomenon that occurs when
 is deformed with extra Lorentz invariance breaking fluxes.
We will describe a deformation of  that corresponds
to a nonlocal deformation of the  theory and the nonlocality is
described by a parameter that is a 2-form.
We will also discuss various deformations of the 5+1D little string theory 
.

The paper is organized as follows.
In sections -we present a set of backgrounds that can be obtained
from flat space by a simple construction. These "twisted" backgrounds will
serve as the ambient space for brane probes in section .
We will argue that the theories on the probes are in general nonlocal.
We will study their large  limit in section .
There we will discover that the backgrounds such as () are
the supergravity duals of nonlocal field theories.
We follow in section  with a study of Wilson loops
and their generalizations in such backgrounds.
In section  we will demonstrate various manifestations
of the nonlocal nature of the supergravity backgrounds. The last section
is devoted to the discussion.

Construction of twisted backgrounds 
Our goal in this section is to construct backgrounds for M-theory
and string theory.
These will be non-geometrical backgrounds where brane probes are,
in general, described by nonlocal field theories.
These backgrounds are a subset of those constructed in
and we will review them below.
To construct the backgrounds we 
start with M-theory or string-theory compactified on .
We then continuously deform the geometry while
keeping the space locally flat. 
We do this by introducing a  "geometrical" twist.
Using T-duality or U-duality on these backgrounds
we will then construct non-geometrical twists.

Geometrical twists 

We will use the term "geometrical twist"  to refer to a 
compactification on  with nontrivial Wilson loops
for the transverse  (in string theory, or
in M-theory ) rotation group.
Take  commuting elements



and define the space that is locally 
but with the global identifications
(x_0,x_1,, x_d,) &&
(x_0,
x_1 + 2n_1 R_1,
,
x_d + 2n_d R_d,
_j=1 ^d_j^n_j ),

 &&
(x_d+1 ,,x_9).
A special case of this background is  with the identification
sotw 
(x_0, x_1, ) 
(x_0,x_1 + 2R,)
(x_2,,x_9).
Here  is a rotation matrix.
We will denote this space by .
spXdef 
(R,) = 9,1 /
(x_0, x_1, ) 
(x_0,x_1 + 2R,)
A field  in the geometry given by ()
can be expanded as





Here  is an eigenfunction of  with eigenvalue ,



This expansion shows that states with a given
-charge have fractional momentum in
the  direction. Similarly, in the geometry ()
a state  with a specific  () charge given
by   (that is )
has fractional Kaluza-Klein momentum in the 
direction and the fractional part is given by .


T-duals and U-duals of twists 
We will now define a T-dual twist as follows.
By definition, type-IIB on a circle of radius  with a T-dual
twist given by  is 
type-IIA on  [defined in ()].
Intuitively, we can think of the dual twist as a setting
where a state 
with a specific  charge given
by   (that is )
has fractional string winding number (around the circle of radius )
and the fractional part is given by .

In a similar fashion we can define the U-duals of a twist.
We will identify the various twists according to the objects whose
charges become fractional.
Thus, we will call the T-dual twists F1-twists (F1 stands for
the fundamental string).
We can define D1-twists as the S-dual of type-IIB with an F1-twist.
We can also deform type-II string theory on  to include
D-twists. M-theory on  can have an M2-twist parameterized
by an element of the transverse rotation group .
It means that states with transverse angular momentum that transform
nontrivially under  have a fractional wrapped M2-brane charge.

Note that even though we have used charges to characterize
the twists we do not really need to single out the time direction.
For example, we can define a Euclidean type-IIA theory on
 with a D0-brane twist in  as a Euclidean
version of M-theory compactified on  with a geometrical twist.
This is the Melvin solution.
U-duality then suggests that other D-brane twists are parameterized
by elements in  rather than .
Similarly, in M-theory we can have M5-brane twists parameterized
by an element of  [rather than ].

In all those cases where we have M-theory or string theory
on  with volume  and wrapped -brane twists 
 ( in string theory and
  in M-theory) we can take
the decompactification limit




We get a background
where an eigenstate   of  [acting as an 
angular momentum generator] that satisfies 
 formally has the charge of a piece
of a -brane with volume . (The  factors will simplify
upcoming formulas.)

In this way we can obtain backgrounds that are parameterized
by an element  and preserve translational invariance
in  (in string theory, or  in M-theory) directions.

Notation 
We will start from type-II toroidal compactifications where space-time is 
of the form .
We use the following notation for charges:
 
If  are noncompact directions,
we will denote by  the angular momentum that corresponds
to rotations in the  plane.  is therefore integral
for bosons and half-integral for fermions.
A geometrical twist such as () with  a rotation in the 
 plane by an angle , for example, will be described by the
equation: 



We define
I_1 I_2I_p  && 
(2)^p R_I_1 R_I_p I_1 I_2I_p ,

I  2R_II ,


2 I_1 I_2  &&
(2)^2 R_I_1  R_I_2 2 I_1 I_2 ,5 I_1I_5 (2)^5 R_I_1 R_I_5 
5 I_1 I_5 


I_1I_5  &&
(2)^5 R_I_1 R_I_5 I_1I_5 ,
The prefactors are the volumes of the corresponding branes.

Supergravity solutions of generalized twisted backgrounds 

In this section we shall study the general twisted background in 
type II string theories and M-theory. These can be obtained from
compactification of string/M-theory on a torus with nontrivial
Wilson loops for the transverse rotation group
as we demonstrated in the previous section. Probing this
background with a brane would lead to a nonlocal field theory.
One can also make a boost in  the obtained backgrounds to find backgrounds
with lightlike twist (see).
Probing this background will also give a field theory with nonlocality
in a lightlike direction.
A special case of a D3-brane has recently been studied
in where a (nonlocal) dipole theory is obtained.
It is the aim of this section to generalize
this construction for other brane backgrounds in string/M-theory.


Fundamental string twist 
Concentrating on the geometry of () we take the limit





Here  is an  lie-algebra valued element with dimensions
of length.
Using T-duality, the metric (in string units) is found to be
    ds^2  &=& dt^2  - 1 1 + -2 ^  dx_1^2
        - dd+(d)^2  
        )  
Here  denotes the coordinate in the  transverse directions
and .
We also have an NSNS 2-form and a dilaton
Bphi 
B = d 2 +^) dx^1,
 e^2(= 1 1 +-2 ^ .
This is the background that we denoted by



Note that the dilaton can be made small everywhere.
The metric, however, becomes singular as 
and therefore -corrections are important when 
.

Similarly one can find a twisted background in which  takes its value in 
the  Lie-algebra. In this case the metric is given by






while the B field and the dilaton are the same as
().



Generalized twists 

The S-dual configuration to ()-() is given by
ds^2  &=& 
e^_0 (1 + -2 ^ )^1 2  
dt^2  -dd
 && -e^_0 (1 + -2 ^ )^-1 2  
dx_1^2 --2 (d)^2 
,


C^(RR)  &=& 
  d + ^ dx^1,
 e^  = e^_0 (1 +-2 ^)^1 2  
This is the background that we denoted by



Here  [or even ] but if we take 
 and restrict
 to an  subgroup [or perhaps ] we
can compactify  directions and apply T-duality to get
the type-II metric
ds^2  &=& 
e^_0 (1 +-(p+1)  ^ )^1 2  
dt^2 
-dd
 &&
-e^_0 (1 +-(p+1)  ^ )^-1 2  
_i=1 ^p dx_i^2
--(p+1) (d)^2 
,


C^(RR) &=& e^p-1 2 _0 
  d p+1  + ^ dx^1
dx^p,

 e^ =e^_0  
   (1 +-(p+1) ^)^p-3 4   .

 &&
In the above formula we have absorbed a factor of 
in  so as to make it of dimensions .
In the notation of  this background corresponds to



We can lift the type-IIA metric with a D2-brane twist to obtain
M-theory with an M2-twist.
ds^2  &=& 
(1 + l_p^-6 ^ )^1 3  
dt^2  -dd-dx_10 ^2

 &&
-(1 + l_p^-6 ^ )^-2 3  
_i=1 ^2 dx_i^2 -l_p^-6 (d)^2 
,


C &=& d l_p^6 + ^   dx^1dx^2,
In the notation of  this background corresponds to



We can also lift the type-IIA metric with a D4-brane twist to
obtain M-theory with an M5-twist.
ds^2  &=& 
(1 + l_p^-12 ^ )^2 3  
dt^2  -dd

 &&
-(1 + l_p^-12 ^ )^-1 3  
_i=1 ^4 dx_i^2 +dx_10 ^2
-l_p^-12 (d)^2 
,


 ^* dC &=& 
dd l_p^12  + ^ 
-2dd^ (l_p^12  + ^)^2 
    dx^1dx^4dx^10 ,
 &&
In the notation of  this background corresponds to



Finally we can lift the type-IIA metric with a D6-brane twist.
In this case  is 3-dimensional and we can take  to be
proportional to the generator of rotations in directions .
Let  denote its magnitude.
We also set .
Thus,




    ds^2  &=& 
e^_0 (1 + ^2z^2)^1 2  
dt^2  -dz^2 -dx_7^2

 &&
-e^_0 (1 + ^2z^2)^-1 2  
_i=1 ^6 dx_i^2
-^2 4 z d-dz^2
,


dC^(RR)  &=& 
i -7 2  e^5 2 _0  
   (1 + ^2z^2)^2 dzd
   dx^1dx^6,
 e^  = e^_0 (1 + ^2z^2)^-3 4  .

 &&
Note that



The dual RR field is



Thus the 1-form RR-field can be taken to be



Lifting to M-theory and setting  we obtain the metric








ds^2  &=& 
(1 + ^2 r^2)dt^2  -dr^2 -dx_7^2 -r^2 d^2 -1 1 + ^2 r^2 (dx_10 +x_7 dt)^2
 -_i=1 ^6 dx_i^2

 &&
and no fluxes.
But note that it is not supersymmetric and the issue of stability is
not clear.

Lightlike twists 

We can also find lightlike twisted backgrounds of string theory or M-theory 
by making use of a boost from the dipole twisted backgrounds which have
been described so far (see also). 
This can also be thought of as taking the Penrose 
limit of the corresponding dipole twisted backgrounds. 
To begin with we consider the following  boost
in the  direction  
t =t-x_p,
x _p=-t-x_p,
or 
x^+=e^- y^+,x^- =e^ y^-,
with  and .

To have a lightlike dipole we now take the infinite boost limit,
.
In order to end up with a lightlike dipole vector with finite component
we must simultaneously scale  while  keeping the 
following quantity fixed
e^ =finite 
In this limit the background () reads
ds^2  &=& dx^+  dx^-  
+14 -(p+1) (^ )(dx^+ )^2 
 -dd-_i=1 ^p-1 (dx^i)^2,


C^RR  &=& 12 -(p+1)  
(d) dx^1dx^p-1 dx^+ ,
 e^2(0 )  = 1,
which is the RR pp-wave specified by



Similarly we can also find the NSNS pp-wave background by making use of 
a boost from the twisted backgrounds studied
in subsection .  
For example the lightlike background specified by



is the NSNS pp-wave given by
ds^2  &=& dx^+  dx^-  
+14 -2 (^ )(dx^+ )^2 - dd,


B &=& 12 -2 (d) dx^+ ,
 e^2(0 )  = 1.
The same procedure can be applied to M-theory twisted backgrounds. 
In this way we will be able to find the lightlike twisted background in
M-theory.
For example from the M2-twist background () of M-theory using 
a boost similar to () and () one finds
ds^2 &=& dx^+ dx^-  
+14  l_p^-6 (^)(dx^+ )^2 - 
dd-dx_1^2-dx_10 ^2 ,C&=&12  l_p^-6 (d)dx^1dx^+ ,
which corresponds to



The lightlike twist background of M-theory corresponding to
 can also be obtained from
the Penrose limit of the M5-twist background. 

We note that the pp-wave backgrounds studied in this section provide
string theory backgrounds in which the string theory can be exactly
solved. The lightlike twist will also provide pp-wave backgrounds of 
M-theory and it would be interesting to study the Matrix model of these
pp-wave backgrounds. In particular one can find a pp-wave-like background in
M-theory without any fluxes. This background can be obtained by taking
the Penrose limit from ()
ds^2&=&dx^+ dx^-  +1 4 ^2z^2 (dx^+ )^2-dz^2-dx_7^2
-_i=1 ^5 dx_i^2
-(dx_10 +1 2 x^7 dx^+ )^2.

 &&
We note, however, that it is not obvious whether this is a stable background
of M-theory.
Backgrounds somewhat reminiscent of this have recently been discussed
in-.
 
Probing with branes and new nonlocal theories 

We will now examine brane probes in the various twisted geometries.
In many cases we will discover new types of nonlocal field theories.
The configurations that we will discuss are related to configurations
of D-branes in pp-wave backgrounds.
Such configurations have been discussed extensively in
-but mostly in the context of the pp-wave limit
relevant for and not so much for the twisted backgrounds.

Fundamental string twists 
In this case  and  has dimensions of length.
We take the fundamental string twist to be in the direction of 
and take  D-branes that extend in directions .
The twist  is then an element of the Lie algebra 
corresponding to rotations in the remaining directions.
This case of a fundamental string twist has been studied
and in the case that
 the resulting low-energy 
description of the dynamics of the brane is a theory of fundamental
dipoles with lengths proportional to the eigenvalues of .
In order to be self-contained we have included a review of dipole theories
in appendix .
The proof that the dipole-theory is indeed the low energy description
on the brane probe will not be repeated here,
but intuitively we can argue as follows.
On a D-brane the fundamental string is identified with electric flux.
So dipoles naturally behave like fixed size open strings. The statement
that states with  charge also have a finite string length
translates on the D-branes to the statement that states with
R-symmetry charge are dipoles.


If, on the other hand,
the D-brane probes are transverse to the twist we get a massive
deformation of Super Yang-Mills theory.
For example, let us take  D-probes in directions .
It is convenient to compactify the direction of  on a circle
of radius .
T-duality on that circle will give us D-branes wrapped
on a circle of radius  with a geometrical twist of 
magnitude .
It is not hard to see that the effect of the twist on the 
low energy description in  dimensions is to add 
a mass term to the scalars and fermions of  dimensional
 Super Yang-Mills theory. The mass term is given by
MassFtw 
4^2-2 ^^+2-1 ^.
Here  represents the scalars, written as a vector in the 
fundamental representation of  and 
 represents the fermions, written as a vector in the spinor 
representation of .  that appears in the formula above
should be interpreted as  a matrix in the appropriate representation.

Again, we can heuristically understand the mass term as follows.
In the presence of the twist, particles with R-symmetry
charge behave like finite fundamental strings that
are perpendicular to the D-branes and have length
proportional to the corresponding eigenvalue of .
Their mass is therefore proportional to .
Of course, in string theory there are no finite fundamental strings
perpendicular to the D-brane but the intuitive picture gives the correct
mass for the R-symmetry charged particles.
Using the supergravity solution
()-() the mass term can be interpreted as 
a gravitational potential that attracts the D-brane probe to the
origin of the transverse space .


D-brane twists 
We get new nonlocal field theories
when we probe the generalized  twisted backgrounds with D-branes.
For most of these cases, we do not have a simple field theory 
description.
Let us explore various new possibilities that arise.





D3-probes with a longitudinal D1-twist 

This is the S-dual theory to the D3-probes with a 
longitudinal fundamental string twist.
Since the latter is described by the dipole-theory
the S-dual should be a field theory with fundamental magnetic dipoles.
For a small dipole vector matrix  the electric dipole theories
can be describedas a deformation of   SYM by the operator




where  is the dimension- operator
_^IJ  &=&
       i^2  
       F_  ^^[I  D_^J] 
   +_K (D_^K)^[K ^I^J]  
        + fermions   Here  are R-symmetry indices,
 () are the scalars,
 is the
covariant derivative,  is the field strength
and  means complete anti-symmetrization.

is a vector operator that transforms in the  of the
R-symmetry group .

The magnetic dipole theory should be described, to linear order
in , by the deformation 
where  is the dual dimension- operator
_^IJ  &=&
       i^2  
       _  ^^[I  D_^J] 
   +_K (D_^K)^[K ^I^J]  
        + fermions   where 
is the dual (nonabelian) field strength.


Supergravity solutions of D-branes and NS5-branes and
the large  limit 

In this section we shall first review Dp-brane probes of the F1 twist 
geometry. The obtained supergravity solution is a Dp-brane solution 
in  the presence of B field with one leg along the worldvolume and the 
other along the directions transverse to the brane. 
This background would provide the supergravity description of noncommutative
dipole field theory(Special cases of dipole theories have been discussed
in and various aspects 
of the theories have been explored in-,
see also.) . 
We then consider a 
new set of nonlocal theories by performing a boost along the worldvolume 
direction of the brane in which the  field is nonzero.
Generalizations to
NS5-branes with RR field and M-theory with  form
field will also be studied. 

We note also that making a boost (the Penrose limit) in a nonlocal theory has 
recently been considered in-.



Review of the supergravity dual of dipole theory  

By probing the F1 twist geometry with Dp-branes we find a 
supergravity solution of Dp-branes in the presence of a B-field 
with one leg along the worldvolume and the other along the transverse 
directions to the braneds^2 &=& f^-1 2   ( dt^2 - dx^2_1 -p-1  
-  d x^2_p  + r^2   ) 
&& &-& f^1 2   ( dr^2 + r^2 dd- 
r^4 (d)^2 + r^2   
 ), &&
 e^2  &=&  g^2_s f^3-p 2   +
 r^2   ,&&
_a=p+1 ^9 B_pa  dx_a &=&  r^2 d  + 
r^2  ,
where  is an -dimensional unit vector, , and




Also,  is the same  element from
subsection .
In general this background breaks the supersymmetry completely, 
but for special cases of the matrix 
some supersymmetries can be left intact.
Another problem that has to be considered is the stability 
of the solution. It is not obvious that the solutions we found are 
stable. Nevertheless, taking  the matrix  such that the solutions 
preserve some  amount of supersymmetries, as we will consider, 
would hopefully lead to stable solutions. In fact, in this paper we 
shall mostly 
consider matrices  such that 8 supersymmetries are preserved.

It has also been arguedthat the worldvolume theory of the 
supergravity solution () decouples from bulk gravity
leading to a nonlocal theory, i.e. noncommutative dipole 
theory (reviewed in appendix ).
The decoupling limit, in which the worldvolume theory
decouples from the bulk, is defined by 
keeping the following quantities fixed
urp-3 2   g_s .
In this limit the supergravity solution () reads
-1  ds^2 &=& (u R )^7-p 2  
( dt^2 - dx_1^2 -dx_p^2 1+u^2   )
 &&&-& (R u )^7-p 2

with
R^7-p  = 2^7-2p  ^9-3p 2   (7-p 2 )^2 N,
 
^2 = (2)^p-2   .
This supergravity solution provides the gravity dual of the noncommutative
dipole gauge theory.

Starting from the case of  and applying S-duality one can find the
supergravity solution of type IIB NS5-branes in the 
presence of an RR 2-form potential with one leg along the brane and the
other along the transverse directions. This could provide the gravity
dual of the dipole deformation of little string theory. We can also make
a series of T-duality transformations
to produce a new supergravity solution. This supergravity
solution describes type II NS5-branes 
in the presence of RR -form, for , with
one leg along the transverse directions and  legs along
the NS5-branes worldvolume. The corresponding supergravity solution
in the decoupling limit is given by
ds^2&=&(1+u^2L^2)^1/2 [ dt^2-_i=1 ^p dx_i^2-
_j=p+1 ^5dx_j^2 
1+u^2L^2  &&
&-&Nu^2 ( du^2+u^2d_3-u^4L^2 
1+u^2L^2 (a_1d_1+a_2d_2  
+  a_3d_3)^2) ] ,
&&e^2 &=&N l_s^2 u^2 (1+u^2L^2)^(p-2)/2 ,&&_a=6 ^9 C_(p+1)5_a d_a&=&u^2L 
1+u^2L^2 (a_1d_1+a_2d_2+a_3d_3),
where 's are angular coordinates parameterizing the sphere 
 transverse to the NS5-branes, and
a_1_2,
a_2-_1 _1 _2,
a_3^2 _1 ^2 _2.
Note that in the above solution we have chosen the matrix  in such a 
way that the system is maximally supersymmetric which means that 
the solution preserves 8 supercharges. For this case the matrix  has the
following form
0&L&0&0-L&0&0&00&0&0&L0&0&-L&0 .
Lightlike dipole theory 

In this section we shall study the lightlike dipole theory using its
gravity description. To find the corresponding supergravity 
solution we start with a background in which the probe Dp-branes have a
small spacelike dipole vector and then we perform a large boost.
In fact we will consider the following boost
in the  direction  
t =t-x_p,
x _p=-t-x_p,
or 
x^+=e^- y^+,x^- =e^ y^-,
with  and .

To have a lightlike dipole we now take the infinite boost limit,
.
In order to end up with a lightlike dipole vector with finite component
we must, at the same time, also take the limit 
 while keeping the following quantity fixed
e^ =finite 
In this limit the background () reads
ds^2l_s^2 &=&(u R )^(7-p) 2  [
-dx^+dx^-+4 u^2(dx^+)^2-
dx_1^2-p-1 ^2]&&&-& (R u )^7-p 2  [du^2+u^2d_8-p ^2
],&&e^2 &=&^2(Ru )^
(7-p)(3-p)2  , 
and
_a=p+1 ^9 B_+a d_a=12 u^2 d.





One can now choose the matrix  such that the solution preserves 
8 supercharges. For this Dp-brane case such a matrix  is given by
6-p,7-p  -e_7-p,6-p  +e_8-p,9-p -e_9-p,8-p ),
where  are a set of  matrices
of dimensions 
and are defined by .
The effective dipole moment of the noncommutative dipole 
theory described by () is defined to be
22L_i=1 ^5-p _i,
for p=1,,5,
where  [] are angular coordinates
parameterizing the sphere  transverse to the Dp-brane such
that








In the large boost limit we have  while
 is kept fixed.
We define
mueffdef 
2(_1,,_8-p )2e^ to be the finite effective magnitude of the lightlike dipole vector.

For this case with 8 preserved supercharges
the metric () reads
-1 ds^2&=&(u R )^(7-p) 2  [
-dx^+dx^-+^2 4 u^2(dx^+)^2-
dx_1^2-p-1 ^2]&&&-& (R u )^7-p 2  [du^2+u^2d_8-p ^2
], 
Deformations of little string theory 

One can also proceed to study the lightlike deformation of 
little string theory. To do this, we start from the supergravity
solution () and perform a boost in the  direction.
Using a boost similar to ()-() 
in the limit  and taking into account
the finiteness condition () for the lightlike dipole
the supergravity solution () reads
ds^2&=&-dx^+dx^-+^24 u^2(dx^+)^2
-Ndu^2u^2 -Ni=1 ^4dx_i^2,&&e^2 &=&N_aC_(p+1)4 +_a d_a
=u^22 (a_1d_1+a_2d_2+a_3d_3),
where  is again the magnitude of the lightlike dipole vector. 
Note that there is also a two form  field representing the 
charge of the NS5-branes which is given by
dB=where  is the volume form of the  sphere transverse to the 
NS5-branes.

Interestingly enough, the string theory in this obtained background 
can be exactly solved. Actually, the string theory in this  
Liouville PP-wave background in light-cone gauge can be described by 
the level   WZW model plus a Liouville field
and four free scalars. The Liouville PP-wave background in
string theory has been considered in
 as a background in which the
string theory can be exactly solved. It would be interesting to analyze
the string theory in the background ().

Supergravity duals of disc theories 

In this section we will consider a nonlocal theory where the 
parameter of nonlocality is a tensor.
This theory can be naturally defined as the worldvolume
theory of M5-branes in the presence of a 3-form -field
with two legs along the worldvolume and one leg transverse
to it.(
We note also that the theory on the NS5-branes studied in the
previous section could have tensor nonlocality parameters
given by RR -form field strengths for .)  To find the
corresponding supergravity solution we can start from
a  brane solution and then lift it to 11-dimensional 
supergravity and send the radius of the  direction to infinity,
. In this limit, setting ,
one finds :
ds_11 ^2&=& h^-1/3 [  
f^-1/3 (  dt^2-h(dx_4^2+dx_5^2)) &&
&+& f^2/3 
( dr^2+r^2dd-hr^4l_p^6 (d)^2 
 ) ] ,&&_a=2 ^4C_45a dx^a&& hr^2l_p^6 d,
where
f1+N l_p^3 r^3 , h^-1 1+r^2l_p^6 .
The decoupling limit of the theory is defined as a limit where 
 keeping  fixed. In this limit,
setting  as
0&0&0&0&00&0&L &0&00&-L &0&0&00&0&0&0&L 0&0&0&-L &0 ,

to preserve 8 supercharges, the above supergravity solution reads
l_s^2ds^2&=& h^-13  [ u (N)^1/3  
( dt^2 - dx_1^2 - +dx_3^2- 
h(dx_4^2+dx_5^2) ) &&
 &-& (N)^23   u^2  ( du^2 + u^2 d _3^2 - 
 h u^4 ^2 
(a_2d_2 +a_3 d_3 + a_4d _4)^2 )] ,&&_a=2 ^4C_45_a d_a&=& h u^2(a_2d _2 +
 a_3 d_3+a_4 d_4) ,
 
where  and
 are angular coordinates 
parameterizing the
sphere  transverse to the brane and 's are given
by 
a_2_3,
a_3-_2 _2_3,
a_4^2 _2 ^2 _3 .
The effective "discpole " is also defined by 
LeffDP 
2= 2L  _1
where  has dimension of .

It is also possible to find a lightlike discpole  theory by making
use of a boost in the  direction. Consider a boost in the 
direction given by () and (). In the limit
 and taking into account
the finiteness of the lightlike dipole [requirement ()], one finds
ds^2&=&u(N)^1/3  (-dx^+dx^-+^24 
u^2(dx^+)^2-dx_1^2-&& 
&-&(N)^2/3 u^2 (du^2+u^2d_4^2),&&_a=2 ^4C_+4_a d_a&=-& 2 u^2(a_2d _2 +
 a_3 d_3+a_4 d_4) ,
where  is the finite -dependent
magnitude of the lightlike dipole.
Note that in the large boost limit we have  while
 is kept fixed.

To study the nonlocal structure of the theory it would be useful to
study the expectation values of Wilson loops/surfaces in the theory. 
In the next section we will study the Wilson loops/surfaces in the
theories we have studied so far using the corresponding supergravity
solutions.

The nondecoupling of the center  

But before we proceed let us discuss the  center of the gauge group.
In the local  Super-Yang-Mills theory the traces
of the gauge field, scalars and fermions (viewed as  matrices)
decouple from the rest of the Lagrangian which describes an 
gauge theory. This decoupling has also been demonstrated in the 
supergravity dual.
On the other hand, it is well known that in noncommutative  
gauge theories the traces of the fields do not decouple. 
On the supergravity dual this has been explained inas a consequence of a nonzero 3-form NSNS flux and a term of
the form  in the bulk 
type-IIB supergravity.
Here  and  are the 3-form NSNS and 5-form RR field strengths.
In the supergravity dual of noncommutative
Yang-Mills theorythe field strengths are oriented in such a way that turning on
a nonzero  in the direction perpendicular to the noncommutativity
costs energy and this is related to the energy of electric fluxes.

What happens in dipole theory?
The  gauge field does not decouple but, unlike noncommutative
Young-Mills theory, the dipole theory is well defined for an 
gauge group. Therefore, the question arises which gauge group does
the supergravity dual describe?
Here again there is a nonzero  but it has a component in the
direction of the  and therefore if  has no legs in
the direction of the  then
.
This suggests that the supergravity dual describes the dipole theory
with  rather than  gauge group.
This is just as well because the  dipole theory is probably 
ill-defined in the UV (see the -function calculations
in).

What about the trace of the scalars and fermions?
 In the local  Super-Yang-Mills it was
argued in that operators such as
 (using the notation of subsection ),
if they existed, would correspond to supergravity fields in 
 with
conformal dimension  and they would violate the
Breitenlohner-Freedman bound .
As explained there, this bound is related to the fact that
if the conformal dimension is too low
the corresponding supergravity mode converges too fast near
the boundary. The metric () behaves very differently from
 near the boundary  and therefore
the results about  do not apply.
In fact () has strong curvature for large  and the
supergravity approximation is not applicable near the boundary.

In the dipole theories the expression  is not gauge invariant
because  transforms as a product of a quark and anti-quark fields
at two different points. To make  gauge invariant one needs to
add an open Wilson line inside the trace. We will discuss such operators 
in more detail in section .

Closed Wilson loops and Wilson surfaces 

In this section we use the dual gravity description of nonlocal  
theories studied in the previous sections to compute the 
expectation values of Wilson loops for different theories.
According to the AdS/CFT 
correspondence the expectation value of the Wilson loop
of the gauge theory can be computed in the
dual string theory description by evaluating the partition function
of a string whose worldsheet is bounded by the loop
. 
In the supergravity approximation the dominant contribution comes from the 
minimal two dimensional surface bounded by the loop. 
The expectation value of the Wilson loop is
 W(C) e^-S ,
where S is the string action evaluated on
the minimal surface bounded by the loop .

Dipole theory 

The Wilson loop of  the dipole gauge theories living on the worldvolume 
of Dp-branes in the presence of nonzero B-field with one leg along the brane 
has been studied in using 
the supergravity solution ().
When the distance between a quark and 
an anti-quark is much bigger than their  dipole size,
their energy is given by
E-(^2 N l^2 )^1/(5-p) (1+
c_0^2
(^2 N l^2 )^2/(5-p) +),
where  is the  separation,  is a numerical 
constant and  is the effective dipole vector
defined in ().
The first term in the above expression is what we have 
in the ordinary gauge theory and the
second term can be interpreted as the dipole-dipole
interaction. Note that
in our computation leading to () we have kept fixed
the angular coordinates  which are involved in the definition
of  in ().
The angular variables are canonically dual to the R-symmetry charge
of the quark (and opposite charge of the anti-quark).
Keeping the angular variables fixed
translates to a fixed dipole electric moment for the quark and
anti-quark that is given by .

Discpole theory 

Let us now compute the Wilson surface of the discpole theory 
described by the supergravity solution ().
 From the Wilson surface the potential per unit length of two 
external straight string-like objects can be calculated.
To do this we recognize four different membrane configurations 
which we parameterize as follows
 
	
 at =constant.
	
	
 at =constant.
	
	
 at =constant.
	
	
 at =constant.

Four different orientations of the membrane in .
The nonlocality is in directions  

Here the membrane worldvolume is parametrized by  and
. The configurations are depicted in figure .
We are interested in the action per unit  area.
We therefore consider a finite piece of the membrane given by
 and . In the supergravity approximation
the action should be proportional to .
For the case (1) the membrane action
S=1(2)^2l_p^3 d^3-(G_ _aX^ 
_bX^ ) ,
reads
S=TL'(2)^2 dxu^3R^3 +(_xu)^2 
which is exactly the same as that considered in. 
Therefore one finds
EL' -Nl^2 
where  is the distance between two external string-like objects of the
theory.
This means that when the external objects are perpendicular to the
 plane (the two nonlocality directions) and the plane that passes
through the object intersects the 4-5 plane in a line (the  direction)
as represented by
membrane configuration in case (1) the force between them is
is not sensitive to the dipole deformation effect.

For the other cases, the membrane actions read

 
	Case 2 
S=TL'(2)^2 dxu^3R^3 +(1+u^2^2)
(_xu)^2 .
	Case 3 
S=TL'(2)^2 dx(1+u^2^2)(u^3R^3 +
(_xu)^2) .
Case 4 
S=TL'(2)^2 dxu^3/R^31+u^2^2 +
(_xu)^2 .
The above formulas use the effective discpole  defined in
(). 
Using the same method as the energy as the function of 
 for all cases is given by
QQAllCases 
EL' -Nl^2 (1+c_0^i
(N)^2l^4 ),
where  are some numerical constants which, of course,
depend on 
the case number ( or )
that we are considering. The first term in the above expression is the
normal interaction between external object in the (2,0) theory. The
second term can be interpreted as the discpole interaction between the 
objects. So the corresponding object represented by the membrane 
configuration given by cases 2-4 in addition to the normal 
interaction have discpole-discpole interaction as well. Therefore the
corresponding states must have discpole moment. 

Lightlike dipole theory 

Now we would like to study the potential of the  
system for the lightlike dipole theory using the corresponding
supergravity solution ().
We parameterize the string configuration by 
 for fixed . We also keep fixed the
angular coordinates which  are involved in the definition of
. In this parameterization, using the supergravity 
solution (), the string action 
S= 1 2 l_s^2  
d d -( G_  
_i X^  _j X^  ) . 
reads
S= T 2 2  dxu (u/R)^7-p  
+(_xu)^2 .
Here we used the lightlike theory's 
defined in equation ().
 From the form of the action we find that 
despite the fact that the theory is non-local,
the end-points of the string can be fixed at 
large . We note that in the noncommutative gauge theory
where we have a non-zero B field with both legs along
the brane worldvolume we have a problem fixing the end-points 
, though we could fix it using a moving 
frame.

The action () is minimized when

u(u/R)^7-p  (u/R)^7-p  
+(_xu)^2  =u_0(u_0R )^(7-p)/2 ,
where  is the point where . 
This equation can be solved for , and from that
the  separation is found to be
l2 x(u)= R^(7-p)/2  
u_0^(5-p)/2  _1 ^ dy y^(7-p)/2 
y^9-p -1  .
Using () we can calculate the
energy of the  system as follows
E=4 u_0^2[ _1^ dy
( y^11-p  y^9-p -1  -y) -12 
] 
Here we subtracted the infinity coming from mass of the 
W-boson which corresponds to string stretching all 
the way to . 

Therefore the energy as a function of  is obtained
QQELL 
E-4 (g_YM ^2N l^2 )^2/(5-p) .
This means that the objects' interaction with each other is only due to 
the lightlike dipoles they are carrying.

Lightlike discpole theory 

Now we would like to study the Wilson surface in the discpole theory
described by the supergravity solution (). Consider an open 
membrane solution in the background () parameterizing as 
following
x^+=,x_1=_1,x_2=_2x,u=u(x),
x^-=constant .

Using the lightlike discpole theory's 
defined after equation () we find that
the membrane action for this configuration is given by
S=TL'(2)^2 2 dxu 
u^3R^3 +(_xu)^2 ,
which is minimized when
u^4/R^3 u^3R^3 +(_xu)^2  
=constant =u_0^5/2 R^3/2  .
Here  is the point where .
This equation can be solved for  and thereby
the separation between two external objects is given by
l2 x(u)=
R^3/2 u_0^1/2  _1 ^ 
dy y^3/2 y^5-1  .
Performing the integral one finds
l= 2(3 5 ) 5(1 10 ) 
R^3 u_0   = 
(0.55)2R^3/2 u_0^1/2  .



Using the expression for the membrane action we can calculate the 
energy of the system as

EL' =2 (2)^2 u_0^2
[ _1 ^ dy(y^7/2  
y^5-1  -y)-12 ] .
Performing the integral one finds
EL' 





= -(0.14)2 (2)^2 u_0^2





 From () and () we get
QQELLDP 
EL' =-(0.1)4 N^2l^4 .
Similarly to the lightlike dipole theory, this shows that the external
objects of the lightlike discpole deformation of the (2,0) theory 
interact with each other only because of the lightlike discpole moment 
they are carrying. We note, however, that this is only the effect of
the infinite boost. In the undeformed (2,0) theory the 
string-like objects interact because of their charges,
while in the spacelike discpole deformation of the (2,0) theory the objects'
interaction has contributions
both from the charges and from the discpole moments that they are carrying.

Nonlocality in the large  limit 

In this section we will examine how the nonlocality of the field theories
is manifested in the boundary of the supergravity duals.
In the case of the dipole theories we will show that the boundary of
the supergravity dual is better viewed as
a fibration of  over an internal space 
rather than simply .
 is obtain by applying T-duality along 3 internal directions in .
In general the fibration
has a singular locus but away from that locus the fibration is
smooth and has a structure group that is generated by a finite number
of translations in . The translation vectors can be identified
with the dipole-vectors of the theory. It means that pairs of points
in  that are separated by an integral product
of a dipole-vector are connected by a path through .
This is depicted in figure  where  is 
a compact direction in .

 
The boundary of the nonlocal dipole theory is a fibration
of the  (horizontal) direction over an internal  (vertical)
direction with identification of points separated by . 
This picture was demonstrated infor a special case and 
we will show this in subsection  for the general
dipole theory.

Another aspect of the nonlocality of the dipole theories is
the existence of open Wilson lines  depicted in figure .
Consider a field  with dipole vector .
Let  be an open path from  
to  where  is a positive integer.
We can define the gauge invariant operator
OpenWL 
W(C)=P e^i_C A 
(x )(x +2)(x +2n) .
Since  is proportional to the R-charge
a generic gauge invariant operator with R-charge 
must have an open Wilson line with the opening proportional to
the R-charge.

 
Open Wilson line with R-charge.
The opening is a vector in the  direction with
length proportional to the R-charge. 

Moving on to the generalized nonlocal theories,
we conjecture that there are operators with R-charge
that correspond to open manifolds.
For example, consider the discpole theory which is a nonlocal
deformation of the  theory.
The  theory is believed to have Wilson surface  operators,
that is, operators that correspond to closed surfaces.
Consider the nonlocal deformation that assigns an area in the 
plane to R-charge. Such a theory, we conjecture, will have operators
that correspond to open surfaces.  A typical open-Wilson-surface operator
has a  boundary that lies in a single plane
parallel to the  directions.
Such a surface is depicted in figure .
By analogy with the open Wilson lines of dipole theories,
the area of the opening will be proportional to the R-charge of
the operator.
Presumably, such operators can have a disconnected boundary 
where each  is a curve on a plane of constant 
and the sum
of the (signed) areas bounded by all the 's is proportional to the
R-charge.

Nonlocality in dipole theories 

We parameterize the matrix of dipole vectors , defined in 
subsection , as the matrix
hMgeneric 
( )
The parameters  are the dipole lengths of the 
scalar fields. The dipole lengths of the fermionic fields are
_1 && (L_1 -L_2 -L_3),_2 (L_2 -L_1 -L_3),_3 (L_3 -L_1 -L_2),


_4 && (L_1 +L_2 +L_3) = -(_1 + _2 + _3).
To see how all these distances appear as the nonlocality parameters
we start with 
the metric and NSNS -field in equation () for .
We can parameterize  as a  fibration over ,
as in,









with  where
 parameterize the base .
The metric and B-field () can now be written as
 -1  ds^2  &=& u^2 R^2 
     (dt^2 -dx_1 ^2  - dx_2 ^2  
-dx_3^2 1+u^2_i=1 ^3 L_i^2 _i^2 )
-R^2 (d_2^2 +du^2 u^2 )

 &&
-R^2 _i=1 ^3 _i^2 d_i^2 
-u^2 1+u^2_i=1 ^3 L_i^2 _i^2 
  (_i=1 ^3 L_i _i^2 d_i)^2,


B &=& 
u^2 1+u^2_i=1 ^3 L_i^2 _i^2 
  _i=1 ^3 L_i _i^2 d_idx_3,

e^2  &=& 
g_s^2 1+u^2_i=1 ^3 L_i^2 _i^2 .
Here  is the metric on the base .
For simplicity let us work with lightlike dipole vectors.
The background () is replaced by:
 -1 ds^2  &=& u^2 R^2 
     dx^+ dx^-  -dx_1 ^2  - dx_2 ^2  
-u^2 4 (_i=1 ^3 L_i^2 _i^2)(dx^+ )^2

 &&
-R^2 (du^2 u^2 
+d_2^2 +_i=1 ^3 _i^2 d_i^2 ),


B &=& 
u^2 _i=1 ^3 L_i _i^2 d_idx^+ ,

e^2  &=& g_s^2.
Next we perform T-duality on the fiber .
The metric () has an isometry 
but for each  the isometry  acts as
. It multiplies the fermion fields by
 because the isometry has fixed points near which
it acts as a  rotation of the tangent plane.
Because of the  T-duality acts somewhat differently than
in the usual case. It takes us from type-IIB to type 0A
and the T-dual  is smaller by a factor of .
More precisely, let  be the momentum
generators along the circles parameterized by .
The circles have radii .
For the purpose of obtaining the exact T-dual background
we can double the radii to make them 
and then restrict to states for which
FPPP 
(-)^F e^i P_1 
=(-)^F e^i P_2 
=(-)^F e^i P_3  = 1.
after T-duality we get type-IIA with the background
-1 ds^2  &=& u^2 R^2 
     dx^+ (dx^-  -1 2 _i L_i d_i) -dx_1 ^2  - dx_2 ^2 

 &&
-R^2 (du^2 u^2 
+d_2^2)
-1 4R^2 _i=1 ^3 d_i^2 _i^2 

 &&
Here  are coordinates on the dual 
with the identifications ,
but we have to augment the background with the T-dual of
the projection ():
FWWW 
(-)^F e^i W_1 
=(-)^F e^i W_2 
=(-)^F e^i W_3  = 1.
Here  are string winding numbers.
This means that permissible string states have winding numbers
that satisfy



and the state is fermionic if all  are odd
and bosonic if all  are even.
 From this it follows that the compactification is
actually type-0A and the  fibers are the spaces
parameterized by  with the identifications





We can define




The metric () is then simply
-1 ds^2  &=& u^2 R^2 
d^- d^+  -dx_1 ^2  - dx_2 ^2 
-R^2 (du^2 u^2 
+d_2^2)
-1 4R^2 _i=1 ^3 d_i^2 _i^2 .

 &&
It describes the  direction as fibered
over the  in such a way that  
is accompanied by 
with  all odd or all even.
The full identification should therefore be
(_1,_2,_3,^+ ) &&

R-charge is conserved in dipole theories.
Unlike a mass deformation of SYM which can classically preserve
some R-symmetry but quantum mechanically instanton effects break
the classical symmetry, the classical R-symmetry that is preserved
by a dipole deformation cannot be broken by instantons.
This is because the remaining R-symmetry is a geometrical rotation
symmetry in the string theory realization.
With the generic dipole vectors given in () the
unbroken symmetry is .
Consider now a correlation function 
 of open Wilson lines
 as in ().
Let the openings of the Wilson lines be given by the vectors
. 
(See figure  for an example.)
Because of R-charge conservation we need to have 




  

(150,50)
    

(230,70)
    
Correlation function of open Wilson lines.
It can be nonzero if  
In the supergravity dual () each open Wilson line corresponds
to a closed curve on the boundary. 
It is constructed from the open curve by closing it through
the extra  directions.
Two points  whose  coordinates differ by  and whose
remaining coordinates, including  are identical
can be connected by a microscopic path through the
 dimensions (see Figure ).

  

(130,60)  







In the supergravity dual, an open Wilson line actually
closes through the extra -dimension along the path
. The dashed lines connect points that are identified. 
Using the metric ()
we see that the distance 
between the points  and  through the -direction
along the path  in figure ()
is of the order of  whereas the proper
length of a curve between  and  with fixed 
 is of the order of
 as .
Thus, the shortcut  through the internal  directions
has negligible length compared to the rest of the Wilson line.

According to the prescription of we have
to complete the closed Wilson loop to a surface into the bulk.
In principle, one has to perform a path integral over all worldsheets
in the bulk with the given boundary conditions but in the case
of the local  SYM theory, and for generic, sufficiently smooth
Wilson loops the path integral is dominated
by a single classical configuration as in.
This was also the case inand in section where we studied operators without R-charge.

What would be the analogous prescription for calculating Open Wilson lines in
the large  limit of the nonlocal dipole theory?
Suppose we are given an open path  on ,
as the one from  to  in figure ,
with the opening proportional to one of the dipole vectors .
we can close the path  to make it a closed loop by connecting
the two endpoints with a straight line through the -direction.
Let us denote by  the extra path that closes the loop.
Now that we have a closed loop we can do the path integral
over worldsheets in the bulk whose boundary is the closed loop.
However, since the metric in the -direction does not
have the prefactor  [see ()]
we cannot treat  as classical.
We have to take into account the fluctuations of ,
but only in the  directions
and not in the  directions.
This is because
an arbitrarily small deformation of  in the
 directions will change the proper length
of the path, using the metric (), by terms of
order  on the boundary.
This is just as well, since if  could fluctuate into
the  directions the expectation value of the Wilson
line would not have depended on the path  which would be absurd!
Also, the metric components in the directions of  
are of the order of  and are assumed large.

Note also that the closed loop 
has nonzero winding number around
some of the -directions. This is in accord with the
equivalence between winding number and R-symmetry charge.
Thus, we have a well-defined prescription for the 
correlation function of open Wilson lines as in figure .
To calculate the correlation function
in the large  limit we invoke a Born-Oppenheimer approximation
where we first fix the 
coordinates of the worldsheet with the appropriate boundary conditions.
We then treat  quantum mechanically 
and find the quantum partition function of these fields on the string
worldsheet. We can take Dirichlet boundary conditions for
 so as to fix the winding numbers in these
directions on the boundary.

The open worldsheet connecting two open 
Wilson lines,  and , can be closed with an extra piece
of microscopic action (depicted by the dashed pattern). 


To leading order in  we can ignore the coordinates
 and consider only the coordinates 
 that describe 
(see figure ).
The prescription for calculating
the correlation function



of open Wilson lines
 is then as follows.

Consider all possible surfaces 
such that the intersection of the boundary  of 
and  is .  is also allowed to have
a boundary  in the bulk but it is restricted in
the following way.
For every 
let  be the submanifold  in .
It has the geometry of . It intersects
the boundary of  on a collection of open paths




where the number  of disconnected paths can depend on 
because as we vary  paths can split or join.
The restriction on  is that for every 
the endpoints of each open path  should be separated by
an integer product of the dipole vector .
If there are several dipole vectors the separation should
be a linear combination of the dipole vectors with integer coefficients.
We also require that for  small enough   which means
that all the paths have joined together and therefore
 is either a union of closed loops or the empty set.
We now have to find the minimum area of all allowed 's.
To leading order in this approximation






Example 

As an example we will calculate the correlation function 
 where  and  are
straight segments of length .
To be specific we take
W(x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3)  

 &&

P e^-i_- ^0 A_3(x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3 - t L) dt 
Z(x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3)
P e^i_0^  A_3(x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3 + t L) dt  

 &&
and we assume that  is an appropriate
(complex) linear combination of the 6 scalars 
with a dipole vector of length  in the  direction.
We will calculate 



For this purpose we find a surface whose boundary contains the
two segments  and  (see figure ).


)  

Correlation function of two Open Wilson lines 
. The strip is an open worldsheet in the 
 space. 

The surface is in the space of  but
the minimal area of such a surface depends only on the projection onto
the space perpendicular to the  direction.
We will assume that  are constant along  and
that  along  and we will parameterize 
so that  is the point of  with the smallest value of 
and that .
Using the metric () we see that the area of  is then
Area)  (S) &=&
2 L _u_0 ^u R y' ^2 + R^4 u^4   du.
This is exactly the same integral that appears in the calculation of
the quark anti-quark potential.
After regularization as in we 
obtain the result




where  denotes terms that are subleading when  is large.
We are also assuming  for the following reason.
 is a strip with width .
At the points of  where  is smallest the proper length of the strip
is of the order of



where we used the results of to estimate
. If the width of the strip is smaller than 
 we have to include
the contribution of the fluctuations in the  directions
which is a boundary effect on the strip .

When   we can assume that  is small.
For small  the Lagrangian of the dipole theory can be written
as a small deformation of the Lagrangian of  SYM with gauge group
 plus 6 free scalar fields and 4 free Dirac fermions.
The extra free fields come about because a generic field  with
dipole vector  transforms in the  representation
of 
where  is the group at spacetime point .
In the limit  we find that the field 
transforms in the reducible  representation which decomposes
into the adjoint representation and a singlet.

In the limit  the leading contribution to the open Wilson line 
will be the singlet  [see ()].
 is a free field of conformal dimension . We therefore expect






Lightcone quantization of strings in the gravity duals
of lightlike dipole theories 

In order to extend the discussion to the generalized theories,
we would like to find the explanation for nonlocality
in terms of the original background ().
A major simplification occurs in the light-like
case () when the Wilson loops are at constant .

We will use the lightcone formalism for strings in 
as presented in-.(
We wish to thank Andrei Mikhailov for pointing this out.) 
Equation (21) of describes the lightcone Hamiltonian

fermions  and  that are also chiral  spinors.
Their components are denoted by  and  ()
with  and . The Dirac matrices
 satisfy  and
.
The primes over ,  and  
denote differentiation with respect to the worldsheet coordinate .
As is standard in lightcone gauge, the coordinate  can be found
by integrating
xminus 
^-  = -1 p^+  (__+_K^K)
-i 2 (^i_i +^i_i+_i^i +_i^i).
It is easy to extend () to the gravity dual of the lightlike
dipole theory
[() with ].
When comparing () to () we identify
 and .
The extra terms to add to () are the contribution of a 
 term in the metric 
and an  NSNS B-field . We obtain
the total contribution
H _1 =
p^+  2 (Y^Y + Y^)
+(fermions  ).
Here we used the gauge fixing  
and  (see)
where  are worldsheet coordinates and  is the
worldsheet metric.
The expression () for  remains the same.

The extra terms () can be absorbed by a redefinition
Y  e^i Y ,e^i ,e^i .
In the equation for ,  should be taken as a  matrix
in the fundamental representation of  and in the equations
for  and ,  should be taken as a  matrix in
the spinor representation of .
After the substitution () the lightcone Hamiltonian
has the same form as () except that the fields  and 
are no longer periodic in . Instead
Y (+p^+ ,) &=& 
  e^i p^+  Y (,),

(+p^+ ,)&=& 
  e^i p^+  (,),(+p^+ ,)= e^i p^+  (,).
After the redefinition () the
expression () for  becomes:
^-  &=& -1 p^+  (__+_K^K)
-i 2 (^i_i +^i_i+_i^i +_i^i)

 &-&

Note that the second line of () can be written as
 where

 R-symmetry worldsheet current.
We now define  as
()  &&
_0^-1 p^+  (__+_K^K)
-i 2 (^i_i +^i_i+_i^i +_i^i)
.
This is the same expression in terms of oscillators as ()
but written in terms of the new variables 
[i.e. after the transformation ()].
The new coordinate  is not single valued and satisfies
wxminbc 
(+ p^+ ) - () =

The RHS of () is exactly the expected dipole length of the
corresponding open Wilson operator.
The prescription for calculating correlation functions
of open Wilson lines in the lightlike dipole theory is as follows.
Assume that  () is an open curve in the null plane of 
 and at constant .
The correlation function  can be 
calculated from the string amplitude to propagate from 
the string state corresponding to 
at 
to the string state corresponding to  at .
The string state corresponding to  is such that the worldsheet fields
 trace out  as 
and . The state is also required to have
the specified R-charge corresponding to its dipole vector opening.
Note that in this prescription we use the  Hamiltonian
 given in equation () and not the deformed one
().






















































Open Wilson surfaces in generalized twisted theories 

Similarly, we can discuss correlation functions of open Wilson
surfaces in discpole theories.
Since the total R-charge of an expression
 must be zero, the sum of 
the areas of the openings in the surfaces must be zero.
(Note that the surfaces are oriented and the areas are therefore signed.)

In more general twisted theories we expect to find operators
that are parameterized by manifolds with a boundary.
For example, in the theories that are obtained by probing
the background 



given by equations ()-() (with ),
we expect to find operators that are parameterized by
-dimensional manifolds with -dimensional boundaries
that are restricted to be in a -dimensional hyperplane
that is parallel to .


Open Wilson surfaces from the SUGRA dual 

In subsection () we explained the nonlocality
of the dipole theory using T-dual variables.
However, an attempt to explain the nonlocality of the discpole
theories along similar lines fails as we shall now see.
Referring to equation (),
we can write  as a  fibration over a base
 (with a ring of singular fibers),








with  where
 parameterize the base .
We will take a generic
hMDPgen 
( )
The supersymmetric case () is .
The metric and -field () can now be rewritten as
 l_p^-2  ds^2  &=& u R^1 2   
     (dx_+ dx_-  -dx_1 ^2  - dx_2 ^2  - dx_3 ^2  
-dx_4^2 + dx_5^2 1+u^2_i=1 ^2 L_i^2 _i^2 )

C &=& 
u^2 1+u^2_i=1 ^2 L_i^2 _i^2 
  _i=1 ^2 L_i _i^2 d_idx_4dx_5,where we defined .
Let us make a few observations about this metric.
Set 



For fixed  the coordinates 
describe a  with metric given by
ds^2 &=& R^2 (u,y)^2 (1+u^2 L_2^2_2^2)_1^2 d_1^2
+(1+u^2 L_1^2_1^2)_2^2 d_2^2
+ 2 u^2 L_1 L_2 _1^2_2^2 d_1 d_2
.

 &&
This  has area and complex structure:







We are interested in the behavior of the metric near the boundary
.
In that limit
for generic  (i.e. away from the singular ring)
we have . Therefore the area of the  shrinks
to zero on the boundary and the complex structure  becomes real.
A duality to type-IIB is not helpful because because real  is
a singular limit of type-IIB. The origin of nonlocality therefore remains
mysterious!






















































Discussion 
We have argued that many field theories that are realized on branes
have a rich class of deformations that break Lorentz invariance and
locality. Super-Yang-Mills theory has a "dipole deformation" for which
the nonlocality is parameterized by vectors, the  theory
has a "discpole deformation" for which the nonlocality is parameterized
by 2-forms and little string theory has various deformations parameterized
by vectors, 3-forms, or 5-forms in type-IIB 
[corresponding to the cases  in () respectively]
and by 2-forms and 4-forms in type-IIA
[corresponding to the cases  in () respectively].
We have studied the large  limit supergravity duals of these deformed
field theories and we have seen that they simplify when the deformation
parameters are lightlike.
We have analyzed Wilson loops and surfaces in the corresponding theories
and we calculated the quark anti-quark potentials for the gauge theories
and string anti-string tensions for the  theory.
The contribution of the (vector or tensor)
deformation to the potential can be clearly
seen as a subleading term in (),().
In the case of a lightlike deformation
we were able to isolate the signature of the deformation
as the leading contribution
to the potential of a certain
(quark or stringlike) object anti-object configuration
[see equations (),()].

The deformed theories also have open Wilson lines and (presumably)
open Wilson surfaces.
We calculated simple correlation functions of the open Wilson lines.
Here again there is a simplification for the lightlike deformations.
We showed that the worldsheet lightcone
Hamiltonian of a string in the supergravity
dual of the deformed (dipole) theory is essentially identical to 
the worldsheet lightcone Hamiltonian for (undeformed) 
[see equation ()]. The only difference is in the boundary conditions
on the fields [see equations (),()].
These modified boundary conditions also explain the nonlocality in the
theory and the opening in the Wilson lines.
Understanding the nonlocality of the tensor deformations of the 
and little string theories still remains a challenge!

A brief review of dipole theories 
For the sake of being self-contained we will present a brief review
of dipole theories. We refer the reader to
for more details.

The dipole theories are nonlocal gauge field theories that are also
not Lorentz invariant.
The gauge group can be either  or . 
For the  gauge group the field contents the same as
that of  Super-Yang-Mills theory but the Lagrangian
is different in the following way.

First we need a constant (R-symmetry) -valued space-time vector .
Similarly to the definition of Super-Yang-Mills theory on a noncommutative
-,
we modify the product of two fields  
at the spacetime point  to






Here  is the operator R-symmetry charge which takes values in
.  is the Killing form on  and
the -valued product 
denotes the scalar product of  and 
as spacetime vectors.
The -product is associative if all  -valued components
of the spacetime vector  commute.
We now replace all products with -products.

Note that if  is a field such that
, with  a constant 
spacetime vector, we say that  has dipole-vector  .
This is justified by the expression for the covariant derivative







 From the Lagrangian of the  dipole theory one can obtain
the  dipole theory by freezing the gauge field corresponding
to the  center of the gauge group. Note, however, that we
cannot impose the tracelessness condition on the scalar
and spinor field combinations with nonzero dipole vectors.
For example, a field  with dipole vector 
does not transform in the adjoint representation
of the gauge group but rather in the  representation
of the product group 
where  is the gauge group at the spacetime point .
