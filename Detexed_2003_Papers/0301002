Universality classes for horizon instabilities 

 
Steven S. Gubser and Arkadas Ozakin 





 
Abstract 

 We introduce a notion of universality classes for the Gregory-Laflamme
instability and determine, in the supergravity approximation, the
stability of a variety of solutions, including the non-extremal
D3-brane, M2-brane, and M5-brane.  These three non-dilatonic branes
cross over from instability to stability at a certain non-extremal
mass.  Numerical analysis suggests that the wavelength of the shortest
unstable mode diverges as one approaches the cross-over point from
above, with a simple critical exponent which is the same in all three
cases.

Introduction 

The Gregory-Laflamme instability has been
conjectured to arise precisely when local thermodynamic instabilities
exist, for horizons with infinite extent and a translational symmetry
.  The idea is that, barring finite volume effects
or some unexpected consequences of a curved horizon, the horizon will
tend to become lumpy through real-time dynamics precisely if it can
gain entropy by doing so.  Based on this line of thinking, one might
poetically ascribe the dynamical stability of the Schwarzschild black
hole in four dimensions merely to the fact that the horizon is smaller
in total size than the shortest wavelength instability.

A fairly thorough analysis in, exploiting a connection
between time-independent, finite-wavelength perturbations in
Lorentzian signature and negative modes in Euclidean signature, gives
considerable confidence that the conjecture of is
correct, as well as making clearer the reasons why thermodynamic and
dynamical stability should be connected.  The analysis ofdoes leave several points open, including the following:
  
  For the black brane solutions familiar from string theory, just
when is stability lost?
  What happens near the threshold of stability?
  Once an instability develops, what does the system evolve
into?
 Question 3) has been the subject of recent scrutiny for the case of
uncharged black branes (see for instance
).  Question 1) is straightforward
if one grants the analysis of, since one needs only
compute the specific heat as a function of non-extremality.  We will
address the question in section  from this thermodynamic
point of view, and in section  by directly searching for
time-independent, finite-wavelength perturbations, thus providing an
independent check on the validity of the analysis of.  We
will also make a start on question 2), based on our numerics.  In
section  we will introduce a notion of universality
classes for black brane horizons, based on solutions described in
.  For the questions we will address, a single characteristic
exponent defines a universality class: this exponent describes how
horizon entropy scales with temperature.

Our notion of universality classes is of some intuitive use in
understanding the stability properties of various charged brane
solutions.  In particular, the well-known non-extremal D-branes of
type II string theory interpolate between one universality class far
from extremality (where the entropy scales as a negative power of
temperature, and Gregory-Laflamme instabilities exist) to a different
universality class near extremality (where entropy scales as a
positive power of temperature, and Gregory-Laflamme instabilities
probably do not exist).

Other recent work on the Gregory-Laflamme instability includes
.  In particular,explores the stability of charged brane solutions, using methods
somewhat different from ours, but with conclusions that overlap and
agree with those in section .



Thermodynamic considerations 

The D-brane solutions to type II string theory have the following
string frame metric and dilaton:
  SMetric 
   ds^2 &= G_tt  dt^2 + G_rr  dr^2 + G_  d_n+1 ^2 +
            G_yy  dy^i dy^i         &= -h f   dt^2 + f  h  dr^2 +
           f  r^2 d_n+1 ^2 +
           1 f   dy^i dy^i    e^2   &= f^(n-4)/2 
   
where
  HandF 
   h = 1 - r_0^n r^n     f = 1 + r_0^n ^2 r^n  .
   
The string metric  is related to the Einstein metric
 by .  In
equations  and , .  We will assume throughout
that the metric  is being used to describe a large number
 of coincident D-branes, so that the supergravity
approximation is reliable (except perhaps near the horizon at
extremality, where some of the solutions have a null singularity).

The thermodynamic properties of D-branes are well-known, so we will
present here only a brief summary.  The original literature, including
, can be consulted for further details.  The entropy
of the D-brane solution  is
  BekHawk 
   S = A_Einstein  4 G_N  =
    A_string  4 G_N e^2   =
    4 _n+1  2 ^2  V r_0^n+1  ,
   
where  is the horizon area measured using the
Einstein frame metric,  is the horizon area in the
string frame metric,  is the coordinate volume in the 
directions, and  is the volume of the sphere :
 SphereVol 
  _m = S^m = 2 ^m+1 2     ( m+1 2  )  .
  
If one compactified the  on a torus whose volume at infinity was
, then  would be the total entropy of the resulting
horizon.  The ADM mass (most easily calculated using the Einstein
frame metric) is
  ADMMass 
   M = _n+1  V 2 ^2  r_0^n
    ( n+2 2  + n 2  2) .
   
The temperature can be extracted from the surface gravity:
 Tcl 
  T = 2   = 1 2 
   . g_tt  / r 2 g_tt  g_rr   
    _r=r_0  = n 4 r_0   .
  
One can substitute  and  for  and  in
, provided the dilaton is non-singular at the horizon (which would
just mean that the horizon is a null singularity, and that only
happens for extremal D-branes).

It is straightforward to check that .

The D-brane charge is quantized, and can be expressed in terms of the
following constraint:
  QuantRA 
   R ^n 1 2   r_0^n 2=
    2 ^2 n _n+1   N_p _p
    = N_p  2^2 (2 )^7-2p  (3-p          n _n+1  
    = (2 )^n n _n+1   g N_p ,
   
where  is an integer and  is the tension of a single
extremal D-brane, and we have used the relation
  NewtonG 
   16 G_N = 2 ^2 = (2)^7 g^2 (,
   
valid in uncompactified type II string theory.  The formula ,
taken from, can be checked against the standard formula for
D-brane tension:
  DTension 
   2 ^2 _p^2 = (2 )^7-2p  (3-p  .
   

Holding  fixed, the behavior of the temperature in different
limits is well known.  In all cases,  in the small 
limit, since this is the large mass limit where the charge is
negligible.  For , and ,  also in the extremal
limit, whereas for ,  approaches a constant, and for ,
 diverges.  There are no other remarkable qualitative features of
the dependence of  on mass other than a consequence of what we have
already said: for , there is a special mass  where 
reaches a global maximum.  This is the border of thermodynamic
stability: for masses less than , the specific heat is positive,
and for masses greater than  it is negative.  Holding 
fixed, one finds that  is extremized when
 AlphaStr 
  ^2= ^2_* = 1n-2  ,
  
or alternatively when
 Mratio 
  M N_p _p V  = M_* N_p _p V  = 
   n^2-2 nn-1  
  
(note that  is the extremal mass).  Another
characterization of the same condition is
 rzeroStr 
  r_0 = r_0^* = ( n-2 n-1   )^1/n  R  ,
  
where  is the length scale introduced in .

The M2 and M5-brane metrics are given by
 MtwoMfiveMetric 
  ds_M2 ^2 &= f_M2 ^-2/3 ( - h_M2  dt^2
    + dx_2 ^2 ) + f_M2 ^1/3 (dr^2 h_M2  
    + r^2 d_7^2 )    ds_M5 ^2 &= f_M5 ^-1/3 ( - h_M5  dt^2
    + dx_5 ^2 ) + f_M5 ^2/3 (dr^2 h_M5  
    + r^2 d_4^2 ) ,
  
where  and  are given by  with  for the M2-brane and
 for the M5-brane.  Indeed, the thermodynamics for the M2-brane
and the D1-brane are identical.  This is not accidental: wrapping an
M2-brane around a circle gives a fundamental string of type IIA, which
is equivalent through some further dualities to the D1-brane (and,
more to the point, has the same Einstein metric up to a slightly
different identification of parameters).  For similar reasons, the
M5-brane and D4-brane have the same thermodynamics.  In particular,
the condition for the maximum Hawking temperatures for the M2-brane
and the M5-brane are given precisely by , , and
, with  and , respectively.





Universality classes and the general problem 

A fairly broad statement of the question of -brane stability in the
supergravity approximation can be summed up as follows: starting with
some -brane solution in supergravity, one wishes to consider
perturbations that break some part of the translational invariance and
determine whether any of them grow with time.  Such considerations can
often be reduced to a problem in  dimensions, and in the
following paragraphs we shall give more particulars about how this
comes about.

One starts with a two-derivative action in  spacetime
dimensions, containing Einstein gravity and perhaps also form fields
and scalars.  The brane in question is some solution with a horizon
and a weakly curved region far from it (typically asymptotically flat
space), where the whole solution admits as symmetries the Euclidean
group of translations and rotations in 
dimensions.(Smaller symmetry groups can arise.  In
"smeared" brane solutions, for instance, composed of a density of
-branes distributed in several orthogonal directions, the symmetry
group would be translations in all dimensions plus a product of two
rotation groups for the directions parallel to and perpendicular to
the individual -branes.)   There should also be some Killing vector
which is timelike in the weakly curved region and null at the horizon,
which can be used to construct a notion of energy; and there may be
assorted spacelike Killing vectors as well, indicating rotational
symmetries.  The brane is of spatial co-dimension , and
far from the brane one generally expects an approximate
 rotational symmetry group.  The brane may have
various conserved charges and angular momenta (the latter
corresponding to generators of ).  In this rather
general context, we would like to ascertain the stability properties
of the solution against small perturbations (determined by
thermodynamic stability, according to),
perhaps also the dispersion relation for such perturbations, and
finally the end state of evolution along an unstable
direction-though this last is surely a much harder problem in
general than the other two.

Although we believe that the notion of universality classes we
introduce below will have some applicability to the general case
(including for example smeared brane solutions), let us focus on the
case where the  symmetry is exact.  Then
perturbations can be labeled uniquely by their wave-number 
along the brane and their angular momentum quantum numbers under
.  It seems reasonable to assume that the -wave
perturbations become unstable first, provided they exist as dynamical
perturbations (as opposed to being perturbations which are pure
gauge).  The perturbations in question thus preserve a large subgroup
of the symmetry of the original solution:  times that
part of the Euclidean group that preserves .  This makes it
particularly natural to consider a Kaluza-Klein "reduction" where
one integrates the action over an  orbit of
,(An interesting aside is that in
circumstances involving angular momentum, where obviously
 is not preserved even by the original solution,
Kaluza-Klein reduction is still often useful, with the somewhat
mysterious "consistent truncation" ansatze providing an exact
lower-dimensional account of both the solution and some low partial
wave perturbations.  We suspect that the
coincidences arising in consistent truncation that matter for analyses
of horizon perturbations arise from bosonic symmetries rather than
supersymmetry.)  and drops the integration over an 
perpendicular to .  The result is a 2+1-dimensional action,
which in a fairly broad set of circumstances can be brought into the
form
 Sgeneral 
  S = d^3 x  g  ( R - 1 2  G_ij ( )
   _^i ^^j - V( ) ) .
  
Einstein gravity, form fields, and scalars in  dimensions
reduce down to the type of action written in , plus perhaps
abelian and non-abelian gauge fields.  The abelian gauge fields can be
dualized to scalars, unless there are Chern-Simons terms in the
action. Non-abelian gauge fields in general cannot be dualized, but
examples in the literature often have fields excited corresponding to
an abelian subgroup.  Thus , while obviously not completely
general, does cover a broad range of cases.  Furthermore, it has been
observed that  is commonly a sum of
exponentials of canonically normalized scalars: for example, the
integrated curvature of  scales as a power of its
radius, but the canonically normalized scalar measuring the size of
 is some multiple of the logarithm of the radius.

In section  we will consider properties of
solutions to , in part recapitulating arguments of
.  In section  we briefly remark on the
reason to search for static perturbations.  Then in
section  we will make an explicit numerical study of
stability of a special case of the solutions considered in
section .



Solutions to gravity plus scalars 

Let us now study the slightly more general situation where 
 SanyD 
  S = d^D x  g  ( R - 1 2  G_ij ( )
   _^i ^^j - V( ) ) ,
  
where  is unrelated to .  Motivated by the previous
discussion, we will be most interested in the case .  Solutions
to the equations of motion of this action were studied in
, of the form
 SOoneone 
  ds^2 = a(r)^2 (-dt^2 + dx ^2) + dr^2 ,    =  (r) ,
  
with  a monotonically increasing function of , running from
 to .  The large  region in these solutions is weakly
curved (in fact, the main interest in was asymptotically
anti-de Sitter space), and the small  region is in most cases
singular.  These solutions have no horizons (or at best degenerate or
singular horizons), and their symmetry under boosts amounts to the
statement that they are extremal.  All such solutions can be derived
using a first order formalism (see for example
), which is a direct analog of
the Hamilton-Jacobi method of generating FRW cosmologies
: if one starts with an action of the same form as
, but in  dimensions, and finds  such that
 VW 
  V() = 12  G^ij  W ^i 
   W ^j  - 14  D-1 D-2 W^2 ,
  
then a solution to
 FirstOrder 
  ^i r 
    = - G^ij  W ^j  ,
   a / r a  
    = 12(D-2)  W( )
  
will also solve the equations of motion.

Non-extremal generalizations of  have the form
 NonEx 
  ds^2 = a(r)^2 (-h(r) dt^2 + dx ^2) + dr^2 h(r)  ,
     =  (r) .
  
We assume in general that  in the region where 
, and  everywhere.  If  and  is the
largest value of  for which this is true, then  is an event
horizon with respect to the region where  (which is
also at large ).  Provided , this is a
non-degenerate horizon with finite Hawking temperature.

Solutions of the form  involve a number of constants of
integration.  The counting of them has been explained in
, and we will recapitulate briefly here.  The relevant
equations of motion are all ordinary differential equations in 
once we assume the form .  They comprise the second order
equations for the scalars, of which we suppose there are ; the
 component of Einstein's equation, which is a first order
equation; and one further Einstein equation (for instance, the
combination  of Einstein's equations), which is
second order.  There are  integration constants altogether.  One
amounts to an additive shift in the radial variable , which is just
a coordinate transformation.  Another is fixed by the requirement that
 in the region where  is large.  The presence of a
non-degenerate horizon fixes  more, as explained in(one way to understand the presence of these  horizon constraints
is that in the Wick-rotated Euclidean solution, where the horizon
becomes a point, the scalars must be smooth everywhere, so their
radial derivatives must vanish at this point).  This leaves 
parameters that specify the solution.  One of these is the temperature
of the horizon, and the other  pertain to the asymptotics of the
scalars in the large  region.  Of these  parameters, some but
not all may be fixed by demanding regularity in the large  region.
In an  context, where the large  region is
asymptotically anti de-Sitter, the  parameters correspond to the
coefficients of  in the expansion of the
scalars around their constant limiting values as .
These coefficients amount on the CFT side to the mass parameters of
gauge singlet operators added to the lagrangian.  If some of the
operators in question are irrelevant, then the corresponding scalars
have positive , and the larger of the two solutions to the
linearized scalar equations of motion blows up at large : this is a
case where parameters are fixed to zero by demanding regularity in the
large  region.  In the case where the dual operators are relevant,
and the corresponding scalars have negative , then the
coefficient of  is truly a variable parameter.
In the case of asymptotically anti-de Sitter solutions, an additional
scaling symmetry can be used to eliminate one additional parameter:
this amounts to applying a scale transformation on the CFT side to
set, say, the temperature equal to .

Let us now consider the situation where the asymptotics of the scalars
is entirely fixed in the large  region, leaving us with one free
parameter.  One can show (see for the case where )
that
 hSolve 
  h = 1 - B _r^dr_1 a(r_1)^d  ,
  
and then  is the free parameter.  (The identity  holds even
though  may in general change when  changes.  It is a
convenient parametrization because the influence of  on  is
small in the large  region).  In an  context, this
would correspond to specifying a deformation of the gauge theory
lagrangian by relevant operators and then varying either the
temperature or the energy density.  Evidently, in the limit ,
one recovers a solution of the form .  Suppose that in this
limiting solution,  decreases monotonically as
 decreases, going to  as .(It is
possible that this condition could be relaxed somewhat: we must
certainly have  less than its limiting value at
large , and probably the monotonicity property is also needed for
 less than a certain upper bound.)   It can then be argued (though
not wholly rigorously) that
  
  Solutions with regular horizons exist for all .
  If  is the sum of exponentials of canonically
normalized scalars, then in the  solution, the scalars have an
asymptotic direction as : that is, 
 for some constants 
and , which we may normalize so that  is itself
canonically normalized.  Then 
 in the region of small .
  In near-extremal solutions, with sufficiently small , the
solution at small  is well-approximated by a Chamblin-Reall
solution for the exponent , which we explain below in
section .  The whole solution can be well-approximated by
the original extremal solution patched onto a Chamblin-Reall solution.
These approximations become progressively better as .
  The entropy and temperature of near-extremal solutions are
related by a power law: , where 
   alphagamma 
    = D-2 1 - 2 ^2(D-2)  .
    
 
These features suggest the notion of universality class that we are
going to use.  Suppose that an extremal solution to an action with
canonically normalized scalars has a "scaling region" where
 and 
 for many decades of variation of .
Then non-extremal solutions with the horizon well within the scaling
region should again be well-approximated by the original extremal
solution patched onto a Chamblin-Reall solution near the horizon.  The
approximation should become good in the limit where the scaling region
in the extremal solution extends far above and below the value of 
where the horizon is located in the non-extremal solution.  The same
power law, , should pertain.

With the idea of universality classes in hand, we can address
stability of the horizon in a simple way.  In section , we
will study explicitly perturbations around Chamblin-Reall solutions,
involving the metric and the "active" scalar .  We will
find perturbations which are normalizable both at the horizon and far
from it.  As the full solution is well approximated by matching the
extremal solution onto a Chamblin-Reall solution, perturbations
should be well approximated by similarly matched solutions-only,
because the perturbations we are considering are normalizable within
the Chamblin-Reall region, they approach zero near the matching
region, and the perturbations of fields in the extremal region are
very small.  It does not seem plausible that there are normalizable
perturbations which are large in the extremal region and small as one
enters the Chamblin-Reall region near the horizon.  To sum up, we
believe the stability properties of the whole solution are determined
by the stability properties of the near-horizon Chamblin-Reall
solution, which also determines the scaling of entropy with
temperature.

It may seem that we are focusing rather narrowly on a rather special
class of perturbations: not only invariant under the 
that we started with in carrying out the Kaluza-Klein reduction, but
also involving only the metric and the active scalar near the horizon.
This amounts to focusing on a type of fluctuations which we might
describe as adiabatic, since the fields are varying locally in the
same proportions that they would do globally if we simply changed the
temperature.  But this is precisely the mode of instability that the
thermodynamic arguments of suggest.
Instabilities in other modes are conceivable, and one could even study
them by considering scalar fluctuations "transverse" to the
solution.  But we would find it very surprising if such fluctuations
gave rise to normalizable instabilities when the fluctuations we
consider do not.  To put it another way, for that to happen, the logic
of must fail.  Our rather detailed predications about the
nature of the instability amount in a sense to an elaboration of the
connection between thermodynamic and dynamical instabilities.




Static perturbations 

In the rest of this paper, we will investigate Gregory-Laflamme type
instabilities of various black branes.  For all the unstable black
branes Gregory and Laflamme analyzed, they found at
linear order in perturbation theory that there is a static
perturbation, and that instabilities occur at longer wavelengths than
this static perturbation.

As remarked in the introduction, Reall in his approach to
the proof of the conjecture of investigated the
role of such time-independent perturbations, and argued that they are
of central importance to the relation between thermodynamic and
dynamical instability. In particular he related such perturbations of
a black-brane solution to the negative modes of the Lichnerowicz
operator on the Euclidean black hole background found by compactifying
the black -brane on a -torus and doing a Wick rotation. The
existence of such negative modes is then related to thermodynamic
stability. (Negative modes of Euclidean black holes have also been
analyzed in the context of finite temperature stability of
flat spacetime by Gross, Perry and Yaffe.)

Thus when looking for instabilities of black branes, instead of
considering instabilities with arbitrary growth rates, we will
restrict our attention to static threshold perturbations.  With the
relation between thermodynamic and dynamical stabilities in mind, we
expect the dispersion curve of a Gregory-Laflamme type instability to
end at such a threshold point at the small wavelength limit.




The Chamblin-Reall solutions 

As argued in section , close to the horizon, black
brane solutions for gravity coupled to a scalar  with
a potential of the form  provide good
approximations to a broad range of supergravity solutions, including
ones that are non-extremal versions of those that represent RG-flows
in AdS/CFT.

The action for the gravity plus scalar system is
  GravScl 
    S &= d^D x g  (R  - 12 ()^2 -
        V() )     V() &= V_0 e^2  .
   
We will restrict our attention to negative , since that is the
case that admits black hole solutions. The black brane solutions are given 
by
  crAnsatz 
    ds_0^2 = a_0^2(r)(-h_0(r) dt^2 + dx _D-2 ^2) + dr^2h_0(r)  ,
   
where
  crSoln 
    h_0(r) &= 1 - 
     ( r_0r  )^D - 12 ^2 (D - 2)  - 1      a_0(r) &= r^12 ^2(D - 2)      _0(r) &=  -1  (^2 c r) ,
   
and  is given by the positive root of the equation
  cgammaV 
    V_0 = c^2 ( 12  ^2 - 14  D-1D-2  ) .
   
In the notation of (differing slightly from ours), these
solutions correspond to the "type II" case, with , ,
and .  Note that in the gauge presented above, the metric is
independent of : it only depends on , whereas the scalar
profile depends on both  and .

With respect to the general discussion of non-extremal horizons in
section , the solution  is rather special,
in that the functions  and  are entirely independent of
the parameter  that determines the location of the horizon.  (The
equivalent parameter in section  is ).  In
other words, one can get at the solution  by first obtaining
the extremal solution and then using  without changing .
In general,  "back-reacts" on the solution, changing
 and . This property of  also hints at
the origin of the relation : One plugs  in 
 to obtain , just as one would do when looking for 
extremal solutions.

As noted in,
for a discrete set of 's it is possible to
arrive at the solutions ,  by a dimensional reduction of 
spacetimes of the form
 on the -sphere of
. For such cases,  and  are given in
terms of  as
  V0gamma 
    V_0 &= -q(q-1)     &= D+q-2 2q(D-2)  .
   
At least for this discrete set of solutions, we certainly expect to
find dynamical instabilities: they correspond to the instabilities of
an uncharged black string in  spacetime dimensions.  The
's that can be obtained by a dimensional reduction on a
-sphere, where  runs from  to , fall in the range
  gammaRange 
    1 2(D-2)  < < D-1 2(D-2)  .
   
(The case , which gives the upper limit on , is
degenerate:  for that case.) It turns out that 
is precisely the range for which the -dimensional black brane has a
negative specific heat. The conjecture of then
implies that one should have dynamical instabilities for the 's
precisely in this range, including the ones that can't  be
obtained by dimensional reduction.  In the next section, we will give
numerical evidence in favor of this for the case .  (The same
conclusion for other  then follows from straightforward
Kaluza-Klein reduction).


Numerical study of the stability of Chamblin-Reall
solutions 

Choosing , we searched numerically for threshold dynamical
instabilities of the Chamblin-Reall solutions by restricting attention
to perturbations of the form
  PertCR 
    ds^2 &= -e^2A(r,x)  (a_0^2(r) h_0(r) dt^2) + e^2B(r,x) 
      (a_0^2(r) dx^2 + dr^2 h_0(r) )     (r) &= _0(r) + kx  _1(r) ,
   
where
  CRab 
    A(r,x) &= kx  A_1(r)     B(r,x) &= kx  B_1(r) ,
   
and working to linear order in . It is possible to show that this
ansatz for the perturbations is consistent with the equations of motion.


The Einstein equations in  read
  EE 
    R^_= T^_- g^_T^_.
   
Four of these equations are nontrivial, namely the ones involving
, ,  and .  Using the  equation,
one can solve algebraically for  in terms of , , and
.  The  equation and the scalar equation of motion
involve , but not its derivatives. Plugging in  as found
from the  equation into the  equation and the scalar
equation of motion, we end up with the following two equations
involving  and :

(It is possible to do a consistency check by arriving at the same
equations using the  and  equations).

We used the linearity of the equations to fix the value of  at
the horizon.  Then, using a a shooting algorithm, we looked for values
of  and  that would give solutions that are well-behaved
at the horizon and infinity, for a given .  The results for
 as a function of  are shown in figure . As can
be seen from the figure, the wavelengths of the threshold
instabilities diverge as one approaches the thermodynamic stability
limit given by  (the lower
limit in ).  , which corresponds to the upper

Chamblin-Reall solutions changes: in the notation of Chamblin and
Reall, going from  to  corresponds to
going from the  case to the  case of the type II
solutions.

For , we found no static perturbation.  This
plus the thermodynamic stability of the solutions strongly suggests
that they are stable.

In order to address the question of what happens near the threshold of
instability, we attempted to fit the behavior of  as a function of
 to a power law near .  The fit was
considerably better if the threshold of stability was shifted to

.  The fit to a power law was still less
than spectacular.  We suspect that numerical error contributed both to

Crossing the threshold of stability: non-dilatonic
 branes 

Next, we would like to investigate the dynamical stability of D3, M2
and M5-branes. Following the philosophy introduced in the beginning of
section , we will do a Kaluza-Klein reduction of the
metrics  and  on all but one of the spatial
worldvolume directions and , to end up with a 3 dimensional
background.  We will be working with -wave perturbations of this
background, keeping only the two scalars that describe the sizes of
 and the torus, ignoring all the higher harmonics. There will
be two contributions to the potential of these scalars: one due to the
curvature of the  that we compactify on, another due to the
kinetic term of the 4-form (3-form) potential in IIB
(eleven-dimensional) supergravity. Both of these terms will turn out
to be exponentials of a linear combination of the two scalars, hence
the notion of universality classes introduced in
section  will be relevant in this context.

Kaluza-Klein reduction 

We want to perform the dimensional reduction in a way that would give
an Einstein-Hilbert action for gravity, without a scalar-dependent
coefficient in front of the three-dimensional Ricci scalar. For this
purpose, let's start with a general metric
 GenMet 
   ds_D^2 = ds _r^2 + e^2K  ds_p^2 + e^2L ds_q^2
  
where ,  is a metric on the Lorentzian -manifold
,  and  are metrics on compact Riemannian manifolds
 and , respectively, and  and  are functions that depend
only on the coordinates of . For example, for the case of the D3-brane,
,  (two worldvolume directions are compactified), ,
, . Defining
 RescMet 
   ds _r^2 = e^2N  ds_r^2 ,
  
with
 DefN 
   N = - pK +qL r - 2  ,
  
one gets
 GenDimRed 
   -g_D &R(ds_D^2) = -g_r g_p g_q 
     [R(ds_r^2) + e^2(N-K)  R(ds_p^2) + e^2(N-L)  R(ds_q^2) -         &1 r-2 (
          p(r+p-2) _K _K g_r^  +
          q(r+q-2) _L _L g_r^  +
          2pq      _K _L g_r^ 
          )
     ] ,
  
where  denotes the Ricci scalar for the metric . The first term
gives the Einstein-Hilbert lagrangian for  (without a scalar-dependent
factor-as we wanted), and the rest are the kinetic and potential terms for the
scalars  and . In our applications,  and 
will be the 
Ricci scalars of  and , respectively, i.e. 0 and .

Using these results, we get the dimensionally reduced
form of the D3-brane metric and the scalars as
  RedDThreeSol 
    ds_0^2 &= - r^10 f h dt^2 + r^10  f^2 h  dr^2 + r^10  f dx^2     K_0(r) &= -1 4  f      L_0(r) &= r  + 14  f 
   
where  and  are given by  with . The three-dimensional
action is given by
  RedDThreeAct 
    S = d^3x g_3  (R - 12  _^i
      _^j G_ij  g_3^  - V( ) )
   
where
  DThreeKinMat 
    G_ij  =
      (   )        =
      (   )
   
  DThreePot 
    V( ) = -20 e^-4K-12L  + 8R _D3 ^8 e^-4K-20L  ,
   
and  is the length scale defined in , with
.  The first term in  comes from , and the second
one comes from the dimensional reduction of the  term in the
IIB SUGRA action.  We have omitted overall factors from ,
and we have introduced notation that somewhat obscures dimensional
checks: for instance,  has the dimensions of length.  In
practice, we will simply choose an arbitrary numerical value for
 for the numerics in section .
Another way to think of this is that we choose an arbitrary value for
the Planck length, which is permissible because our analysis is
entirely classical.

Since the second term in the potential is due to the charge of the
D3-brane, we expect this term to be of little significance in the
large non-extremality limit.  By performing a linear transformation of
the scalars  and  to canonically normalized ones (i.e. those
with  in equation ) one of which is aligned
with the exponent in the first term of the potential, one finds that
this term corresponds to a Chamblin-Reall coefficient
. That this value is in the unstable range
 is consistent with expectations, since the brane is
expected to be unstable when the effects of the charge are negligible.

Another consistency check can be done by calculating the relevant
exponent  in the Chamblin-Reall equation of state by using
. The equation of state of an uncharged brane can be read
off from  and  to be . The
exponent obtained from  by setting 
agrees precisely with this: one gets  in
both cases.

When the brane is near-extremal, 
, so for radii close to the horizon, . Using this in
, we see that  is approximately constant near the
horizon, i.e. for a near-extremal D3-brane the "active" scalar close
to the horizon is . Thus, in order to read off the relevant
Chamblin-Reall exponent  in the near-extremal regime, one sets
 in the action, and rescales  to make it canonically
normalized: . Then, both terms in the potential
become a multiple of  which shows
that .(The sign of  is
arbitrary since the field redefinition  is equivalent to
switching the sign of  in ,  and
.)   This value of  is in the thermodynamically stable
range, as expected for a near extremal D3-brane. Equation 
gives the equation of state of the near-extremal D3-brane to be
, which is the equation of state of a 3+1-dimensional
CFT, in line with the AdS/CFT correspondence.

The expected transition from the stability for near-extremal branes to
instability at large non-extremalities is also confirmed by the
numerical analysis of dynamical instabilities, which we present in the
next section.

The analysis for black M2 and M5-branes is similar. M2-brane versions of   
, , and  are 
  MTwoEqns 
    ds_0^2 &= - r^14 f h dt^2 + r^14  f^2 h  dr^2 + r^14  f dx^2     K_0(r) &= -1 3  f      L_0(r) &= r  + 16  f     G_ij  &= 
      (   )     V( ) &= -42 e^-2K-16L  + 18 
     R _M2 ^12  e^-2K-28L  ,    
and M5-brane versions are
  MFiveEqns 
    ds_0^2 &= - r^8 f h dt^2 + r^8  f^2 h  dr^2 + r^8  f dx^2     K_0(r) &= -1 6  f      L_0(r) &= r  + 13  f     G_ij  &=
      (   )     V( ) &= -12 e^-8K-10L  + 92  
     R _M5 ^6 e^-8K-16L  ,
   
where  and  are given by  and  and
 are given by  with  for the M2-brane
and  for the M2-brane. Once again for large non-extremality the
potential terms due to the charges can be neglected, and by using
canonically normalized scalars one can calculate the 's that
are relevant for the terms due to the curvatures of . One
gets  for the M2-brane and
 for the M5-brane. As in the D3-brane
case, these are consistent with the equations of state of uncharged
branes:  for the M2-brane and  for
the M5-brane. In the near-extremal limits, the "active" scalar is
 for the M2 and M5-branes as well, and one gets the corresponding
Chamblin-Reall coefficients as  for the M2-brane
and  for the M5-brane. The equations of state one
gets from these are consistent with expectations from AdS/CFT:
 for the M2-brane and  for the M5-brane.




Numerical stability analysis for non-dilatonic branes 

We will describe the stability analysis for the D3-brane in some
detail, and just show results for the M2-brane and the M5-brane.

In order to investigate the dynamical stability of the
three-dimensional background , obtained by Kaluza-Klein
reduction from the D3-brane, we introduce the perturbations
  DThreePert 
    ds^2 &= - e^2A(r,x)  ( r^10  f h dt^2 ) + e^2B(r,x)  (
      r^10 f^2 h  dr^2 + r^10  f dx^2 )     A(r,x) &= kx  A_1(r)     B(r,x) &= kx  B_1(r)     K(r,x) &= K_0(r) + kx  K_1(r)     L(r,x) &= L_0(r) + kx  L_1(r) ,
   
and work to linear order in .   and  are the scalars
introduced in .

There are four nontrivial Einstein equations (those involving ,
,  and ), and two scalar equations of
motion. Using the  equation, one can solve for 
.  The  equation and both of the scalar
equations of motion involve , but not its derivatives.  Plugging
in  as found from the  equation into the  equation
and the scalar equations of motion, we end up with three equations
involving ,  and  (it is possible to do a consistency
check by arriving at the same equations using the  and 
equations). Defining , the equations read

  Instabilities of black D3, M2, and M5-branes. 
     The dots represent threshold instabilities of the black branes 
     we found. The vertical lines indicate the thermodynamic 
     stability limits, which were found by , with 
      for the D3-brane,  for the
     M2-brane, and  for the M5-brane.  
     The curves indicate 
     wavenumbers of threshold instabilities of uncharged  black branes,
     with  being the Schwarzchild radius.
       
Solving these linear ODE's numerically, one extracts using a shooting
algorithm the value of  where a static perturbation exists, for any
specified non-extremal mass.  The results of this numerical
investigation are summarized in figure . For large
non-extremality, the threshold wavenumbers fit nicely onto the curve
that gives those of an uncharged 3-brane. (This curve was obtained by
reading off the wavenumber of the threshold instability of an
uncharged 3-brane from the plots in, and doing an
appropriate scaling to get the values for an arbitrary .) As one
approaches the thermodynamic stability limit, the wavenumbers approach
to zero. In fact, by zooming into this region, we were able to show
that the wavenumbers go to zero approximately with a power-law
behavior, with the critical exponent being close to : that is, 
 where  is the critical value where the
instability disappears.  Because  is a non-singular function of
, one could also write .
A naive way of understanding this is to think
of some effective theory describing the perturbations in terms of a
bosonic field with .  Then the criterion for the
perturbations to be static is , where  is
the wave-number of a static perturbation.  The resulting equation, 
, predicts the observed scaling, provided 
.  Such analytic behavior is a standard assumption: our
argument basically amounts to a naive application of Landau
theory.(It is actually a little too naive, because it
predicts an incorrect dispersion relation.  In, it
was found that  as , whereas using 
 would suggest finite  at .  Possibly an
improved understanding could be based on hydrodynamic considerations.) 



The numerical stability analyses for the M2-brane and M5-brane are
similar to the one for the D3-brane.  The results are summarized in
figure . Once again, near the thermodynamic stability
limit, the wavenumbers go approximately as .



Conclusions 

The stability of charged -brane solutions was first attacked in
.  Although the methods presented there are in principle
practicable for any solution, they require considerable computational
fortitude to apply.  We have argued that a simple notion of
universality classes is fairly broadly applicable to the question of
brane stability: one commonly finds a thermodynamic relation 
 for charged -brane solutions in some limiting
regime of parameters, and when one does, the stability properties
depend only on -stability pertaining when .  Given
our treatment of the problem via a Kaluza-Klein reduction / truncation
to a 2+1-dimensional action involving scalars and gravity, the
dispersion relation of unstable modes would also appear to be the same
for any solution in the universality class labeled by a given
.

We have further shown, in section , that when one
approaches a boundary of stability, the critical wavelength separating
stable from unstable modes diverges, and that it does so for the cases
studied with a critical exponent that could be guessed on the grounds
of a naive effective field theory argument.  It would be interesting
to see if other exponents arise from non-generic situations, for
instance a case where the temperature  depends on mass as 
 for some .  It is possible
that spinning brane solutions provide a venue for more intricate
thermodynamics, but one would encounter there the
complication of chemical potentials for the various angular momenta.

For the -branes of type II string theory and M-theory, away from
extremality but without angular momenta, thermodynamic stability
pertains up to an upper mass limit given in equation .  For the
D3-brane, the M2-brane, and the M5-brane, our numerical analysis
supports the claim that dynamical and
thermodynamic stability coincide.  Extending the analysis to other
-branes should not be too difficult.  

In conclusion, it seems that the notion of universality classes that
we introduced in section , together with the
behavior at a boundary of stability explored in section ,
represent a fairly comprehensive description of the qualitative
features of the Gregory-Laflamme instability in linearized
perturbation theory.  Of course, it would be desirable to go beyond
classical perturbation theory in understanding universality classes of
behaviors for non-uniform horizons.  Some of the methods of this paper
may prove useful in that broader context as well.
