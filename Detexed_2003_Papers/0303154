We present a class of scalar field cosmologies with a dynamically 
evolving Newton parameter  and cosmological term .
In particular, we discuss a class of solutions which are consistent 
with a renormalization group scaling
for  and   near a fixed point.
Moreover, we propose a modified action for gravity which includes the 
effective running of  and  near the fixed point.

introduction 
The recent discovery that Einstein gravity is most probably renormalizable
at a non-perturbative levelhas triggered many investigations on the 
possible consequences of these findings
in cosmology. In, a cosmology of the Planck Era, 
valid immediately after the initial singularity, 
was discussed. In this model the Newton constant  
and the cosmological constant  are dynamically  
coupled to the geometry by "improving" 
the Einstein equations with the renormalization group (hereafter RG) 
equations for Quantum Einstein Gravity.
This modified Einstein theory is not affected by the 
horizon and flatness problems of the cosmological standard model. 

In, a similar framework has been extended 
to the study of the large scale dynamics of the Universe. 
In this case a solution of the "cosmic coincidence problem" 
 arises naturally without 
the introduction of a quintessence  field, because
the vacuum energy density 
is automatically adjusted so as to equal the matter energy density, 
i.e.  . 
We shall term the models discussed in as fixed point  
(hereafter FP) cosmologies, or equivalently, 
RG-invariant cosmologies. 

In a nutshell, the renormalization group improvement   
consists in the modified Einstein equations
ein 
R_ -1 2 g_ R = -g_ (k)+
8G(k) T_ 
where the Newton parameter  and cosmological term  
are now dependent on the scale ,  being 
the running cut-off of the renormalization group equation.
This framework has been also applied in General Relativity in,
in the dynamical context of a gravitational collapse,
and in for a Schwarzschild black hole. 
 
In cosmology, the dynamical evolution is instead determined by a set of 
renormalization group equations by means of the cut-off identification  which 
relates the energy scale of the running 
cutoff  of the renormalization group, with the cosmic time . 
In it has been shown that, in a cosmological setting, the correct
cutoff identification is ;
it is thus possible to determine  and  in
Eq.() once a RG trajectory is available. 
The aim of this paper is to extend the results discussed into the case of a scalar field coupled to gravity.

Let us in fact assume that, besides the non-Gaussian fixed point discovered
in for pure gravity, the standard Gaussian fixed point is accessible in
perturbation theory in the scalar sector (this is actually the case
for a free scalar field, and it also emerges from the analysis 
of for a self interacting scalar theory). 
Then, a solution which is compatible with a possible RG trajectory for the scalar
sector must predict a simple renormalizable potential for spin-0 
particles. We thus show that there exists a class of solutions 
for the well-known renormalizable  potential. 

In addition, we also discuss a possible renormalization group improvement
at the level of the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian itself. In this
case, solutions for a class of power law self-interaction potentials are available only
for some specific values of the quartic self-interaction coupling
constants.

The plan of this work is the following: in Sec.II we introduce 
the basic equations and present the scalar
field solution. In Sec.III we discuss the RG improvement
in the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian. Sec.IV is devoted to the conclusions.

the model 
We now introduce the basic equations of the FP cosmologies for a scalar 
field matter component. 




Let us recall that the effective energy density and pressure of a generic 
scalar field read:
eq:dens 
&&_= 12  ^2+V(), 

&& p_= 12  ^2-V(),
respectively. In term of  and 
 the coupled system of RG improved evolution equations 
read
 
&&(a  a )^2+K a^2 =1 3 +
8 3 G_, 

&& +3a  a +V'()=0, 

&& +8 G _

&&G(t) G(k(t)),  (t) (k(t)), Eq.() is the improved Friedman equation, 
Eq.() is the Klein-Gordon equation,
Eq.() follows from the Bianchi identities, 
and Eqs.() are determined from the 
renormalization group equations once the cutoff 
identification  is given.







We define the vacuum energy density , the total energy density
 and the critical energy density  according to
&&_ (t) (t) 8 G(t) , 

&&_tot  (t) _+ , 

&&_crit  (t) 3  8 G(t)  (a  a 
)^2  ,
with .
Hence we may rewrite the improved Friedman equation () in the form
a^2+K a^2  = 8  3  G(t) .
We refer the various energy densities to the critical density
():
&&_   _crit  , 
_  
_  _crit   , 

&&_tot = _  + 
_  _tot  _crit   .
It follows from these definitions that
the Friedman equation () becomes
K=a^2  [_tot -1].
For a spatially flat universe () we need , as in
standard cosmology. In the following we shall discuss only the  case. 
In order to solve the system () 
we consider the first three equations
in () without the RG equations (). 
While in general () can be solved once  is given, 
we shall see  that the perfect fluid  
ansatz ,  being a constant, 
is equivalent to assume a class of 
power-law potential .

We first consider the first three equations
in () without the RG equations (), and then we determine
the solutions consistent with a given RG trajectory.
The potential can be written as
eq:pot 
V() = 1 2  ^2 ( 1-w 1+w  ),
which shows that the value  should be ruled out, as
we will do from now on. By
substitution in the Klein-Gordon equation () we readily obtain
eq:eu 
_= 1 1+w  ^2 
M 8a^3(1+w)  ,
where  is an integration constant. 
By substituting into Eq.() we derive the following power-law 
solutions:
 
23a 
&&a(t) = [3(1+w)^2 2(n+2) M  C]^1/(3+3w) 
t^(n+2)/(3+3w) , 

&&(t) = (4(n+2) 12(1+w)Cn^2 )^1/2  
t^-n/2 , 
 
&&G(t) = C t^n  , 

&&(t) = n(n+2) 3(1+w)^2 1 t^2 , where  is a constant 
and  is a positive integer. 
For example, writing 
 and expressing  as
in (), Eq.() yields, for , a first-order algebraic
equation for , which is solved by .
Eq.() is then integrated to get the result ().
As anticipated, the potential is also a power law, i.e.
potential 
V() = 1-w 2+2w 
( 12(w+1)C n+2  )^2 n   
(n 2 )^2(n+2) n   
^2(n+2) n  .
The RG equations () have not been used so far. What is the correct 
RG trajectory for a self-interacting scalar field coupled with gravity? 
Let us consider the RG-trajectory discussed in the introduction, where
in the deep UV region we must have the non-Gaussian fixed point 
 in the gravitational
sector, and  the Gaussian one in the scalar field sector.
In this case, the renormalized trajectory for the dimensionful quantities
reads:
rg 
G(k) =  /k^2 ,  (k) = k^2 , 
where ,  are the dimensionless couplings  and ,
respectively, at the ultraviolet non-Gaussian fixed point .
The numerical values have been obtained in the analysis ofand read  ,  approximately. 

The next step is to determine  as a function of . 
In it was shown that the 
correct cutoff identification is given by 
cuti 
k(t) =  /t  .
Therefore, we see from () that we are led to set
 in () and  in (). At last,
the following renormalization group invariant  
(or fixed-point) solution is obtained:
 
24a 
&&a(t) = [(3 8 )^2 (1+w)^4 M  
]^1/(3+3w) t^4/(3+3w) , 

&&(t) = (8 9(1+w)^3 )^1/2  
 1 t , 
 
&&G(t) = 3 8 (1+w)^2t^2 , 

&&(t) = 8 3(1+w)^2 1 t^2 . The solution, as far as ,  and  are concerned, is 
basically the same as what already discussed in but in this case the
potential reads
pot2 
V() = 9  16 (1-w)(1+w)^2 ^4 ,
which is the standard renormalizable quartic self-interacting potential for 
a massless scalar theory. The role of  is now clear: it allows a 
convenient parametrization of the solution in terms of the parameter  
instead of the self-interaction coupling constant in the potential.
It in fact measures the self-coupling strength :
for  (stiff matter  equation of state)  and 
 is a free field, while for ,  is an interacting field.  
For  the theory is not bounded from below. 

Other properties of the solution () have extensively been discussed
in and we shall not repeat that discussion here.
We simply observe that for the solution (), 
we have  at any time.


improving the action 
One of the striking properties of the renormalization group 
trajectory () is that the following 
relation holds:
rela 
=  G  .
This fact has a deep meaning and is related to the possibility of reducing 
the number of coupling constants in a RG-invariant theory.
What happens in our case is that near the
fixed point it is always possible to consider 
 and the effective
scaling is ruled only by , for instance.
This fact suggests that a more fundamental approach 
should consider  as a function of  from the beginning, 
perhaps at the level of the action itself.

Let us then consider the action
action 
S = d^4x-g (R G -2(G) G )+S_m ,
where  is the action for the matter field.
In this case, variation with respect to  
leads to Eqs.()
and variation with respect to  gives an additional constraint equation 
(see also):
con 
-R G +2 G -2d d G  =0.
This equation, jointly with Eq.() and the field equations yields
con2 
2= 8G (_+3p_) = 8G_(1+3 w).
By inserting the general solution () in () we have
con3 
n = (1+3w).
In particular, for the case of interest , and hence , leading
in turn to the renormalizable interaction
pot3 
V() =2  3 ^4 . 
The relevant property of this solution is that the effective 
strength of the interaction self-coupling is determined entirely by
the fixed point values  and . 
For a free scalar field  and this value does not
change in a significant way in the interacting case.
Loop corrections are then expected to be small and the leading tree
level form of the potential () holds.
We can thus regard the cosmology () with 
as an exact solution of the modified Einstein-Lagrangian () which 
is consistent with a RG flow near the non-Gaussian fixed point in the gravitational sector
and the Gaussian one in the matter sector.
conclusion 
We have presented a class of power-law cosmologies 
with variable  and  in the case
of a scalar field matter component, Eq.(). 
We have then extended the FP cosmology 
presented in by including the 
RG evolution Eq.() in the general solution (). 
Last, we have presented a new RG-improvement at the level of the action
which picks out a specific self-interaction strength 
value for the scalar field potential.   
The scalar solution () with  can, at best, be considered 
only a toy model of the initial state of the Universe. 
However, it may be helpful in understanding a more 
complete framework where the dynamical evolution of the gravitational field 
and the matter field near the initial singularity 
is consistent with RG scaling law of the renormalized 
theory near a fixed point.
