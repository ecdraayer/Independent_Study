 Abstract 




We have covariantized the Lagrangians of the   models, 
which have   gauge symmetry in two dimensions, 
and studied their symmetric structures. 
The special property of the   models is the fact that 
all these models have an extra time coordinate 
in the target space-time. 
The   models coupled to two-dimensional gravity
are string models 
in  dimensional target space-time 
for bosonic string and 
in  dimensional target space-time 
for superstring. 
Both string models have two time coordinates. 
In order to construct 
the covariant Lagrangians of the   models 
the generalized Chern-Simons term plays an important role. 
The supersymmetric generalized Chern-Simons action is 
also proposed. 
The Green-Schwarz type of   superstring model has 
another fermionic local symmetry as well as -symmetry.
The supersymmetry of target space-time is different from 
the standard one.





Introduction 
The motivation of this paper is to understand the reason why 
there is only one time coordinate in real world.
If there are more than two time coordinates, what happens?  
To consider more than two time coordinates might be 
a clue to understand the origin of time.
In order to understand this problem 
we in this paper study 
the symmetric structure of several   models 
each of which has an extra time coordinate.

There are several models 
which has more than two time coordinates. 
For example, 
F-theory, 
two-time physics, 
and so on. 
F-theory is constructed as a field theory of (2,2)-brane 
in  dimensional space-time, 
i.e. 10 space coordinates and 2 time coordinates. 
The two-time physics proposed by I. Bars et. al. is 
constructed by using the field theory of multi particles. 
Several years ago, the author also proposed string models 
which have two time coordinates in ref. .
These models have   gauge symmetry in two dimensions. 
The target space-time of   bosonic string is 
 dimensions, 
while 
that of   superstring is  dimensions. 
The manifest covariant expression of these models 
was not found in those days. 
In this paper we will give the covariant Lagrangians 
and will study the local gauge symmetries. 

The   models are field theories 
defined in two-dimensional space-time.
In section 2 we study the   bosonic models 
without and with two-dimensional gravity.
In subsection 2.1 
we introduce the   bosonic model 
without gravityand extend this model to the model which has manifestly 
ISO(,1) Poincare symmetry. 
In order to obtain the ISO(,1) symmetry, 
i.e. 
in order to obtain the covariant expression,
the generalized Chern-Simons term plays an important role. 
In subsection 2.2 
the property of the generalized Chern-Simons term 
introduced in the previous subsection is discussed. 
In subsection 2.3 we couple the   model 
to two-dimensional gravity, i.e. 
we obtain a kind of string theory 
which has   symmetry in two dimensions and 
ISO(26,2) Poincare symmetry at the target space-time. 
Though this model is already proposed 
in ref. , 
the covariant expression given in this paper is new. 
In section 3 we study the supersymmetric version of 
the   models without and with two-dimensional supergravity. 
We covariantize the Lagrangian of 
the Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond type of   superstring model 
proposed in ref. .
This superstring model has 
ISO(10,2) Poincare symmetry in the target space-time. 
The supersymmetric version of 
the generalized Chern-Simons Lagrangian, 
which is necessary for the covariantization of   models, 
is proposed here. 
Section 4 is devoted to the Green-Schwarz type 
of   superstring model. 
We will show that this model has 
another fermionic local symmetry besides -symmetry. 
Section 5 is the discussions and the conclusions. 



  Bosonic Theories 

  bosonic model without gravity 

In this subsection we study the   model 
which is described in two dimensions 
and has no gravitational field. 
The space-time coordinates are  (, ) and 
the signature of metric  is . 
The fields of the   model 
consists of an Abelian gauge field  
and several matter fields. 
The theory has 
both a vector U(1) local symmetry " 
and an axial vector U(1) local symmetry 
" 
in two dimensions, 
i.e. the theory is invariant 
under the local gauge transformation, 
. 

In refs.  the   model is proposed. 
The Lagrangian is 
LagrangianLCfermionic 
 =   
- i  _a _a ^m _m _a 
-  _a e_a A_m  j^a m  
+ _a,b  g_a b   j^a m  j_m^b
 ,
and the current is 
CurrentLCfermionic 
j^a m    =   _a ^m _a
 ,
where the indices  and  run 
, , ,  (). 
 are spinor fermionic matter fields. 
The charges  and the coupling constants  
satisfy the following two conditions,
&&
a)      
_a,b  G^ab   e_a e_b   =   0  ,


&&
b)      
one of the eigenvalues of  is negative, 
      others are positive 
where
BackgroundMetric 
G_ab    =   _ab  + 2 g_ab   , 
        
G^ab    =   (G_ab )^-1   .
Both coupling constants  and  are 
real symmetric matrices. 
The Lagrangian LagrangianLCfermionic  is invariant 
under the following local  transformations, 
A_m     &=&  _m v + _m ^n _n  ,


_a  &=&  i e_a (v -   ) _a  .
The parameters  and  describe 
 and  
gauge transformations, respectively. 
In the model defined by 
the Lagrangian LagrangianLCfermionic , 
 gauge symmetry is manifest, 
on the other hand,  gauge symmetry 
is non-trivial because 
the axial-vector anomaly is cancelled non-perturbatively. 
The non-perturbative cancellation of the axial-vector anomaly 
requires the condition LightlikeCondition . 
This condition leads us to the fact that 
the matrix  is not positive definite 
nor negative definite. 
On the other hand, 
the unitarity, i.e. the absence of negative norm states, 
requires the condition that 
the number of negative eigenvalues of  
is equal to zero or one.
Together with condition LightlikeCondition , 
the condition NoGhostCondition  is obtained. 

The bosonization leads us to the Lagrangian 
LagrangianLCbosonic 
 =   
-  _a,b  G_ab  ^m ^a _m ^b 
-  _a e_a A_m  j^a m  
 ,
and the current
CurrentLCbosonic 
j^a m    =   1     ^mn  _n ^a
 ,
where  are scalar bosonic matter fields. 
The Lagrangian LagrangianLCbosonic  is invariant 
under the local transformations U1U1transfA  and 
U1U1transfxi 
^a   =   
1    _b G^ab  e_b   .
Both  and  symmetries 
are manifest in the bosonized expression. 

In the Lagrangian LagrangianLCbosonic , 
 can be considered to be a background metric. 
So, it is decomposed by using 
the -dimensional vielbein  
which satisfies 
BackgroundMetricVielbein 
G_ab    =   
_I,J  _IJ   _a^I  _b^J    ,

        
_a,b  G^ab  _a^I  _b^J  = ^IJ   ,
where  is a symmetric matrix defined by 
FlatmetricDefinition 
_IJ    =   ^IJ    =  
     .
 .
The index  runs , , , , 
while 
the index  runs , , , , 
and , . 


In our notation, the indices  and  
will always run over the above all values. 
The negative metric  
comes from the property NoGhostCondition .
The light-cone-like indices  and  
are introduced by 
plusminussign 
X^     =   
1 2   ( X^0   X^1   )
 .
Then, one has, for example, 

 
and 

. 
Without loss of generality, one can choose  as 
e_zeta 
_a^-    =  e_a   ,


owing to the condition LightlikeCondition .
Then, the Lagrangian LagrangianLCbosonic  is rewritten as 
LagrangianLC 
 =   
-   ^m ^I _m _I 
+ 1    ^m _m ^-   
 ,
where 
 
^I   =   _a _a^I  ^a
and . 
The indices  and  are lowered and raised 
by the background metric  and , respectively. 

Using the light-cone-like indices, 
the local transformation U1U1transfxi  becomes 
U1U1transfxiLC 
^+     =   -  1     
 ,         
^I   =   0     () 
 .
This transformation makes us possible to take 
the light-cone-like gauge fixing condition, 
LightConeBosonic 
^+     =   0  .
The path-integration of  gives 
LightconeBosonic 
_m ^-   = 0
 . 
The gauge field  plays a role of a Lagrange multiplier. 








The first term of the Lagrangian LagrangianLC  has 
Poincare ISO(,1) global symmetry. 
So it is quite natural that one expects 
the existence of the Lagrangian 
which has ISO(,1) global symmetry. 
Introducing the auxiliary field  
and new gauge fields 
 and 
,
we have succeeded in extending the Lagrangian LagrangianLC  
to the Lagrangian which has ISO(,1) global symmetry, 
LagrangianBosonic 
 =  
-  ^m ^I _m _I 

+ ^m _I _m ^I
+ ^mI  _m _I
- ^I _I   .
The Lagrangian LagrangianBosonic  is invariant 
under the following local gauge transformations:
^I &=&   ^I
 , 

_m &=&   _m + _m ^n _n v
 , 

^I &=& 0
 , 



_m^I &=& 
                   _m ^n _n u^I + _m ^I 
                   - v _m ^n _n ^I - _m ^I
 , 

&=&     _m ^m + _m ^m - _m ^m
 , where  and  
are new local gauge parameters. 
It should be noted that 
the gauge transformation LocalGaugeTransfBosonic  
has on-shell reducibility, 
i.e. 
the transformation LocalGaugeTransfBosonic  
has on-shell invariance under the following local gauge transformation, 
v    &=& 0
 , 

&=& 0
 , 

u^I   &=& w' ^I
 , 



_m &=& _m ^n _n w' 
 . The Lagrangian LagrangianBosonic  is also invariant 
under the global transformations of ISO(,1) and scale symmetries 
as follows: 
^I  &=&  ^I _J ^J  +  a^I
 , 

_m  &=&  r _m + _i=1 ^2g  _i h^(i) _m
 , 

^I &=& -  r ^I + ^I _J ^J
 , 



_m^I &=& 
  r _m^I + ^I _J _m^J  
  + _i=1 ^2g  ( _i^I + _i ^I) h^(i) _m
 , 

&=& 2r 
 , where , 
, ,  and  are global parameters, 
and  
are harmonic functions which satisfy 
 
(;  genus of 2D space-time). 
The Lagrangian LagrangianBosonic  is also invariant 
under the following two discrete transformations:
&&i)     
           , 
           ,
           ,
           otherwise unchanged,     


&&ii)     
           , 
           ,
           
           ,
           otherwise unchanged.  
Both discrete transformations are 
a kind of parity transformations of background space-time.

The equations of motion of the Lagrangian LagrangianBosonic  
are 
&& ^m _m ^I - _m ( ^m ^I )   =   0  
 , 

&& _I _m ^I   =   0  
 , 

&& ^m _m ^I - _m ^mI  - ^I   =   0  
 , 

&& _m ^I   =   0  
 , 

&& ^I _I   =   0  
 . The solution of 
 and  
in EOMBosonic  is 
auxiliaryfieldSolution 
^I   =  
     .   ,
where we have used the global transformations 
GlobalGaugeTransfBosonic . 
Though  is another solution, 
one needs a concept of fine tuning to realize this solution. 
In the case of the solution auxiliaryfieldSolution , 
the gauge transformation LocalGaugeTransfBosonic  
makes us possible to choose 
the light-cone-like gauge fixing condition LightConeBosonic , 
and then, 
the Lagrangian LagrangianBosonic  becomes LagrangianLC . 
Thus, the equivalence of the Lagrangians 
LagrangianLC  and LagrangianBosonic  has been proved 
at the classical level. 


Generalized Chern-Simons action 

In this subsection we will show that 
a part of the Lagrangian LagrangianBosonic , 
LagrangianGCSoriginal 
_GCS   =   
^mI  _m _I
- ^I _I 
 ,
which is introduced 
for covariantizing the Lagrangian LagrangianLC ,
is the generalized Chern-Simons Lagrangian. 

The generalized Chern-Simons Lagrangian in two dimensions is defined by 
LagrangianGCS 
_GCS   =   
 ( B + B^2 ) + ^2 C 
 ,
where 
GCSrep 
 =   _  ^       ,
      
B        =   x^m T_a  B_m^a        ,
      
C        =   x^m  x^n  
               C_mn ^ ,
and . 
 is a trace defined below. 
The Lagrangian LagrangianGCS  has the gauge invariance 
under the local gauge transformation:
&=&  [ , u ]    ,


B     &=&  u + [ B , u ] -  , w    ,


C     &=&  w +  B , w  + [ C , u ] - [ , q ]   ,
where
GCSrep2 
u    =   T_a  u^a          ,
      
w    =   x^m w_m^ ,
      
q        =   x^m  x^n  
                T'_a' q_mn ^a'        .
Here, , ,  and  satisfy 
a graded Lie algebra, 
&&
 _  ,   =  
f_ ^c  T_c  
 , 

&&
[ _  , T_b  ]  =  
f_b  ^c  _c    ,
      
[ , T_b  ]  =  
f_b  ^
      
[ _  , T'_b'  ]  =  
f_b'  ^
 , 

&&
[ T_a  , T_b  ]  =  
f_a b  ^c  T_c    ,

[ T_a  , T'_b'  ]  =  
f_a b'  ^c'  T'_c'   
 . Note that 
 and  
are not Grassmannian. 
In  one can move any 
, ,  or  
cyclically, 
i.e. 
, 
, 
and so on.

In order to obtain LagrangianGCSoriginal  from LagrangianGCS , 
one chooses the representation, 
&&
_   =  _I ,   _+ [ _I , _J ]   ,
      
T_a         =  _+ _I   ,


&&
=  _+   ,

T'_a'   =  _+   ,
i.e. 
&=& _I ^I + 
          _+ [ _I , _J ] 
          ^IJ 
 , 

B &=& _+ _I B^I_m x^m
 , 

C &=& _+ C_mn  x^m  x^n
 , and
u &=& _+ _I u^I 
 ,


w &=& _+ w_m x^m
 ,


q &=& _+ q_mn  x^m  x^n
 ,
where 
, , 
and . 
 and  are the gamma matrices 
of SO(1,1) and SO(,1) respectively, 
and satisfy 
 
and 
 
respectively. 
 is a  matrix 
while
 is a  matrix. 
The trace  is defined by 
, 
where  is a usual trace which takes 
both -matrix and -matrix into account, 
for example, . 
The concrete expression for -matrices is 
gamma_matrix 
_+  =  
(  
)  ,  _-  =  
(  
)  .
One finds, for example, 
, 
.

Since , , ,  and 
in the case of representation GCSrep3 , 
the Lagrangian LagrangianGCS  becomes a simple form, 
LagrangianGCS3 
_GCS   =   
(  B + ^2 C )
 ,
and the gauge transformation GCStransf  becomes 
&=& [ , u ] 
 ,


B &=& u -  , w 
 ,


C &=& w 
 .
The field  is decoupled 
because it does not appear in the Lagrangian. 
Therefore, one can set  without loss of generality, 
namely, 
 and 
the gauge transformation of  is 
. 
The gauge parameter  is also decoupled. 


  bosonic string 
In this subsection we consider 
the   bosonic model coupled to 2D gravity, i.e. 
the   bosonic string model. 

The   bosonic string model is described 
by the Lagrangian LagrangianBosonic  
under the curved 2D space-time with metric , i.e. 
LagrangianBosonicGravity 
 =   -g   (
- g^mn  _m ^I _n _I 

+ ^m _I _m ^I
+ ^mI  _m _I
- ^I _I  )
 ,
where . 
In this model 
the unitarity allows us two negative eigenvalues of , 
i.e. the condition 
&&
b)      
two of the eigenvalues of  is negative, 
      others are positive 
is required instead of the condition NoGhostCondition  
because the general coordinate transformations 
as well as the  gauge transfomations 
remove one negative norm state, respectively. 
Therefore, 
the index  runs 
, , , , , , , 
where one has to use the background metric  
FlatmetricDefinitionGravity 
_IJ    =   ^IJ    =  
     .
instead of FlatmetricDefinition . 

There are two negative metric components 
 and , 
while there is one negative metric component 
 
in the   bosonic model without gravity. 

This Lagrangian is invariant 
under the local   transformations, 
the general coordinate transformations and the Weyl scaling as follows:
^I &=&   ^I
 , 

_m &=&   _m + _m ^n _n v 
 , 

^I &=& 0
 , 



_m^I &=& 
                   _m ^n _n u^I + _m ^I 
                   - v  _m ^n _n ^I - _m ^I
 , 

&=&     _m ^m + _m ^m - _m ^m
 , 

g_mn  &=&  0
 , and
^I &=&   k^n _n ^I
 , 

_m &=&   k^n _n _m + _m k^n _n
 , 

^I &=& k^n _n ^I
 , 



_m^I &=& k^n _n _m^I + _m k^n _n^I
 , 

&=&     k^n _n + 2 s  , 

g_mn  &=&  k^l _l g_mn  + _m k^l g_ln  + _n k^l g_ml 
                   - 2 s g_mn 
 , where  and  are local parameters for 
the general coordinate transformation and the Weyl transformation. 
 
is the anti-symmetric tensor on 2D curved space-time. 
It should be noted that 
the gauge transformation LocalGaugeTransfBosonicGravity  
has on-shell reducibility, 
as the same as the gauge transformation LocalGaugeTransfBosonic .
The transformation LocalGaugeTransfBosonicGravity  
has on-shell invariance under the local gauge transformation, 

v    &=& 0
 , 

&=& 0
 , 

u^I   &=& w' ^I
 , 



_m &=& _m ^n _n w' 
 , which is the two-dimensional covariant form of 
LocalGaugeTransfBosonic . 

The Lagrangian LagrangianBosonicGravity  is also invariant 
under the global transformations GlobalGaugeTransfBosonic  
and the discrete transformations 
DiscreteTransfBosonic1  and DiscreteTransfBosonic2 , 
where  
are harmonic functions on curved 2D space-time 
which satisfy 
 
(). 
The Poincare symmetry is ISO(,2). 







By introducing new fields 
, , , , , 
and a new parameter , 
&&
A ^m      =   -g   ^m
 ,       
B ^mI    =   -g   ^mI 
 ,       
C         =   -g    , 

&&
g ^mn    =   -g   g^mn 
 ,      
p
 , 
w ^m      =   -g   ^m
the Lagrangian LagrangianBosonicGravity  is rewritten as 
&=&
-  g ^mn  _m ^I _n _I 

+ A ^m _I _m ^I
+ B ^mI  _m _I
- C  ^I _I


&&+  p  ( g ^mn  + 1 )
 ,
and the gauge transformations 
LocalGaugeTransfBosonicGravity  and 
GeneralCoordinateTransfBosonicGravity  are rewritten as 
^I &=&   k^n _n ^I  +  ^I
 , 

A ^m &=&  _n ( k^n A ^m ) - _n k^m A ^n + 
                      g ^mn  _n + ^mn  _n v 
 , 

^I  &=&  k^n _n ^I
 , 



B ^mI  &=& 
                _n ( k^n B ^mI  ) - _n k^m B ^nI 
              + ^mn  _n u^I 


           && +  g ^mn  _n ^I 
              - v  ^mn  _n ^I - w ^m ^I
 , 

C  &=& _n ( k^n C  ) + 
      _m w ^m + _m A ^m - _m A ^m
 , 

g ^mn  &=&  _l ( k^l g ^mn  ) 
      - _l k^m g ^ln  - _l k^n g ^ml 
 , 

p  &=&  _n ( k^n p ) 
 , where  is a Lagrange multiplier field. 
The third and the fourth terms 
in LagrangianBosonicGravityModified  
is the generalized Chern-Simons term 
 LagrangianGCSoriginal . 
Both 
the Lagrangian LagrangianBosonicGravityModified  
and 
the gauge transformations LocalGaugeTransfBosonicGravityModified 
are polynomials of fields and parameters. 

At the quantum level, 
the absence of conformal anomaly requires . 
We will give the reason in the following. 
The conformal charge for a spin  particle is 
. 
The gauge field give a negative sign to the conformal charge 
because the FP ghost field has opposite statistics. 
The   bosonic string model consists of 
one graviton (), one photon (), 
and  scalar particles (). 
Therefore, 
the total conformal charge of   bosonic string model is 
w^(N=0)  
&=&  2  (-13) + 2  (-1) + D  1 


&=&  D - 28 
 , where  comes from the number of components. 
The fields , , and  
do not contribute to the conformal charge 
because these fields come from the generalized Chern-Simons action 
which is considered to be topological. 
The cancellation of conformal anomaly, i.e. 
the existence of the Weyl symmetry at the quantum level 
requires . 
Thus, we obtain  from ConformalWeightBosonic . 
The detail calculation about the quantization 
will be given in the paper. 
The discussion about the spectrum will be also given there. 


  Supersymmetric Theories 

In this section we extend the previous models to 
the models with  supersymmetry. 
We use the (1,1) type superspace with coordinates

  supersymmetric model without gravity 

In the case of supersymmetric version of 
the   model without gravity, 
we introduce superfields

respectively. 
,  and  are 
scalar bosonic superfields, on the other hand, 
 and  are 
spinor fermionic superfields. 
In ref.  
the supersymmetric version of 
LagrangianLCbosonic  is proposed. 
In the previous section we have succeeded in covariantizing 
the Lagrangian of the   bosonic model. 
So, it is now easy to obtain the covariant Lagrangian of 
the   supersymmetric model. 
The covariant Lagrangian for the   supersymmetric model 
without gravity is 
LagrangianSuper

-  ^^I __I

 .
The background metric  is FlatmetricDefinition . 
This Lagrangian is invariant 
under the following local and global transformations:
The local gauge transformations are 
^I &=&   ^I 
 , 

_&=&   _+ (  )_V

_^I &=&  
    (  )_U^I + _^I 
 - V(  )_^I - _^I

&=& ^_+ ^_
                - ^_ , where the parameters  and  describe 
super- and super- 
gauge transformations, respectively. 
The parameters  and  
are related with 
the symmetry of supersymmetric generalized Chern-Simons term
whose property will be discussed in next subsection.
The global transformations are 
^I &=& ^I _J ^J  +  a^I

    ^I_m
 ,  

&& ^I_+ ( ( F^I - _m ^I ^m ) )_

Then, the Lagrangian LagrangianSuper2  becomes a simple form,

and can be gauged away easily by using STransf3 . 
The field redefinition FieldRedefineSuper

Supersymmetric generalized Chern-Simons action 

In this subsection we will show that 
a part of the Lagrangian LagrangianSuper , 
LagrangianGCSsuper 
_sGCS   =   
^I  __I
- ^I _I
 ,
is a kind of the supersymmetric version of 
the generalized Chern-Simons Lagrangian.

We here propose 
the supersymmetric generalized Chern-Simons theory 
in two dimensions. 
The Lagrangian of 
the supersymmetric generalized Chern-Simons theory is 
LagrangianGCSsuper2 
_sGCS   =   
 (   +   ) 
             + ^2 L
 ,
where 
GCSrepsuper1 
 =   _  ^    ,
      
_ =   T_a  _^a          ,
      
L =   ^ .
The Lagrangian LagrangianGCSsuper2  is invariant 
under the local gauge transformation:
&=& [ , U ] 
 ,


_&=& _U + [ _, U ] -  , _
 ,


L&=&   
                   +   +   
                   + [ L, U ] - [ , Q ]
 ,
where 
GCSrepsuper2 
U       =  T_a  U^a                       ,
      
_ =  W_^ ,
      
Q   =   T'_a'  Q^a'                       .
Note that 
 and  
are not Grassmannian. 

By the following identification, 
_1  &=&   x^0 _0 
 ,        
_2  =   x^1 _1 
 ,


_1  &=&    x^0 B_0 
 , 
_2  =    x^1 B_1 
 ,


L&=&  _12     =    x^0  x^1 C_01  
 ,
we find that 
the supersymmetric version of the generalized Chern-Simons Lagrangian 
proposed above is equivalent to 
the generalized Chern-Simons Lagrangian. 
Namely, 
the algebraic structure of both theories are the same.
In the supersymmetric generalized Chern-Simons theory 
the matrix  plays a role of the wedge product  
in the generalized Chern-Simons theory.
The supercovariant derivative  corresponds to 
the external derivative , 
so the property  corresponds to 
. 
Thus, one can expect that 
-dimensional generalized Chern-Simons theory 
will be deeply related with 
-dimensional supersymmetric 
generalized Chern-Simons theory. 

In order to obtain LagrangianGCSsuper  
from the general expression LagrangianGCSsuper2 , 
one chooses the representation GCSrepresentation , i.e. 
&=& _I ^I + 
           _+ [ _I , _J ] 
           ^IJ 
 ,


_&=& _+ _I ^I_ ,


 L&=& _+ 
 ,
and 
U &=& _+ _I U^I 
 ,


_&=& _+ W_ ,


Q   &=& _+ Q 
 ,
where 
 and 
. 
As the same as in the bosonic case, 
 and  are decoupled.


The gauge fixing of   supersymmetric model 

Using the gauge transformations STransf3 , 
one easily finds that 
the gauge parameters 
, , , 
, , ,   
gauge away the fields 
, , , 
, , , , respectively.  
By this gauge fixing 
the Lagrangian LagrangianSuper3  is unchanged 
because the fields 
, , , 
, , ,   
do not exist in the Lagrangian. 
The gauge transformation STransf2  is also unchanged 
by the same reason. 


Finally, 
let us perform the integration of , , and . 
This procedure gives simple equations of motion, 
, , and , 

because they are decoupled. 
Then, we find 
 ^2  
&=&  
-  ^m ^I _m _I 
- i 2  ^I ^m _m _I 



&&
+  ( ^m _m ^I + i ^I )  _I
+ ^mI  _m _I
- ^I _I                 
 .  The gauge transformation for each component is 
^I &=& ^I
 ,  

^I_&=& ^I
 ,  

_m &=& _m + _m ^n _n v
 ,  

_&=& (^m _m )_ ,  

^I &=& 0
 ,  



^I_m &=& 
                   _m ^n _n u^I 
                   + _m ^I - v  _m ^n _n ^I
                   - i _m ^I - _m ^I
 ,  

&=& _m ^m 
               + _m ^m - _m ^m
               + 2 i 
 .  The Lagrangian LagrangianSuper4  does not have 
off-shell supersymmetry any more, 
but is still off-shell invariant 
under the gauge transformation STransf4 . 
The remaining gauge parameters are 
, , , , and .
It should be noted that 
the generalized Chern-Simons term in LagrangianSuper4 
does not have the supersymmetric counterparts. 
This means that the supersymmetry does not lead us to 
a new topological feature 
concerning the generalized Chern-Simons term 
appeared in this model.

As the same as in the   bosonic model, 
using the global Poincare ISO(,1) symmetry 
and the internal symmetry, 
the solution auxiliaryfieldSolution  is achieved 
from the equations of motion without loss of generality. 
Then, the Lagrangian LagrangianSuper4  becomes 
LagrangianLCsuper 
 =   
-   ^m ^I _m _I 
- i 2  ^I ^m _m _I 
+ 1    
( ^m _m ^-   + i ^-   )
 ,
which is the supersymmetric version of LagrangianLC . 
In the case of the solution auxiliaryfieldSolution , 
the gauge transformation 
 and  in STransf4  
make us possible to choose 
the light-cone-like gauge fixing condition, 
LightConeSuper 
^+     =   0 
 ,       
^+  _= 0
 .
The gauge fields  and  play roles of 
Lagrange multipliers. 

  Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond type Superstring 

In this subsection we consider 
the   supersymmetric model coupled to 2D supergravity, 
which is equivalent to 
the Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond type of 
  superstring model. 

The dynamical variables of 2D supergravity are 
a vielbein  and 
a connection , 
where  (, ; , ) 
is a tangent space index, 
and 
generatorSO2 
_A ^B   =  
    ( ) 
is the generator of SO(1,1) tangent group.
The kinematical constraints on the torsion 
 
areTorsionlessCondition2DN1 
T_  ^a(z)  =  2 i (^a)_ 
 ,       
T_bc  ^a(z)  =  T_  ^(z)  =  0
 .
Other torsion components are determined 
from the constraints TorsionlessCondition2DN1 .

The Lagrangian for 
the   supersymmetric model coupled to supergravity is 
LagrangianSuperGravity 
 =   E  (
- ^^I __I 

+ ^_I _^I 
+ ^I  __I
- ^I _I  )
 ,
where 

. 
The background metric  is FlatmetricDefinitionGravity . 
This Lagrangian is invariant 
under the local super   transformations, 
the supergeneral coordinate transformations,
the local Lorentz transformations, and 
the super-Weyl scaling as follows:
^I &=&   ^I

E_M ^a       &=&

  K^N _N _M + _M K^N _N + _M L

  + E_M ^( )_ ^_S
 , where ,  and  are local parameters for 
the supergeneral coordinate transformation, 
the local Lorentz transformations, and 
the super-Weyl transformation, respectively. 
The gauge transformation LocalGaugeTransfSuperGravity  
has on-shell reducibility 
as the same as the gauge transformation LocalGaugeTransfSuper .
The transformation LocalGaugeTransfSuperGravity  
has on-shell invariance under the two-dimensional covariant form 
of the local gauge transformation LocalGaugeTransfSuper2 . 
The two-dimensional covariant form is obtained 
by replacing  by . 
The Lagrangian LagrangianSuperGravity  is also invariant 
under the global transformations GlobalGaugeTransfSuper  
and the discrete transformations 
DiscreteTransfSuper1  and DiscreteTransfSuper2 , 
where  
are harmonic functions on 2D superspace which satisfy 
 
(). 
The Poincare symmetry is ISO(,2). 

At the quantum level, 
the absence of superconformal anomaly requires . 
The   superstring model consists of 
one graviton (), one gravitino (), 
one photon (), one photino (), 
 scalar particles (), 
and 
 spinor particles (). 
Therefore, 
the total conformal charge of   superstring model is 
w^(N=1)  
&=&  2  (-13) + 2  11 2  + 
     2  (-1) + 2  (-1 2 ) + 
     D  (1 + 1 2 )


&=&  3 2  ( D - 12 ) 
 . The fields , , and  
do not contribute to the conformal charge 
because these fields come from the generalized Chern-Simons action 
which is considered to be topological. 
The cancellation of superconformal anomaly, i.e. 
the existence of the super-Weyl symmetry at the quantum level 
requires . 
Thus, we obtain  from ConformalWeightSuper . 


  Green-Schwarz type Superstring 

In this section we try to study 
the Green-Schwarz typeof   superstring model. 
This model has a kind of manifest supersymmetry 
in the background target space-time. 
Thus, one needs 
not only the background space-time coordinate , 
but also 12 dimensional fermionic spinor coordinates 
 and . 
Similar to the Green-Schwarz superstring model, 
we require  and  to be 
scalar fields in two-dimensional field theory
and Majorana-Weyl spinors in 12 dimensions. 
Note that it is possible to require 
both Majorana condition and Weyl condition in 12 dimensions 
at the same time owing to the existence of two time coordinates
. 
In order to obtain the supersymmetry, 
the number of bosonic freedoms and 
that of fermionic freedoms are set to be equal. 
So, 
the gauge transformation 
 and  will lead us to 
the light-cone-like gauge fixing conditions, 
LightConeTheta 
^+   ^1   =   0   ,       
^+   ^2   =   0   ,
as the same as 
LightConeBosonic  and LightConeSuper . 

Since the way how to covariantize the Lagrangian is the same as 
that in the bosonic type and 
that in the Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond type, 
we here give the final expression. 
The covariant Lagrangian of 
the Green-Schwarz type of   superstring model is(
A similar Lagrangian is obtained in, 
but the gauge structure is different.
Not only   symmetry but also -symmetry 
play essential roles in our model.

GlobalSusyGSstring  twice, 
one obtains 
GSstringTranslation 
^I   =  
- i ( ^1 ^I _J ^1  + 
      ^2 ^I _J ^2  ) ^J   .
This means that the background supersymmetry in this model is 
slightly different from 
the standard super-Poincare ISO(10,2) symmetry 
because there is no translation to the direction . 

Finally, we summarize the global symmetries in the following. 
&&i)

           otherwise unchanged.  
It should be noted that 
there is no counterpart of the discrete symmetry 
DiscreteTransfBosonic2  or DiscreteTransfSuper2  
in the Green-Schwarz type of   superstring. 
This fact means unfortunately that 
it is not so straightforward to understand the equivalence of 
the Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond type and the Green-Schwarz type of 
  superstring. 
Anyway, in order to show the equivalence, 
one needs to perform the quantization of both theories. 


Discussions and Conclusions  

The form of Lagrangian LagrangianBosonicGravityModified  
suggests us that 
the Lagrangian LagrangianBosonicGravityModified  
will be naturally extended to the Lagrangian of 
higher dimensional object like membrane or -brane. 
For example, 
, 
 and 
 
in EOMBosonic  are obtained by 
the compactification on the internal space-time with condition 
, where  is constant. 
The -symmetry is considered to be the third component of 
the -symmetry. 
Thus, the extension from   string to (2,2)-brane(
  The world-sheet swept by string is 
  the space-time with metric (,),
  on the other hand, 
  the world-volume swept by (2,2)-brane is 
  the space-time with metric (,,,).
) 
is one of the natural ways. 


































It is easy to extend the supersymmetry to  supersymmetry. 
In the case of 
the    superstring model, 
the total conformal charge is 
w^(N=2)   &=&  
2  (-13) + 4  11 2  + 2  (-1)


&&+  
2  (-1) + 4  (-1 2 ) + 2  (-1) + 
2D  (1 + 1 2 ) 


&=&  3 ( D - 4 ) 
 . The cancellation of superconformal anomaly, i.e. 
the super-Weyl symmetry at the quantum level 
requires . 
Thus, we obtain  from ConformalWeightSuper2 . 
It should be noted that 
the background space-time has two time coordinates, i.e. 
. 



The followings are the conclusions. 
We have succeeded in obtaining 
the covariant expression of   models 
proposed in ref. , 
which are bosonic and supersymmetric models 
without and with (super)gravity. 
The   bosonic and supersymmetric models without gravity 
have ISO(,1) Poincare symmetry (). 
The   bosonic and supersymmetric models with gravity, 
i.e. the   bosonic string and superstring models 
have ISO(26,2) and ISO(10,2) Poincare symmetry, respectively. 
We also obtain the Green-Schwarz type of   superstring model. 
It is also possible to construct 
the   heterotic superstring by using usual method.
In any cases 
the generalized Chern-Simons term plays an important role 
to covariantize the Lagrangian. 

The form of covariantized Lagrangian 
in the   (super)string models 
suggests 
that these models are defined naturally by 
more than two-dimensional field theories, 
namely, 
that membrane or -brane is more fundamental 
than string in these models. 
The   string models are the first examples which 
suggest higher dimensional object 
like membrane or -brane 
in the framework of perturbative field theory 
without using the concept of string duality". 

The relation between the   superstring model, 
M-theory, and F-theory is unfortunately still unclear. 
Though M-theory is a kind of membrane theory, 
it does not have ISO(10,2) Poincare symmetry. 
So, the   superstring model will be directly related with 
F-theory which has ISO(10,2) Poincare symmetry 
and is considered to be based on (2,2)-brane.
