Minkowski space can be sliced, outside the lightcone, in terms of
Euclidean Anti-de Sitter and Lorentzian de Sitter slices. In this
paper we investigate what happens when we apply holography to each
slice separately. This yields a dual description living on two
spheres, which can be interpreted as the boundary of the light
cone. The infinite number of slices gives rise to a continuum
family of operators on the two spheres for each separate bulk
field.
For a free field we explain how the Green's function and
(trivial) S-matrix in Minkowski space can be reconstructed in terms of
two-point functions of some putative conformal field theory on the
two spheres. Based on this we propose a Minkowski/CFT correspondence
which can also be applied to interacting fields.
We comment on the interpretation of the
conformal symmetry of the CFT, and on generalizations to curved
space.

Introduction 



 and has found a concrete
and quantitative realization in string theory in terms of the
AdS/CFT correspondence. Since then, many
generalizations have been found, but all of these are deformations
of, or limits of, the AdS/CFT correspondence. There have been
attempts to generalize the AdS/CFT correspondence to de Sitter
space (this was first discussed in and) but
unfortunately string theory on de Sitter space, the dual field
theory and the precise form of the correspondence are not well
understood.

Besides Anti-de Sitter space and de Sitter space, which are
solutions of the Einstein equations with negative and positive
cosmological constant, there is a third class of spaces, namely
those with zero cosmological constant. In particular, Minkowski
space belongs to this class, and one may wonder what one can say
about the existence and nature of a holographic dual description.
There are local versions of entropy bounds that
also apply to Minkowski space, but these provide no specific
insight about any dual description. An alternative approach is to
take the decompactification limit of the AdS/CFT correspondence
. Though this is in principle a viable procedure,
it has not led to an explicit dual description.

In this paper we will try something different. Minkowski space
with metric
 
has three regions depending on whether , , or
, with
 
The regions with  and  correspond to the inside and
the outside of the light-cone respectively, whereas  is the
light-cone itself. For a fixed value of , equation
() describes a slice of Minkowski space whose geometry is
either Euclidean anti-de Sitter, flat or Lorentzian de Sitter. The
idea will be to apply holography to each slice separately, and in
this way to effectively reduce the number of dimensions by one.
All slices asymptote to the past or future light-cone, and
therefore all dual field theories live on two d-spheres, which can
be thought of as the boundaries of the past and future light-cone.
It would appear as if we have lost two dimensions instead of one,
but because of the infinite number of slices, we get an infinite
number of fields on the two spheres, and this effectively
reinstates one of the two lost dimensions. However, we cannot
simply interpret the infinite number of fields as coming from a KK
reduction of a theory in one dimension higher. The asymptotics of
the metric () suggest that the extra dimension is a null
dimension. Instead of trying to make sense of theories living on a
space with a degenerate metric, we will mostly work directly with the
infinite set of fields itself.

There are some obvious problems with this procedure. First of all,
Minkowski space has de Sitter slices, and a holographic reduction
along those slices requires us to apply the ill-understood dS/CFT
correspondence. Luckily, for the purposes in this paper, we will
only need some basic information like the form of two-point
functions, and these are almost completely fixed by the symmetries
of de Sitter space. Ultimately, if this whole procedure turns out
to be consistent, one may try to reverse the logic and try to use
known properties of Minkowski space in order to study holography
for de Sitter space, but that is beyond the scope of the present
paper.

Another problem is the presence of the light-cone itself. Only
non-interacting massless fields can spend their entire life inside
the light-cone, but there are few if any of such degrees of
freedom so it seems completely safe to leave the light-cone itself
outside the discussion.

Despite these problems, we will find some encouraging results. For
a free field we explain how the Green's function and S-matrix in
Minkowski space can be reconstructed in terms of two-point
functions of some putative conformal field theory on the two
spheres. That this is at all possible is related to the following
fact. Consider two points  and  on Minkowski space, with
 and . Of crucial importance is the
distance  between  and , which is given by
 For simplicity we assume that 
and  have the same sign. Then  and
 are coordinates on the same (anti)de Sitter
space. Clearly,

Now the geodesic distance on (anti)de Sitter space is a function
of  only, and we see that the geodesic
distance in Minkowski space is a function of ,  and the
geodesic distance in (anti)de Sitter space only. This fact is
essential in relating Minkowski space quantities to correlation
functions in the CFT's.

The emerging picture is rather intriguing. It suggests that it must
be possible to completely re-formulate the  Quantum Field
Theory in Minkowski space entirely in terms of correlation
functions of a set of conformal operators associated with the past and future
of the light-cone. We consider this as
a step towards a better understanding of the holography
(well established in anti-de Sitter spacetime) in asymptotically flat
space-times.

An important element in formulation of a holographic duality is the
identification of the underlying conformal symmetry.
In asymptotically anti-de Sitter spaces
this symmetry arises as asymptotic symmetry
near the time-like infinity.  The class of asymptotically flat
spaces and the respective symmetries near the null-infinity
(where the holographic dual could naively be thought to live) were
studied long ago in (see alsoand for a related discussion of the space-like infinity). 
The group of
symmetries is the so-called BMS group, an infinite dimensional
abelian group, which does not contain the relevant conformal
group. The idea pushed forward in this paper is to look at the
infinity of the light-cone and uncover the asymptotic symmetries
there. The allowed set of spaces is larger than the set of
asymptotically flat spaces, and the group of asymptotic symmetries
contains the BMS group but also the conformal group. The
appearance of the conformal symmetry in this case is quite
transparent. It is just an extension of the well-studied conformal
symmetry near the boundary of a anti-de Sitter slice to a symmetry
near the boundary of the light-cone in Minkowski space. The price
to pay for all this is that translation invariance of Minkowski
space is not manifest, but takes a much more complicated form.

The outline of this paper is as follows. In section 2 we discuss
in more detail the slicing of Minkowski space-time and its
properties. In section 3 we consider free massless scalar fields,
and their reduction on each of the slices. In section 4 we
consider the finite part of the on-shell action for a free scalar
field, and will see that the structure suggests the presence of
conformal correlation functions in Minkowski space quantities. In
section 5 we will make the relation between correlation functions
in the conformal field theory and bulk quantities more precise,
and we use this to reconstruct the Minkowski space S-matrix and
Green's function. In section 6 we look at more general spaces. We
introduce an appropriate notion of asymptotically Minkowski space,
analyze the symmetries that preserve these asymptotics. We also
examine the way conformal symmetries are implemented and whether
it is meaningful to view the infinite set of conformal operators
as fields living in a space with one additional dimension, and
comment on the meaning of translation invariance and the BMS
group. In section 7 we study gravity in Minkowski space, and how
the space-time metric is encoded in data on the two spheres.
Finally, we present some conclusions and further speculations.

The idea is to substitute ()-() into the action (),
first take the integration over   and then take the limit  of infinite .

there could  be extra

have not been able to prove this. 
The delta-function  in
() can be recognized in the asymptotics () of the
kernels  (note, that 
we also omitted the terms proportional to  which 
constribute to the oscillating part of the action). With the help of this formula
we find that the finite part of the action, after the integrations
over  and  have been performed, is given by

so that various complex conjugates will appear in ().
If we were to follow the usual AdS/CFT story, we would interpret

(both with conformal weight ).
Equation () would then indicate that there is a  non-trivial
correlation function between the  operators
 and  and that it takes
the form of a conformal two-point function on the d-sphere.
Again, this is all suggestive but quite imprecise.

A similar analysis can be done  in regions  and
. By finally considering the action on all of Minkowski space
we arrive at a functional

on the two d-spheres  and 
respectively.
The variation with respect to  and then with respect to

is naturally interpreted as a correlation function between operators living on
 and . The interesting question arises whether
those correlation functions have anything to do with the S-matrix
in Minkowski space (once we include interactions).
We will return to this and other questions in the next section,
where we will set up a more precise version of the Minkowski/CFT
correspondence.


Green's functions and  S-matrix in 

 Minkowski spacetime 



The manifestation of the conformal structure of correlation
functions associated with the asymptotic boundaries of the
light-cone which we studied in the previous section was
suggestive.  The emergence of conformal structures becomes however
clearer and more precise if we study the asymptotic behavior of
the propagator in Minkowski spacetime.

For simplicity we start with the free field and consider the Hadamard  type
propagator
defined as



In (d+2)-dimensional Minkowski space it takes the form
D(X,X')=_d(s^2)^d/2    ,   s^2=-(X_0-X_0')^2+ (X -X ')^2  ,
p0 
where  is the space-time interval between two events and 
.

Let both points lie in the region  foliated by de Sitter
slices. The foliation is given by coordinates 
that are related to the coordinates of Minkowski space as follows
X_0=r  ,  X   = r n  ()  ,
X 
where  is d-dimensional unit vector parametrized
The distance between two points with coordinates 
and  is
s^2=r^2+r'^2-2rr'  ,
p1 
where  is the geodesic distance on de Sitter space between
the points  and 
(p2 
where  is the angle between the unit
vectors  and , which at the
same time is the geodesic distance on the d-sphere. Note that
 for space-like intervals on de Sitter space while
 for time-like intervals. In the latter case
 in () and () becomes 
.

Substituting () into () and expanding in powers of 
we recognize a  generating function for Gegenbauer polynomials




The infinite sum can be represented as a single contour integral
so that we have the following  useful representation for the
Hadamard function
D(X,X')=-i2 _d _c-i ^c+i  r^- r'^C^d/2 _-  (-)d()   ,
p3 
where the constant  should satisfy the condition . We
can choose  so that the integral is over
 where  changes from minus to plus
infinity. These values of  are natural because they
appear in the decomposition of plane waves as we saw in section 3.

The propagator is now represented in terms of Gegenbauer functions
which for arbitrary  are defined in terms of the
hypergeometric function as




When two points on a slice approach each other the geodesic
distance  goes to zero and the argument in Gegenbauer
function approaches -1. Therefore, the argument in the
hypergeometric function goes  to . This is the point where the
hypergeometric function  has a singularity,

. For the
hypergeometric function in the definition of Gegenbauer function
we have . Thus, when 
approaches zero Gegenbauer function in () has singularity



which depends only on the dimension  but not on  .
This is exactly the expected behavior of  Green's function.
Indeed, the Gegenbauer function  is
related to the   de Sitter invariant Green's function defined as




where , of the field operator ,
. The exact relation is
C^d/2 _- (-z)=4^d/2 (d2 ) ()  
D_(z)  .
CD 
Obviously, . Equation ()
then takes the especially simple form
D(X,X')=12i _c-i ^c+i 
d  r^- r'^D_()
DD 
which shows how the Green's function in -dimensional
Minkowski spacetime is decomposed in terms of the infinite set of
Green's functions on the -dimensional de Sitter slice
parametrized by .

In region , inside the light-cone, we choose the
coordinate system  as follows
X_0=ty  ,   X   = ty  n  ()  .
X1 
The Minkowski distance in this region  takes the form
s^2=-(t^2 +t'^2-2tt')  ,
p4 
where  is the geodesic distance on Euclidean anti-de
Sitter space defined as
=y y'-y y' (,p5 
and as before  is the geodesic distance
on the unit d-sphere. The propagator in this region has a
decomposition similar to (),
D(X,X')=(-i)^d  2i 
_c-i ^c+i d  t^-  t'^D_() ,p6 
in terms of an infinite set of Green's functions 
 on the anti-de Sitter slices.

In Quantum Field Theory a special role is played by the Feynman
propagator which in Minkowski space is given by
D_F (X,X')=_d i(s^2+i)^d/2  
p10 
with the appropriate -prescription showing that the
propagator is analytic in the upper half-plane as a function of
the invariant distance . This translates directly into a
corresponding prescription for the propagators on the de Sitter
slices once we use the decomposition (). We find for the
Feynman-like propagator  as function of the
de-Sitter invariance distance  that



This gives the correct Feynman prescription for going around the
 singularity in the propagator on de Sitter spacetime.

It is now our goal to see how the Feynman propagator in Minkowski
space behaves when the two points approach the boundaries at
infinity of the light-cone. Suppose that one of the points
approaches the future infinity of the light-cone, i.e. the sphere
, from the side of the region . In this case we have
 and the de Sitter geodesic distance
behaves in this limit as




Using the known properties (available in) of the
hypergeometric function when its argument approaches infinity we
find that as 





This expression contains factors 
. When now the second point
is taken either to the future infinity ()
or to the past infinity ( of the
light-cone these factors produce non-trivial distributions on the
d-sphere (see Apendix A for details)

where the integration over  goes from  to .
A similar expression appears when .

Notice that the first term in () looks like a conformal
correlation function on one of the boundaries () of the
light-cone, similar to the expression we found in the previous
section. From a holographic point of view, it is a correlation
function between operators associated with modes
 and 
. On the other hand, we find that the correlation functions
of the operators associated with the modes
 and
 produce contact terms
proportional to a delta-function on the d-sphere.

When one of the points approaches the future infinity of the light-cone

This also takes the form of correlation functions between
conformal operators living on  and : the correlation
function diverges for antipodal points on d-sphere. This is
similar to the behavior for two point functions in de Sitter space
as discussed in. The functions
, ,  and  are
expressed in terms of the Gamma function as follows
&&A()=2^i 4^d2 +1

&&D()=2^(-i)^(24^d2 +1  ()(d2 -) ,  
F()=2^d (-i)^(d-1) 4 (d2 -)
(d2 )  .
ABDF 
We can repeat this analysis in the case when  either of the  infinities
of the light-cone is
approached from the side of the region .
It is useful to note that the coordinate systems ()
and () are related by the analytic transformation
&&D A _+:ri t  ,  y-i2   ,  

&&D A _-:r-i t  ,
  -y+i2   ,  p7 
Using the analytic continuation () between regions 
 and  one can demonstrate that the structure of the
conformal correlation functions () and () is the
same no matter from which side each point approaches the boundary
of the light-cone. Thus, the structure of the conformal
correlators emerging in () and () is an intrinsic
property of the boundaries ( and ) themselves.

Incidentally, in de Sitter space there is a one-parameter family
of vacua usually called -vacua, and one may wonder which
vacuum state is natural once de Sitter space is embedded in
Minkowski space. According to, the natural de
Sitter vacuum to use in this context is the Bunch-Davies vacuum or
the Euclidean vacuum. We have not verified whether the form of
() is consistent with the two-point functions in the
Euclidean vacuum as derived in, or
whether it corresponds to a different value of , but
clearly it would be interesting to investigate this.

In- and out-fields 

The standard decomposition of asymptotic fields  in terms of plane waves
is
(X_0,X )=dk (a(k  ) f_k(X_0,X  )
+a^ (k  )f^*_k(X_0,X  ))  ,
p11 
where the functions
f_k(X_0,X  )=1[(2)^d+1 2k]^1/2  e^-i(kX_0-k X ) 
fk 
form a basis of (positive frequency) asymptotic fields. The
(d+1)-vector  is parametrized by its length
 and angles  which
determine the direction of the vector in momentum space. Hence we
have , where
 is unit vector providing the direction. The
creation and annihilation operators satisfy the usual algebra
[a(k  ),a^ (k'  )]=^(d+1) (k  , k'  )=1k^d (k-k') 
^(d) (_k,_k' )  ,
p12 
where  is the delta-function
on the d-sphere with respect to the standard measure 
.

In the region  the coordinates  are given by ()
so that the argument in the  exponent in () can be written in the form



Using this expression and formula () we
obtain a representation of the plane waves
e^i(kX_0-k  X  ) =12i _c-i ^c+i 
d (i)^()k^-  (ti)^- 
(y-y(,_k))^   ,
p13 
where the -prescription determines the way to go around
the  singularity. With the help of this representation we can
obtain an explicit  decomposition of the asymptotic field
() in terms of data on the boundary of the light-cone.

Consider the region  in which the coordinate .
With the help of () the asymptotic field () has
the form
(t,y,)=12i _d/2-i ^d/2+i 
d t^- _S^+_d d(_k)  G_() (y,,_k)
 ^(d-)  (_k)  ,
p14 
where
G_() (y,,_k)=
g()(y-y(,_k))^ 
p15 
is the bulk-boundary propagator on Euclidean anti-de Sitter
introduced in (). The family of functions (parametrized
by )
^(d-)  (_k)=2^d2 (d2 )2^12  
_0^dk k^(d-12 ) (e^-i2   a(k,_k)+
e^i2   a^ (k,_k))
p16 
can be thought of as the  boundary data on the boundary  of
the future light-cone. Equation () thus gives us a
solution to a quite peculiar boundary problem and shows how the
field in (d+2)-dimensional space-time can be reconstructed from
data on a co-dimension two surface lying at the boundary at
infinity of the light-cone.

The algebra () induces the algebra of the operators
() and we obtain for their vacuum expectation values
&&<0^(d-)  (_k)^(d-(_k')0>

&&=
2^d4 (d2 )(d2 ) (-i)^i^2i  (+(d) (_k,_k')  .
p17 
Using this we can compute the vacuum expectation value of the
asymptotic fields () and we find that
&&<0(t,y,),(t',y',

&&C()=2^d2  (d2 )  (d2 -)  (2 (d-2))  .
p18 
Equation () is another representation for the Hadamard
function (). Comparing these  two expressions we find a
representation for the anti-de Sitter bulk-bulk propagator
 in terms of the bulk-boundary propagator
(). This representation is rather natural from the point
of view of anti-de Sitter space.

In the region  where the coordinate  there exists
a representation for the asymptotic field which is similar to
(): one should just switch signs appropriately according
to the -prescription in ().

In region  foliated by de Sitter slices the coordinates
 are given by () and we have that




The expression for the plane waves then reads
e^i(kX_0-k  X  ) =12i _c-i ^c+i 
d (i)^()k^-  r^- 
(-(,_k) i)^   .
p19 
The kernel appearing in () is singular and ambiguous. The
 in () provides the appropriate way to deal
with the singularity in the kernel. The asymptotic behavior of
such kernels is given by () and ().
Using those asymptotics we define the bulk to boundary propagator
near the boundary at future infinity of the light-cone as follows
G^out _ (,,g()  (-i)^d-2 (-(,) +i)^   .
Gkern 
The bulk-boundary propagator near the boundary at past infinity is
defined as
G^in _(,,g()  (-i)^d (+(,) -i)^   .
Gkernin 
We should note that the -prescription used to define the
decomposition of the plane waves (see () and ())
is in general not analytic under the transformation ()
between regions  and . We find that modes
 with  are analytic across the future light-cone
while modes  with  are analytic across the past
light-cone.


Conformal operators 

The analysis of the
previous subsection suggests that  one can define the conformal operators
as associated with the asymptotic (possibly, interacting in the bulk)
in- and out- quantum fields. For the out-field the representation is
_+ (r,,)=12i _d2 -i ^d2 +i 
d( ^<_(r,)  
_out  O ^<_()
+^>_(r,) _out  O ^>_() )  .
p20 
For the in-field we have a similar representation in
terms of the in-operators
_12i _d2 -i ^d2 +i 
d(^>_(r,) _in  O ^>_()
+^<_(r,) _in  O ^<_())  .
p21 
The asymptotic modes which are right-moving as a function of
 on the ()-plane are labelled by the
subscript  while the left-moving modes are labelled by . The
functions
^<_(r,)=N^-1 _ r^- e^-  ,  
^>_(r,)=N^-1 _ i^r^- e^-(d-) 
modes-out 
form the basis of out-modes and the functions
^>_(r,)=N^-1 _ r^- e^  ,  
^<_(r,)=N^-1 _ i^- e^(d-) 
modes-in 
form the basis of the in-modes on the -plane. In
the region  the respective modes are those obtained from
() and () by means of the analytic
continuation (). The conformal operators so defined are
associated with the boundary of the light-cone at infinity and are
independent of the side ( or ) from which the
boundary is approached.

Since  plays the role of time in the de Sitter foliation of
Minkowski space it can be used  to define positive and negative
frequencies. Representing  where
 is a real parameter we then find that the positive
frequency modes are , ,
 and , all with
 positive. Inversion of the sign of  (or
equivalently taking the complex conjugate) then gives the
negative-frequency modes. The constant  is given by



The positive frequency modes then are normalized as
(f _,f _i  (norm 
where  stands for any of the positive frequency modes
we defined above. The inner product is given by the usual
Klein-Gordon expression
(f ,g )=()^d_0^dr  r^d-1 f ^*
 i_  g   ,
product 
where  for the out-operators and
 for in-operators.

For the operators defined in () and ()  we have
that  and 
. This implies that the in-
and out-operators  and  
couple to positive-frequency modes while  and
 couple to negative-frequency modes. This
definition of the positive and negative frequencies is different
from the definition based on the global time coordinate . The
difference between two is  reminiscent of the well-known relation
between the Rindler and Minkowski definitions of time in Rindler
spacetime. The corresponding modes are related by a Bogoliubov
transform. As is seen from () the modes which have
positive frequency in the sense of the time-like vector
 decompose onto both negative and positive
frequency modes in the sense of de Sitter time vector
. It would be interesting to understand better the
implications of this observation. Note also that the definition of
the conformal operators given in () and () is
reminiscent of the analysis of section 4.

The operation inverse to the  spectral integration in (),
() is the direct Mellin transform



so that  can be thought of as a field
living on de Sitter space with coordinates . On
the other hand the kernels 
 and 
 given in () and ()
can be used to project( There are two terms in the
asymptotic expansion of 
, see () and ().
In order for the term with the delta-function to dominate we take
 and take  to zero
afterwards.)  the field  onto modes
asymptotic to  and .
These two operations can be used to derive the insertion of the
in- and out-conformal operators in terms of the (in general
interacting) bulk Feynman  Green's function in the form of an
integral over a hypersurface of constant . For the
out-operators it is the surface at  while for the
in-operators  we should take the surface at . The
insertion prescriptions are
&&<0..  _in  O ^<_() ..0>= 

&&_- 
_0^dr r^N^-1 _ i^d- _S^-_d  d(()^d
D_F (..,(r,, _  G^in _d-  (,,

_0^dr r^N^-1 _ i^d- _S^+_d  d(()^d
G^out _d-  (,, _ 
D_F (..,(r,,
p25 
for the out-operators. Near the boundary ( or ) of the
light-cone the coordinate  plays the role of a coordinate
enumerating the de Sitter slices ending at the surface  (or
). Thus, in the above formulas an insertion effectively takes
place at each of the de Sitter slices separately, after which one
sums over all de Sitter slices labelled by .

These expressions are very similar to the ones introduced in
 for the insertion of boundary conformal
operators in the case of de Sitter space. The field 
 obtained from  by the
Mellin transform in the variable  describes a field on de
Sitter space with mass equal , so perhaps
this is not too surprising. Nevertheless, it is interesting to
observe that computing the on-shell action (as we attempted in
section 4) is not very satisfactory, whereas the S-matrix approach
in this section gives a concise proposal for a Minkowski/CFT
duality as in (), just as in de Sitter space.

Inside the light-cone, in the region , the insertions can
be defined in a similar way as in (), (),
(), (). The appropriate surface is then the
boundary at  of each anti-de Sitter slice and one has
to integrate over contributions of all such slices, which
translates into an integral over negative  for the 
-operators and over positive  for the -operators.
On an anti-de Sitter slice we could use the definition of the
conformal correlation functions built out of bulk-boundary
propagators and truncated n-point Feynman Green's function on the
slice, as familiar from AdS/CFT, see,
. Notice that even on the Anti-de
Sitter slices computing an on-shell action is not the right
approach, because of the complex values of the conformal weights,
and therefore even on the AdS slices we should resort to an
S-matrix type approach like the one discussed in
.

The integration over  adds up the contributions of all AdS
slices. The explicit form of the insertions in region  can
be obtained by applying the analytic transformation () to
()-().

It appears that correlation functions defined in this way do not
depend on the choice of region (inside or outside the light-cone)
which is used to define the insertions and are therefore an
intrinsic property of the boundary of the light-cone. The 2-point
correlation functions between - and -operators
are now found to be equal to
<0 _out  O ^<__1  (_1) 
_in  O ^>__2  (_2)0> = 2i (_1+_2-d) ^(d) (_1,N__1  N__2  F(_2)
p26 
<0 _out  O ^>__1  (_1) 
_in  O ^<__2  (_2)0> = 2i (_1+_2-d) ^(d) (_1,_2) i^d N__1  N__2  F(_1)
p27 
<0 _out  O ^>__1  (_1) 
_in  O ^>__2  (_2)0> = 2i (_1+_2-d) i^d-_2  N__1  N__2  D(_2)(1+(_1,_2))^_2  
p28 
<0 _out  O ^<__1  (_1) 
_in  O ^<__2  (_2)0> = 2i (_1+_2-d) i^d-_1  N__1  N__2  D(_1)(1+(_1,_2))^_1    .
p29 
Thus, the set of CFT operators splits into two groups: operators
 representing the right-moving modes and operators
 representing the left-moving modes. The correlation
functions of operators of the same group take a standard CFT form
(), () on a d-sphere. On the other hand,
operators from different groups produce contact terms in the
correlators (), (). Note that contact type
correlation functions are also consistent with conformal
invariance.

S-matrix 

It is well-known that in Minkowski space the S-matrix of
interacting quantum fields can be reconstructed from bulk
correlation functions via the so-called LSZ construction. A
natural question arises whether it is possible to reproduce the
S-matrix by means of only the light-cone correlation functions of
conformal operators introduced in section 5.3. That this may be
the case is suggested by the analysis made in de Sitter space
 where it was shown that the de Sitter
analog of an S-matrix indeed can be presented in terms of CFT
correlation functions between operators living at the infinite
past and future of de Sitter space. In anti-de Sitter a similar
construction was introduced in.

In order to analyze this possibility we consider the one-particle
amplitude whose LSZ form is given by a combination of integrating
over two surfaces, one lying in the infinite past and another in
the infinite future of Minkowski space,
&&<pq>=dV(X)Z   dV(Y)Z   f_q(X)  ^2 _X D_F (Y,X) ^2 _Y
f^*_p(Y)

&&=-_Y_0+ d(Y)_X_0n^_x 
f_q(X) _  D_F (Y,X) 
_ f^*_p(Y) n^_y  ,
p30 
where  is the standard normalization of the wave function and
 is the normal vector to the hypersurface in the infinite
past while  is the normal to the hypersurface in the
infinite future. The functions  are defined in ()
and form a basis of the set of asymptotic fields. We recall that
in momentum space the asymptotic spatial momentum  is
determined by its length  and angles  on a
d-sphere so that .

 
figure=pic2.eps   The asymptotic
hypersurfaces  and  are defined
in a small vicinity of the past and future infinity of the
light-cone respectively. 
For our purposes it is convenient to choose the asymptotic
hypersurfaces in a different way. Namely, we define the asymptotic
future and past hypersurfaces by 

 and 

 We see that these hypersurfaces are defined in the
vicinity of the boundary of the light-cone and consist of two
components: one in region  and another in region .
As we show in Appendix  the plane waves
 have the standard normalization with respect to the
Klein-Gordon inner product defined at these hypersurfaces. Thus,
 and  can be used to define
asymptotic states in the same fashion as the usual constant 
surfaces. With this definitions and these choices of asymptotic
surfaces the LSZ form of the one-particle amplitude () is
modified into
<pq>=__out   dZ  
__in   dZ  
f^*_p (X)  _n  D_F (X,X')
 _n'  f_q(X')  .
pq 
The asymptotic functions  and  can be decomposed
according to () in the region  and  ()
in the region . Inserting  this decomposition into
() and after some manipulations we recognize the two-point
functions defined in section 5.3. Consequently, the one-particle
amplitude takes the form
&&<pq>= p q (2i )^2 
d_1Z  d_2Z  
 p^-_1 q^-_2  H(_1) H(_2) 

&&<0 _out  O ^<_d-_1  (_p) 
_in  O ^>_d-_2  (  ,
p32 
where



and each -integration is from  to
. The function , once expressed in
terms of conformal operators, is not analytic across the future
light-cone. The jump is , which
explains the appearance of  in the
function . The same is true for the function 
near the boundary at infinity of the past light-cone. For free
fields the light-cone 2-point function in () is given by
() and after the integration over  and
 the usual expression
<pq> =  p^-d  (p-q) ^(d) (_p,_q)
amplitude 
is reproduced.  Although this calculation was performed for a free
field interaction is not expected to change the form of the
conformal correlation function in the amplitude (), but
only its normalization. Therefore the angle part of the amplitude
comes out in the same way as in () while the
-dependent pre-factor can be modified. Note that this is also
consistent with the restrictions imposed by bulk Lorentz
invariance on the structure of the one-particle amplitude.

The generalization of () to many-particle amplitudes is
straightforward. It is important to note that the amplitude
() is given in terms of the contact type correlation
functions of operators introduced in section 5.3.

In the construction of the scattering amplitudes () and
() the positive and negative frequency modes of the
asymptotic fields are defined with respect to the vector field
 which is a global time-like vector in Minkowski
space. Instead we could have chosen to use the time  on a de
Sitter slice to define the positive and negative frequency modes.
The basis of asymptotic fields then is given by the functions
() and (). These modes can be used to
form incoming () and outgoing  wavepackets as
f^>(r,,)=12i d 
^>_(r,) f^>_() ,  
f^<(r,,)=12i d 
^<_(r,) f^<_() , 

g^>(r,,)=12i d 
^>_(r,) g^>_() ,  
g^<(r,,)=12i d 
^<_(r,) g^<_() ,
p33 
where  () and
 () are smooth
functions on the spheres  and  respectively. In
order to make sure that only positive frequency modes contribute
to the wavepacket we demand that (provided that 
)  and 
 for , with similar conditions on the envelope
functions in the outgoing wavepacket. The operators 
and  corresponding to these wavepackets are recovered
from the asymptotic free field () (or ()) by the
standard formulas
b^> _f=_0^dr r^d-1 _S^-_d d()  ()^d  [f^> (r,,)]^*
i _  _in  (r,,)


b^> _g=_0^dr r^d-1 _S^+_d d()  ()^d  [g^> (r,,)]^*
i _  _out  (r,,)
p34 
with similar expressions for the left-moving modes. The S-matrix
elements for an incoming wavepacket  and an outcoming
wavepacket  are defined by
S[g^>,f^>]=<0b^>_g b^> _f0>  .
p35 
These matrix elements can be re-written in terms of 2-point
correlation functions of the conformal operators  as
S[g^>,f^>]= 1(2i)^2 dZ  
dZ   _S^+_d 
[g^>_()]^* _S^-_d f^>_<0 _out  O ^>_d-  ()
_in  O ^>_(  
A similar expression exists for the matrix element .
This formula relates the matrix elements of the S-matrix with the
light-cone conformal correlation functions of operators living on
the asymptotic d-spheres. A generalization of this formula to
many-particle amplitudes is straightforward. Our analysis suggests
that the S-matrix approach to Quantum Field Theory in Minkowski
space can be re-formulated entirely in terms of the correlation
functions of conformal operators living on the boundaries of the
light-cone. This opens the possibility to find a truly holographic
representation of the physics in Minkowski space. For such a
holographic representation we should also consider, obviously,
gravity in Minkowski space, to which we turn next.


Asymptotic light-cone structure and 

conformal  symmetry 



In this section we consider a more general class of metrics which
are not globally Minkowski but approach flat space in a suitable
asymptotic sense. In particular, we are interested in the
asymptotic light-cone structure of the metric and the asymptotic
symmetries associated to this structure.

First, we generalize the Minkowski metric studied in the previous
sections. It should approach the Minkowski metric asymptotically
in such a way that at infinity a slicing with constant curvature
surfaces is appropriate. For concreteness we consider only the
region .  We start with the following asymptotic form
of the (d+2)-metric
ds^2=-dt^2+t^2(d^24^2 (1+t^-1 (t,,))+
1 g_ij (t, ,)d^id^j+2t^-1 A_i(t,, )
d^i d)
6.1 
where normal coordinates, in which the components  and
 vanish, have been used. The metric in parenthesis in
() is the -metric on an Euclidean slice of
constant . Provided that the -metric is Ricci flat, the
 slice of the light-cone metric () should
for large  approach a solution of the Einstein equations with
negative cosmological constant. Therefore, the choice of the
metric () to the leading order in  is motivated by the
general form of the negative constant curvature metric studied in
the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The conformal
boundary of a  slice is at . For large  
each function in () is assumed to have an expansion in powers of 
as well as in powers of . For instance, the metric
 can be expanded as




which could also include logarithmic terms of the form 
 and each term in the -expansion should be also
expanded in terms of , e.g.




where  is to be interpreted as the metric
on the boundary  of the past light-cone. 
This boundary metric should be the same for all  slices. 
Expanding first in powers of  this  condition says that the 
constant term in the expansion should not be a function of ,
i.e. .
For large  this gives a restriction on the coefficients 
, namely only the one with  should be non-vanishing.
We do the holography along the -direction so that no additional 
expansion in -variable should not be necessary. It is however technically
more convenient to work with functions which have certain expansion in 
powers of .
A bonus we get is extra diffeomorphisms which generate transformations
in the  directions  and change the metric to  order.
The BMS group will be a part of these diffeomorphisms.

When we analyze the bulk diffeomorphisms that preserve the
asymptotic form  () we find that there is a particular
-independent diffeomorphism generated by
^t=0  ,   ^()  ,   ^k=^k(, )  ,
diff 
where  is some arbitrary function of ,
 has to satisfy
_^k=-14 g^ki _(0) _i ()  .
diff1 
The action of this diffeomorphism on  ,
 and  is then
given  by
L _()_-2^2A_k g^ki _(0) _i+^i_isigma 
L _g_ij =()(_g_ij -g_ij )
+^2t (A_i_j+A_j_i)+^(g) _i_j+
^(g) _j_i
gij 
L _A_i=()(_A_i +A_i)+
t4 (_iki g^kj _(0) _j)+^k_k A_i+
_i^k A_k
Ai 
Notice that although there appears to be a term (the one
proportional to ) in the right hand side of () which
destroys its asymptotic behavior, this is not really true
because 
vanishes as  in the limit where . One can
see from () that the diffeomorphism generated by
() acts on the metric  in
the same way as the diffeomorphism that was found into generate the asymptotic conformal structure of asymptotically
Anti-de Sitter space. In particular, it acts on the metric
, the metric on the asymptotic boundary
 of the light-cone,
 as a conformal transformation
L _g^(0,0) _ij =-()g^(0,0) _ij   .
conf 
Thus, our analysis demonstrates that the conformal structure
present on each AdS slice extends to the conformal structure
associated with the boundary of the light-cone of
-dimensional asymptotically Minkowski space-time.

The analysis done so far was restricted to the region 
. A similar analysis can be done in the regions 
and . In fact the conformal structure near the boundary
 of the past light-cone is analytic across the
light-cone and extends from region  to region 
. This can be seen by introducing new light-cone coordinates
,  so that
uv=-t^2  ,   vu =-  .
6.4 
In terms of these coordinates the past light-cone is defined  by
. The boundary  of the light-cone is now at
. In terms of the new coordinates the metric
() takes the light-cone form (for simplicity we discard
the subleading -terms in  the metric ())
ds^2=dudv+u^2 g^(0) _ij (,v/u)d^id^j  .
6.5 
The boundary of the light-cone is at , and the
-expansion of the metric components now becomes an expansion
in  . In the light-cone form () the metric is
analytic across the past light-cone (at ) and extends from
 to  everywhere in the neighborhood of the
boundary of the past-light cone.

The diffeomorphism () now takes the form
^v=12 v()  ,   ^u=-12 u()  ,   ^i=^i (u,v,)  .
6.11 
The form of the functions  is constrained by
the equations
_u^i=-v4u^2 g^ik _(0) (,v/u)_k  ,  
_v^i=14u g^ik _(0) (,v/u)_k   .
diffeo 
Since these are two equations there exists a consistency condition
. It reduces
to a condition  which
does hold since the metric components in () are functions
of . One can see from () that  is a
function of the ratio  of the light-cone coordinates. The
first term  in the expansion of 
near the boundary of the light-cone is proportional to  and
solving () to this order we find that
.

The components  transform under these
diffeomorphisms according to
L _g^(0) _ij =()(v_v g^(0) _ij -u^-1 
_u(u^2g^(0) _ij ))+^(0) _i_j+^(0) _j_i  .
mtransf 
Of course, equations (), () and
() are just the light-cone form of the previous
equations (), () and () that were
written in terms of the coordinates . However, the
analyticity of the conformal structure across the light-cone is
not obvious in those coordinates.

We conclude that there indeed exists a conformal symmetry
associated with the boundary of the light-cone in the metric
() or (). This symmetry is generated by a
certain bulk diffeomorphism (), () and can
be viewed as an extension of the conformal group existing on each
EAdS slice to a symmetry of the bulk.


BMS 

It should be noted that the group of all diffeomorphisms
preserving the structure of the metric () is larger than
just () and includes also -dependent diffeomorphisms.
The  full analysis of diffeomorphisms of this type is given in
Appendix C. We also find the generators of the well-known BMS
group as a particular case of these -dependent asymptotic
transformations. The vector generating these diffeomorphisms is
^t=f()^1/2    , 

^2t f() ^3/2   , 

^i=1t ^3/2  g_(0,0) ^ij ()_j f()  .
The BMS group  acts at a subleading order in the  expansion
and leaves the metric  on 
unchanged. The BMS transformations are the asymptotic symmetries
of the class of metrics which approach Minkowski metric near null
infinity. Our asymptotic condition () is less restrictive
and requires only that there is a light-cone structure near the
surface , which can be viewed as a single point in the
null infinity. Therefore the group of asymptotic symmetries in our
case is much larger than just BMS and in fact contains it as a
subgroup. Of course, one may wonder whether the group of
asymptotic symmetries and in particular the BMS group is actually
a symmetry of the dual theory. To analyze this issue we now turn
to a study of the various symmetries of the system.

Symmetries of the dual theory 

First we recall that a solution of the field equations of a
massless scalar field admits on the de Sitter slices near
 a decomposition given in ()
_+ (r,,)=12i _d2 -i ^d2 +i  dN_ ^-1  r^-  ( e^-    _out  O ^<_() + i^e^-(d-)   _out  O ^>_()
). We have been applying holography in the -direction,
resulting in the infinite set of operators 
 and 
. Instead of working with an infinite set of operators
parametrized by the continuous parameter , we could also
have decided replace the continuous parameter by an extra
coordinate, so that the dual theory seems to live in 
dimensions. One way to introduce such an extra coordinate is to
define
^< (,) =12i _d2 -i ^d2 +i  dN_ ^-1 
^-  _out  O ^<_() .
and similarly
^> (,) =12i _d2 -i ^d2 +i  dN_ ^-1 
^-  i^_out  O ^>_() .
In other words, the new coordinate  arises by doing an
inverse Mellin transform over the parameter . In
constructing  we essentially did nothing
but drop the leading exponential behavior in  in
(). Thus  describe the boundary
behavior of  as  and in that sense
it is similar to how one defines dual fields in AdS.

We have on purpose called the extra coordinate . It clearly
is very similar to , but to make clear that we really want to
view it as a new coordinate we gave it a new name. It is actually
also closely related to  that appears in ().
Indeed, , and
therefore  describes the field  as a
function of  if we identify  with . From this
perspective it is also tempting to view the fields
 as fields living on null infinity, and to
view  as the affine null coordinate of null infinity, so that
the dual theory would actually live on null infinity. As we will
see, this interpretation is somewhat problematic, but it would be
interesting to study this further.
On the other hand, 
 and dropping the overal factor
 the operator  can be considered as function
of . Since  is the affine coordinate along the light-cone
this suggests yet another intepretation of  and of the dual theory. 


We will now first study the action of the conformal group, or
equivalently, the Lorentz group . To write the explicit
form of these generators in the de Sitter coordinates
 it is convenient to combine the angles 
and  in a  component vector with components , so that
, and so that the angles parametrize the unit
sphere at . With this convention, the rotation and boost
generators of Minkowski space are
 
In order to determine the action of these generators on
, the strategy is to first find the exact
solution of the free field equation with asymptotic behavior
determined by , e.g. using a bulk-boundary
propagator, to act with the bulk generators () on the
exact solutions and to extract the new asymptotic behavior
. Luckily for the generators
() we can work with the asymptotic behavior only and we
find that
 
where as we did above we combined the angles and  into a
 component vector  with , and
 describes the action of the boost generators on
, and similarly for  and .

The form of the generators () is consistent with the fact
that the operators  are conformal
operators with conformal weights  or . It is
interesting to observe that the generators () are simple
differential operators when acting on .
Therefore, they give rise to Ward identities for correlation
functions in the dual theory. For example, a two point function of
the form
 ^<(_1,_1)  ^<(_2,_2)
should be annihilated by . In conformal
field theory the conformal Ward identities fix the form of a
two-point function up to normalization, but here it only fixes it
up to one unknown function. Indeed, one can show that the Ward
identities imply that (), up to contact terms, is of the
form
 ^<(_1,_1)  ^<(_2,_2)
= f(_1 _2 - _i ^i_1 ^i_2) f(_1
_2 (1-(_1,_2))) with some unknown function . In terms of the operators 
 the corresponding statement is that the
two-point function is proportional to
, but with a -dependent
normalization, so that also in that formulation there is a
function of one variable undetermined.

Similarly, one finds that (again up to contact terms)
 ^<(_1,_1)  ^>(_2,_2)
= _2^-d  f(_1 ^-1 _2 (1-(_1,_2))) . To determine the form of the function  one needs further input.
A typical form of a two-point function is obtained by for example
taking the first term proportional to  in (),
and by dropping the  that appears there.
The integral over  can be done explicitly, using the fact
that the inverse Mellin transform of  is
. This results
O ^<(_1,_1) O ^>(_2,_2)
= _2^-d  ( 1 + _1 2_2  (1-(_1,_2)))^-d/2 
which is very similar to the asymptotic form of the Feynman
propagator in coordinate space as .

The Lorentz or conformal generators () took  a very
simple form () when expressed in the new coordinate
. A crucial ingredient in the derivation of () was
the fact that we were considering a massless scalar field. In
general we would expect the conformal multiplet and the action of
the conformal generators to depend on the field under
consideration. For example, we can consider a massive scalar field
with its decomposition given in terms of MacDonald functions in
(). Unfortunately, there does not seem to be a simple
first order differential operator with eigenvalue  when
acting on . Therefore, the massive generalization
of () will be very complicated. The mode functions
 in () are still solutions of the massive
field equations on the AdS/dS slices, and the conformal group
still acts in a simple way on these modes. We therefore believe
that ultimately the description in terms of an infinite number of
conformal fields is more useful than the description in terms of
the additional coordinate .

Besides Lorentz invariance, the bulk theory is also
translationally invariant. Since our construction relies on a
choice of light-cone, which is not invariant under translations,
we may expect that translational invariance is not very manifest
in our framework. Perhaps this is what is to be expected for a
holographic dual description of Minkowski space, which is
inherently non-local and employs one dimension less.

The explicit form of the translation generators, written in the
same coordinates as used in (), reads
 
Consider now the first term in (), i.e. the one involving
. Acting with  on this we obtain
12i _d2 -i ^d2 +i 
dN_ ^-1  (-) r^-e^-(+1)    _out  O ^<_()
.
If we would drop the  exponentials, we would
from this deduce that
P^0 ^<(,) =   
^<(,) .
However, this answer cannot be correct. For example, any two-point
function of the form () cannot be annihilated by
 unless it vanishes identically. The mistake we made
is to work only with the asymptotic form of the fields, neglecting
subleading pieces that are necessarily there in the exact solution
to the field equation. Subleading terms can mix with the result in
(), and this changes the action of . We have not
worked out the full detailed form of  and , but a useful
perspective on these operators is obtained by looking at plane
waves in the decomposition given in () and in
particular in (). Given a plane wave with momentum ,
we denote the associated -dependent fields by
. One can work out the explicit form of
these fields. One finds that  is some function
of  times , where as before
 indicates the point on the -sphere given by the
 dimensional unit vector  (recall that we are still
discussing massless scalar fields here). On the other hand, we
have that
W^<_k(,) = (i 2 (k_0 - _i k_i
_i))  .
This shows that  cannot be equal to .
A plane wave has  eigenvalue , whereas
 acting on () has eigenvalue
   W^<_k(,) = i 2 
(k_0 - _i k_i _i) .
There is no simple operator for which () has eigenvalue
. Therefore, the easiest way to study translation invariance
would be to rewrite the fields  in terms of
momentum eigenstates such as (), in terms of which
translation invariance simply boils down to momentum conservation.
Incidentally, the fields () are, up to a factor of two,
simply the restriction of a plane wave to the light-cone. This
suggest yet another interpretation for , namely as a null
coordinate along the light-cone. Since all AdS and dS slices
asymptote to the light cone, this is perhaps the most natural
interpretation of .

Besides translations, there are infinitely many other operators in
the BMS group which are probably also very complicated; naively
they seem to act on fields  as
, but as the example of 
demonstrated, this is not quite correct. In addition the BMS
generators are not exact symmetries of Minkowski space, and we
therefore do not expect them to annihilate the vacuum state of the
dual theory, and for the same reason we also do not expect them to
give rise to new Ward identities. At best they provide a set of
spectrum generating operators, but more work is needed to verify
whether this is indeed the case or not. Actually, this applies to
all asymptotic symmetries described in the beginning of this
section, not just to the BMS operators.




Gravitational holographic description 

In section 4 of this paper we have seen how for a scalar field in
Minkowski space a dual description emerges by first reducing the
scalar field to a set of massive fields on a the constant
curvature (de Sitter or anti-de Sitter) slices of space-time. In
this section we will attempt to make a first step towards
generalizing this duality to the gravitational field. The field
equations in this case are the usual non-linear Einstein equations
(with vanishing cosmological constant)
R _ =0  ,
7.1 
which define a Ricci-flat space-time, which appears to be the
appropriate generalization of flat Minkowski space. Equation
() should be solved subject to suitable boundary
conditions for the metric. We choose so-called normal coordinates
in which the metric has the form
ds^2=dr^2+r^2g_ij (x,r) dx^idx^j  .
7.2 
Notice that for concreteness we consider the region analogous to
the region  of Minkowski space, where the coordinate 
plays the role of a radial coordinate and the metric 
is assumed to have an asymptotic expansion in powers of . The
coordinates  are the coordinates on the
slices, in the previous section  we had .

The bulk diffeomorphisms preserving the form () are
generated by a vector field  such that
&&^r=(x) ,  ^i=^i(x,r) 

&&_r^i=-1r^2 g^ij (x,r)_j(x)  .
df 
The metric components change according to
L _g_ij (x,r)=(x)r^-2 _r(r^2g_ij )+^(g) _i_j+
^(g) _j_i   .
df1 




The first term   in the expansion of
 is the metric on the asymptotic space-like boundary
of space-time. In analogy with the AdS/CFT correspondence one
could try to keep the metric  fixed and one could
try to solve the bulk Einstein equations subject to this Dirichlet
condition. However, in the present case when the bulk metric is
determined by equation () the metric  is
not arbitrary but has to satisfy (see,,
)
R_ij [g^(0) ]=d  g^(0) _ij   .
7.3 
This means that the boundary at space-like infinity is described
by an Einstein metric of constant positive curvature.

Provided that a metric  satisfying () is
fixed one can try to develop the  expansion of the metric
() and determine the other terms in the expansion of
. To some extent this was analyzed in
 and it was found that the relation between
the coefficients in the expansion of  is differential. 
This is different from what happens in asymptotically
Anti-de Sitter space, where the relations are algebraic. This
makes it difficult to solve the recurrence relations and to
determine the coefficients in the series provided the first
coefficient  is given.

However, the holographic point of view we are trying to develop in
this paper is not based on fixing boundary data at spatial
infinity. It is based on fixing an infinite set of data near the
boundaries of the light-cone, and the holographic reduction takes
place along the anti-de Sitter slices, and not along the
coordinate . Thus, what we should really try to is to take the
metric in the form (), and to study the field equations
for this metric in this form. Ideally, there should exist some
separation of variables that allows us to separate the
-dependence from the dependence on the other coordinates, just
as we did for the massless scalar field. In view of the
non-linearity of the Einstein equations it is not clear exactly
how we should separate the -dependence, but assuming we have
achieved this the -dependence will be gone and it will be
replaced by a dependence on some spectral parameter . The
boundary data will then involve quantities such as
,  and
. The holographic reconstruction of the
metric now requires us to determine the -dependence, and
those equations are indeed algebraic. We leave a more detailed
study of these issues to future work and limit ourselves here to
the discussion of one example, namely the relatively simple case
of -dimensional Minkowski space.


Example: (2+1)-dimensional Minkowski space-time 


In three space-time dimensions the Riemann tensor is algebraically
related to the Ricci tensor. This property was used into find a general solution to the three-dimensional Einstein
equations with a negative cosmological constant.

In the case at hand, the fact that the Ricci tensor vanishes
implies that the Riemann tensor vanishes as well,
R _ =0  ,
7.4 
i.e. space-time is locally flat which is of course a well-known
fact in three dimensions. This is a great simplification in
solving () and in fact allows us to find an exact
solution in a way similar to the analysis given in.

By introducing the variable  the
equation () for the metric () reduces to the
following set of equations
12 -1 7.5 
R_likj []=14 ij lk -14 ik 
lj   ,
7.6 
_k^() ij -_j^() ik =0  ,
7.7 
where we denote .
Differentiating equation () once again with respect to 
we find that



Hence  is a quadratic function of , i.e.
(x,r)=r^2g_(0) +rg_(1) +g_(2)   .
7.8 
Inserting this back into equation () we find that
g_(2) =14 g_(1) g^-1 _(0) g_(1) 
7.9 
so that () can be written as a total square




Next, to solve equation () we use the following identity,
valid in two dimensions, that relates the Riemann tensor to the
Ricci scalar,




Inserting () into eq.(), expanding in powers of 
and using the above identity we find  in the leading order
that
R[g_(0) ]=2  ,
7.10 
i.e. the space at infinity is two-dimensional de Sitter space.
This is a particular manifestation of the general behavior
() of the asymptotically flat metric. At the next order
in  equation () reduces to a single
equation(Hereafter we use  to define the trace,
e.g. .) 
^i_(0) ^j_(0) g_(1)ij -^2_(0)  g_(1) =0  .
7.11 
On the other hand, equation () is trivially satisfied to
the leading order and in the next order gives rise to the equation
^k_(0) g_(1)ki =_i g_(1)   .
7.12 
We see that () is  a  consequence of ().
The equations () and () are the only
constraints to be imposed on the terms in the expansion ().

Notice that equation () means that the tensor
, like a stress-energy tensor, is
covariantly conserved with respect to the metric . 
In fact, according to the prescription of Brown
and York the quasi-local stress-energy tensor of
a spacetime is defined on the boundary (placed at a fixed value of
 which then should be taken to infinity) as a variation of the
gravitational action with respect to the boundary metric and takes
the form
T^bound _ij []&=&-18G (K_ij -K_ij ) 

&=&-18G (-2r g_ij +
r^2(_r g_ij -g_ij (g^-1 _r g))  .
7.13 
This expression is divergent when  is taken to infinity. This
can be thought of as a UV divergence in the theory on de Sitter space. It
can be regularized by adding a local counterterm
T^ct _ij []=14G 1r  _ij   .
7.14 
The total stress tensor defined as the sum of the two
contributions,
T_ij []&=&T^bound _ij +T^ct _ij  

&=& -18G (g_(1)ij -g_(0)ij  g_(1) )
7.15 
then has a finite limit when  is taken to infinity and this
limit reproduces the expression in the second line of
(). We see that up to a factor the stress tensor
 is exactly the tensor which enters () and thus
should be covariantly conserved with respect to the metric
,
^j_(0) T_ij =0  .
T 
In the remainder of the discussion we will use units in which
.

Although empty -space-time is locally flat it becomes
curved in the presence of matter. For instance, a point particle
creates -like conical singularity distributed along the
particle world line. The stress-energy tensor () then
determines the energy and angular momentum of the matter as
measured at space-like infinity. In terms of  we have that
g^(1) _ij =-T_ij +g^(0) _ij T  .
g1 
Taking into account () and () we see that the
boundary stress tensor  and the boundary metric
 subject to constraint () completely
determine the bulk metric satisfying the Ricci-flat equation
() in three dimensions. This is  similar to what we had
in the case of negative cosmological constant in three dimensions
. The difference is that in the latter case the trace of
the boundary stress tensor is fixed and no constraint on the
boundary metric arises. The stress tensor on the de Sitter
boundary of asymptotically Minkowski space-time  should be
covariantly conserved with respect to the metric 
but is otherwise arbitrary. In particular, there is no restriction
on the trace of . This would be quite natural if we were
doing a holographic reduction in the radial direction, since then
 should represent a stress tensor of a boundary theory
which is holographically dual to a theory in the bulk. But we
emphasize once more that this not the type of holographic
reduction we are attempting to do in this paper.

To the leading order the -dependent diffeomorphism ()
is generated by the vector field
^r=(x)  ,   ^i=1r g^ij _(0) _j(x)  ,
xir 
where  is arbitrary function on the de Sitter boundary.
The boundary metric  remains unchanged under this transformation while
 transforms  as
L _g^(1) _ij =(x) g^(0) _ij +^(0) _i
^(0) _j  .
7.16 
This transformation
acts as
_T_ij =-^(0) _i
^(0) _j+g^(0) _ij _(0) ^2+g^(0) _ij 
7.17 
on the stress tensor . It is easy to check that the r.h.s.
in () is covariantly conserved on a two-dimensional
space-time of constant curvature (). It can be obtained
by varying the following "dilaton-gravity" boundary action
W_ =d^2xg_(0)   (x)  ( R[g_(0) ]-2)  
7.18 
with respect to the metric. Note also that the variation of
() with respect to  gives rise to the
equation ().

Let us now show that on de Sitter space the stress tensor 
can be  determined by solving () provided its trace is some
known function
T=C(x)  .
trT 
We choose the metric
ds^2=1z^2 (-dz^2+d^2)=4(x_+-x_-)^2 dx_+dx_-  ,
dS 
where , ,  to describe the
two-dimensional de Sitter space. This coordinate system covers
half of de Sitter space, the boundary then being at . The
trace equation () then determines the  component of
the stress tensor
T_+- =1(x_+-x_-)^2 C(x_+,x_-)  .
7.19 
From () we obtain a couple of differential equations
_-T_++ =-1(x_+-x_-)^2 _+C  ,  
_+T_- =-1(x_+-x_-)^2 _+C  .
7.20 
A solution can be  easily found  and it takes the form
T_++ (x_+,x_-)=f(x_+)-^x_- dv(x_+-v)^2 _+ C(x_+,v)


T_- (x_+,x_-)=h(x_-)-^x_+ du(x_-u)^2 _- C(u,x_-)  ,
7.21 
where  and  are arbitrary functions of  and
 respectively. The boundary stress tensor (),
() and eventually the bulk metric are determined by
specifying the  functions ,  and . Let
us now return to the holographic interpretation of this solution.
The central idea proposed in this paper is to reduce everything to
holographic data on the boundary of the light-cone, which in the
present case is a circle located at  and parametrized by the
angle coordinate . Thus, from the point of view of the
holographic reconstruction it is important to see what the minimal
data is that we need to fix on this circle in order to reconstruct
the full -dimensional spacetime. We see that the values of
the functions  and  at late times  are
completely determined by their values at , i.e. 
and . On the other hand, the function 
seems to require an infinite set of functions to be specified at
, namely all coefficients in the expansion
C(x_+,x_-)=_n=0 ^C_n() z^n  ,
Cn 
where  and .
However, most of this infinite set of functions can be gauged away
by the coordinate transformation (). As is seen from
() this transformation parametrised by



transforms the function . Specifically, the coefficients in the expansion
() transform as follows
_C_n()=
14 n-2 ()-(n-2)(n+1)_n()  .
dCn 
We see that the parameter function  contains
enough freedom to eliminate almost all functions 
with one exception: the same parameter  is used
to transform both  and  so that one can
not eliminate both. In fact the combination



is invariant under the transformation, 
. Thus, the functions  together with
 and  form the only independent and
"gauge-invariant" set of data which should be specified at the
boundary of the light-cone. These data are sufficient to
holographically reconstruct the whole three-dimensional metric.
Actually, this is a quite subtle statement. Asymptotic
diffeomorphisms do not in general extend to smooth diffeomorphisms
of the entire space, and acting with them typically generates
singularities. The diffeomorphisms used to reduce the infinite set
of functions  to just one function of  are
presumably of this form. Therefore, if we are interested in smooth
solutions, it is probably better to work with the infinite set
 instead. For this infinite set the existence of a
globally smooth solution is obviously also not guaranteed, and
more work is required to determine which sets of 
correspond to smooth solutions.

We finish this section with a comment on a RG interpretation of
the -dimensional metric. As we have seen above, if we view
 as the direction in which we do the holographic reduction the
standard interpretation of the radial position  of the boundary
is as a UV cut-off in the boundary theory. The dependence of the
metric on  can be viewed as some kind of RG-flow. In this
respect it is interesting to see whether this flow is irreversible
so that some kind of analog of the C-theorem could be found.
Remarkably the flow, as it is dictated by the bulk Einstein
equation (), is indeed irreversible. In order to see
this, we consider the quasi-local stress tensor () and
examine how its trace computed with respect to the induced metric
 changes as a function of . Using equation
() we find that
_r T^bound =-12 (^-1 -1 7.22 
However, it is not clear whether the bulk gravitational dynamics
drives the flow to a fixed point which would correspond to a
conformal field theory on de Sitter boundary of Minkowski space.
In any case this is not the point of view we want to pursue
further.

Conclusion 
























. There, it was proposed that the
dual CFT has non-standard hermiticity conditions, such that
complex conformal weights do not violate unitarity, and
 is unitarily realized. In fact, there are two CFT's,
one living on each boundary, and full correlation functions are
given by evaluating them in the product theory in a suitable
entangled state. This entangled state is the analogue of the
S-matrix, and the set of correlation functions on each of the
spheres at infinity represents the in and out Hilbert spaces.

Clearly, it should also be possible to study other manifolds that
can be sliced in (anti)-de Sitter slices, and to study holography
in those cases. It would also be interesting to study e.g. anti-de
Sitter space in the Poincare patch, to view this as a slicing with
Minkowski slices and to see if the known holography for anti-de
Sitter space is consistent with our proposed Minkowski space
holography.

A further extension and a crucial test of our idea would be to
study the Schwarzschild metric, and to see how the entropy of the
Schwarzschild black hole is reflected in the dual CFT. For this,
we should first further develop the extension of our method to the
gravitational field, for which only a few first steps were made in
sections 6,7. Especially, it is not yet clear exactly which data
at infinity we should specify in order to reconstruct the bulk
geometry, and whether this data allows for an interpretation in
terms of an infinite set of stress-energy tensors.

One can imagine many other extensions. We have only briefly
considered massive scalar fields, and it would be desirably to
understand these better. Another thing that comes to mind is a
supersymmetric generalization (or a generalization to string
theory). Since supersymmetries close into translation generators
and we already saw that translation symmetry does not take on a
very simply form, we suspect that it will also be difficult to
keep supersymmetry manifest in the formulation. The fact that
translation invariance is implemented in such a cumbersome way is
perhaps to be expected for a holographic dual description of
Minkowski space, but it would be nice to have a clearer
understanding of this point.

Even though free massive particles will not approach the boundary
of the light-cone, but rather go to timelike infinity, we still
saw that it is possible to describe them in terms of data on the
boundary of the light cone. The situation gets even more confusing
for strongly interacting degrees of freedom, such as those that
appear in confining gauge theories, and for which the LSZ
formalism does not seem appropriate. We nevertheless still expect
that the physics of such degrees of freedom will be captured by
suitable data on the two spheres that form the boundary of the
light-cone.

Of course, we are not living in Minkowski space, and it is an even
more urgent question to find a holographic dual description of a
realistic time-dependent cosmological solution. Nevertheless,
Minkowski space is still a good approximation for many physical
questions, and understanding Minkowski space is definitely a step
in the right direction. Incidentally, four-dimensional Minkowski
space reduces in this philosophy to a theory on two two-spheres,
which have an infinite dimensional conformal symmetry, and this
may lead to an interesting role of the Virasoro algebra for
four-dimensional physics.

Kernels and delta-functions 
The kernel



produces a delta-function concentrated at  when
. In order to see this and get the precise
factor we take  and approximate 
. In the limit of large 
the kernel takes the form



By introducing the small parameter  this can be
brought in the form




where the term in the parenthesis generates the delta-function
 on d-sphere up to some
normalization constant. In order to determine this constant we
consider the integral





where the first factor is the area of  a (d-1)-sphere and in the
integration over the azimuthal angle we changed the variable
 to . The -integration results in



Putting things together we find that
_y (y-y(,- =
(2)^d2 2^d2 (d2 )()  e^-(d-)y ^(d) (,A1 
A similar analysis can be done for the kernels



in the limits  or 
. The integration over the azimuthal angle in this case is





where we first deformed the integration contour to the positive
imaginary axis (the possible integral over the quarter-circle at
infinity vanishes provided  is slightly positive)
and then changed variables  that brings us back
to the already known integral given above. Thus, we find that
&&_+ 
(-(,- 

&&=(2)^d/2  2^d2   i^(d-2)  (d2 )()  e^-(d-) ^(d) (,  .

&&=(2)^d/2  2^d2   (i)^d  (d2 )()  e^(d-) ^(d) (,A3 
is concentrated at the anti-podal points on the d-sphere.


Plane wave normalization 
The plane waves
f_k(X_0,X  )=1[(2)^d+1 2k]^1/2  e^-i(kX_0-k X ) 
B1 
are delta-function normalized
(f_k,f_p)=^(d+1) (k  ,p  )=k^-d 
(k-p)^(d) (_k,_p)
B2 
with respect to the standard Klein-Gordon scalar product whic is
defined as
(f_k,f_p)=i_d(f^*_k_n f_p-_n f^*_k f_p)
B3 
provided the hypersurface  (with the normal vector )
is a surface of constant Minkowski time .

However, for our purposes we would like to choose a hypersurface
associated with the boundary of the light-cone. More specifically
we define  as a hypersurface  consisting of two
components: a surface  in the region  and a
surface  () in the region . The
hypersurface  thus surrounds the boundary
 of the light-cone. Similarly we define 

near the boundary .

Here we show that same normalization () still holds if we
choose  (or ) in the scalar
product (). We demonstrate this explicitly for the surface
. The non-vanishing components of the normal
vector  are  (in region ) and
 (in region ). Hence each component gives

plane wave asymptotically behaves as
e^i(kX_0-k X ) =2^d^d2 2i d (i)^(d2 ) k^-  t^- 
e^-(d-)y  
^(d) (,_k)  ,
B5 
where we again assumed that  is slightly
positive which allows us to drop the term proportional to

for the scalar product over . Notice that the
powers of  coming from the contributions of each component
nicely combine into
.
Using that the Gamma function satisfies




the -integration in () reduces to a simple
integral



Thus, equation () is indeed identical to
().

Note that this result could have been anticipated. Indeed, suppose
that we add to the hypersurface  the surface
 in the region . The resulting hypersurface can
be thought of as a deformation of the surface  for
which the standard normalization () holds. Now, the
Klein-Gordon scalar product () should not change under any
deformation of the surface . On the other hand, the
contribution of the surface  to the scalar product
vanishes provided  is small but positive. Hence,
the whole contribution to the scalar product should come entirely
from the hypersurface . We however found it
useful to give an explicit calculation of the scalar product over
. This serves both as an illustration of our
techniques as well as a consistency check.


Diffeomorphisms 
  Here we perform analysis
of the diffeomorphisms preserving the asymptotic structure of the
metric (). Suppose that the diffeomorphism is generated
by a vector field . By requiring
that  we obtain  from
which we find that the -component of the vector  does not
depend on  so that
^t=(, )  ,
a1 
where  is arbitrary function of  and .

The condition  leads to
_t ^4^2(1+1t ) 
(t^-2 _-1 A_i_t^i)  .
a2 
and from the condition 
we find that
_t^i=(t^-2 g^ji _i-1 g^ji A_i_t^)  .
a3 
Multiplying equation () by  and inserting the result
into equation () we find the equations for the
-derivatives of  and :
_t ^1(1+1t 4^3t^2 A^2) 4^2t^2 
(_t A^i_i)  .
a4 
_t^i=
t^2 g^ji _i-4^3t^3 
g^ji A_i(1+1t 4^3t^2 A^2) 
(_t A^i_i)  ,
a5 
where we introduced  and all -indexes are
raised with help of the metric .

Now, let us make a substitution
&&^(, )+1t (t,, ) 

&&^i=^i_(0) (, )+1t ^i_(1) (, )+..
a6 
The  term in the  component of the metric is
fixed and should not be changed under the diffeomorphism. This
implies 
 which in turn leads to
(, )=()  ,
a7 
where  is an arbitrary function. Similarly, the
 term in  of the metric () vanishes.  In
order to preserve this condition the -independent part of
 should satisfy
^j_(0) =-14 g^ji _(0) _j()  .
a8 
The diffeomorphism generated by the vector field


is the only -independent diffeomorphism that preserves the form
().

As for the -dependent parts of the functions, 
 plays the role of the parameters of the transformation.
Equations () and () determine 
 and  in terms of 
. For the first terms in the -expansion of these
functions we find that
&&_(0) (,)=-4^2_(, ) ,   

&&_(1) =2^2(_(0) _+A^i_(0) _i)
a9 
and
^i_(1) =g^ij _(0) _j(, )  .
a10 
The subleading terms in  and  change
under the diffeomorphisms and will give us the transformation law
for the functions  and 
but we will not give the explicit form here. Also, by acting on
the  part of the metric the diffeomorphism provides the
transformation law for , namely
&&L _g_ij =(,) (_t+2t g_ij )+^(_g_ij -1 g_ij )

&&+t (A_i_j^+A_j_i^) +^(g) _i_j+

where  takes the form (). The transformations
generated by the -independent part of the diffeomorphisms are
given in (), () and () in the main
text.

It is interesting to note that the BMS transformation are a
particular case of the -dependent diffeomorphisms.
Specifically, they are determined by the function 
 where  is an
arbitrary function of the angle coordinate  on the boundary
 of the light-cone. The vector generating these
diffeomorphisms is
^t=f()^1/2    , 

^2t f() ^3/2   , 

^i=1t ^3/2  g_(0) ^ij _j f()  .
The BMS transformations are known to be the transformations at null infinity
of asymptotically Minkowski spacetime (with a suitable definition
of the notion "asymptotically Minkowski.") It should be stressed
that our conditions for the asymptotic metric () are more
general than that of BMS and thus the asymptotic diffeomorphisms
contain the BMS group as a subgroup.
