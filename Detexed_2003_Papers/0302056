We review some recent results concerning the quantitative 
analysis of the universality classes of two-dimensional statistical 
models near their critical point. We also discuss the exact calculation 
of the two-point correlation functions of disorder operators in a free theory 
of complex bosonic and fermionic field, correlators ruled by a Painleve  
differential equation. 


Introduction 



One of the most important successes of Quantum Field Theory (QFT) 
in recent years is the quantitative analysis of the
universality classes of two-dimensional statistical mechanical 
models near their second order phase transition points. 
This has been possible, in particular, thanks to new developments 
in the methods of computing off-critical correlation functions. 
The aim of this talk is to review some of the recent results relative 
to these two important subjects. Our discussion is divided in two parts: 
in the first part, we shall see how correlation functions can be used to 
extract useful numbers (the so-called universal ratios ) that 
can be directly compared with experiments. In the second part, we 
shall concentrate on a particularly interesting class of models, those of 
fermionic and bosonic theories with a  symmetry, for which 
there is an elegant approach to derive differential equations 
satisfied by the two-point functions of their disorder 
operators. 

Universal Amplitude Ratios 


Consider a statistical model with  relevant fields 
 at criticality. Near the critical point, 
its action can be parameterised as 
A  = A _CFT  + g_i _i(x) d^Dx
, 

where  is the action which encodes the 
data of the Conformal Field Theory of the critical point. 
The short-distance behaviour of the two-point functions is given by 




for , where  is the conformal 
dimension of the operator . Hence, their conjugate 
coupling constants  
behave as


 where  is a mass scale. Away from criticality 
there will be generally a finite correlation length  which in the 
thermodynamical limit scales as



where  may be regarded as a microscopic
length scale. The dimensionless quantities  are non-universal 
metric factors specific of the system representing the universality class
and depending on the units chosen for measuring the external sources
. 
If there are several deformations of the conformal action, the most 
general expression for the scaling form of the correlation length 
may be written as
=_i a (K_i g_i)^
-1 D -2 _i  
L _i(K_j g_j (K_i g_i)^_ji   ) ,
where



are the so-called crossover exponents  whereas         
are universal homogeneous scaling functions of the ratios
. There are of course
several (but equivalent) ways of expressing these scaling forms,
depending on which coupling constant is selected as a prefactor.
In the limit where  () but
, equation () becomes
_i = a _i^0 g_i
^-1 D -2 _i  
,  
_i^0 K_i^-1 D -2 _i   .
Let us consider now the free-energy , 
a dimensionless quantity defined by
e^-f(g_1,,g_n)  = 
D  e^- [
A _CFT  +_i=1 ^n g_i _i(x) d^Dx
]  .
Under the hypothesis of hyperscaling, its singular part (per unit 
of volume)  is proportional, in the thermodynamical 
limit, to the -th power of the correlation length. Depending on the 
scaling form adopted for the correlation length, we have correspondingly
several (but equivalent) ways of parameterizing this quantity
f_i[g_1,,g_n] (K_i g_i)^D D-2_i   
F _i(K_j g_j (K_i g_i)^_ji   )
.
The functions  are universal homogeneous scaling
functions of the ratios .

From the above expression we can derive the expectation values of several 
quantities. We will use the notation  to denote 
expectation values computed in the off-critical theory obtained by 
keeping (at the end) only the coupling constant  different from zero.
Basic quantities are the vacuum expectation values (VEV) of the fields 
 which can be parameterized as
_j _i = -.f_i g_j 
_g_l=0  B_ji 
g_i^2 _j D-2 _i   ,
with
B_ji  K_j K_i^2 _j D-2 _i   .
The above relations can be equivalently expressed as
g_i = D_ij  (_j_i)^
D-2 _i 2 _j   ,
with
D_ij  1 K_i K_j^D-2 _i 2 _j   
.
The generalized susceptibilities of the model are defined by
_jk ^i =
 g_k  _j_i =.
-^2 f_i g_k g_j _g_l=0 
. They are obviously symmetrical in the two lower indices. By
extracting their dependence on the coupling constant ,
they can be expressed as
_jk ^i = _jk ^i g_i^
2 _j + 2 _k - D 
D - 2 _i    ,
with
_jk ^i K_j K_k K_i^2 _j + 2 _k - D 
D - 2 _i    .
The various quantities obtained by taking the derivatives of the 
free-energy obviously contain the quantities  which make their 
values not universal. However, it is easy and always possible to 
consider special combinations thereof in such a way to cancel out all 
metric factors. Universal Ratios usually considered in the literature 
are those given below 
(R_c)^i_jk  = _ii ^i _jk ^i B_ji  B_ki  
 ;
(R_ )^i_j = _jj ^i D_jj  B_ji ^
D-4 _j 2 _j  
;
R^i_  = (_ii ^i)^1/D  _i^0 ;
(R_A)^i_j = _jj ^i  D_ii ^
4 _j + 2 _i - 2 D D-2 _i   
B_ij ^2_j -D _i    ;
(Q_2)^i_jk  = ^i_jj  ^k_jj  
(_k^0 _j^0 )^D-4 _j  .
From their definition, these quantities are pure numbers attached 
to the universality classes and therefore they can be used to characterize 
them. Contrary to the critical exponents (which are characteristic of 
the critical point) they carry information about the scaling region .
Moreover, the amplitude ratios are numbers which typically present
significant variations between different classes of universality, 
whereas the critical exponents usually assume small values which 
only vary by a small percent when changing the universality class. 
Hence the universal ratios may be ideal marks of the 
critical scaling regime. It is also worth emphasizing 
that, from an experimental point of view, it should be simpler to 
measure universal amplitude ratios rather than critical exponents: 
to determine the former quantities one needs to perform 
several measurements at a single, fixed value of the coupling 
which drives the system away from criticality whereas to determine 
the latter, one needs to make measurements over several decades 
along the axes of the off-critical couplings. Moreover, 
although not all of them are independent, the universal ratios 
are a larger set of numbers than the critical exponents and 
therefore permit a more precise determination of the class of
universality.                                                               


Quantum Field Theory Approach 

It is interesting to see how in two dimensions Quantum Field Theory 
provides a powerful approach to compute the Universal Ratios of a 
given class of universality in a non-perturbative way. 
In the following we concentrate mostly 
our attention on the off-critical models obtained as deformations 
of the so-called Minimal Models  of two-dimensional Conformal 
Field Theory.

As we have seen before, each coupling constant  relative 
to the relevant operator  of the model under 
investigation is a dimensional quantity which can be related to 
the lowest mass-gap  of the off-critical theory 
according to the formula 
m_i = C _i g_i^1 2-2 _i    .  

When the QFT associated to the action () 
is integrable, the pure number  can be exactly 
determined by means of the Thermodynamical Bethe Ansatz 
. When the theory is not integrable, the constant 
 can be nevertheless determined by a numerical method, 
based on the so-called Truncated Conformal Space Approach 
. In conclusion, for all individual deformations of 
a given model, we are able to completely set the relationship which 
links the coupling constant to the mass-gap of the theory and 
therefore to switch freely between these two variables. 

Additional quantities which can be determined  by QFT are the matrix 
elements of the order parameters, the simplest ones being the vacuum 
expectation values (VEV). They are parameterised as 
_j _i = B_ji  g_i^_j 
1- _i   
.

When the theory is integrable, the constant  can 
be fixed exactly, thanks to the results of a remarkable series of 
papers. When it is not integrable, the 
constant  can be nevertheless estimated by means 
of a numerical approach, as firstly shown in. 
Hence, we are able to determine completely also these quantities. 
Moreover, as shown in, a generalization of the 
numerical approach of ref. often leads to a reasonable 
estimate of the matrix elements of the order parameters between 
the vacuum states and some of the excited states, as for instance 


 
where  is a one-particle state of mass . These 
quantities turn out to be useful for obtaining sensible
approximation of the large-distance behavior of several 
correlators. 

Another important and useful piece of information on the off-critical 
models can be obtained by exploiting the properties of the stress-energy 
tensor . In the presence of the perturbing field 
, the trace of the stress-energy tensor is 
given by 
(x) = 2 g_i (2 - 2 _i) _i .

It enters a useful sum rule, the so called -theorem 
 
_j = -1 4 _j _i  
 d^2x (x) _j(0) _i^c 
, 

which relates the conformal dimension  of the 
field  to its VEV and to the integral of its connected 
off-critical correlator with . It is easy to 
see that the above formula simply expresses the content of the 
fluctuation-dissipation theorem and when the above integral 
diverges, so does the VEV in the denominator, in such a way 
that eq.() always keeps its validity.  

As discussed above, basic quantities entering the universal 
ratios are the generalized susceptibilities . 
By using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, they are given 
by 
_jk ^i = d^2 x _j(x) 
_k(0)^c _i 
.

By extracting their dependence on the coupling constant , 
we have 
 
with 
_jk ^i = C _i^2 _j+2_k-2  
d1 ^2_j+2_k   Q_jk () 
.
Some of the above susceptibilities can be determined exactly, 
such as the components , whose values are 
provided by the -theorem sum rule 
_ik ^i = - _k 1-_k  B_ki  .

In all other cases, when an exact formula is not available, 
the strategy to evaluate the generalized susceptibilities  
relies on two different possible representations of the 
correlators. As we will see, these representations have 
the advantage of converging very rapidly in two distinct regions 
and to smoothly join in between. 

The first representation is based on Conformal Perturbation 
Theory (with the use of the non-analytic expression 
of the VEV). In this approach the two-point
correlators are expressed as 
_i(x) _j(0)= 
_p C_ij ^p(g;x) A_p(0)
where the structure functions 
 admit the 
expansion
C_ij ^p(g;x)= r^2(_p-_i-_j)  
_n=0 ^ C_i,j ^p(n) (gr^2-2_  )^n 
 ,
() and can be computed perturbatively in , the coupling
conjugated to the perturbing operator . 
For instance, the first order correction to the conformal structure 
constant  is determined byC_i,j ^p(1)  = -' d^2w A ^p() 
 (w) _i(1) _j(0)_CFT  
,
where the prime indicates a suitable infrared (large distance) 
regularization of the integral. This representation allows a 
very efficient estimate of the correlation function in its 
short distance regime . 

The second representation is based on the Form Factors (which 
will be discussed in more detail below) and allows an efficient 
control of the large distance behavior, i.e. when . 
In this second representation, one makes use of the knowledge 
of the off-critical mass spectrum of the theory to express the 
correlators 
as
_i(x) _j(0)= _n=0 ^  
g_i,j ^(n) (r) ,

where 
  
 are the 
multi-particle states relative to the excitations of mass 
, with relativistic dispersion relations given by 
, , where  
is the rapidity variable. The spectral representation 
() is an expansion in the parameter 
, where  is the lowest 
mass-gap. 

Basic quantities of the large distance approach are the Form Factors 
(FF), i.e.  the matrix elements of the operators  on the 
physical asymptotic states 
F^_i _a_1,,a_n (_1,,_n) =  0
_i(0)A_a_1 (_1)A_a_n  (_n) .
 



For scalar operators, relativistic invariance requires that the FF 
only depend on the rapidity differences . 
In integrable quantum field theories the FF are solutions of some 
functional equations which will be 
recalled in the next section.  It is worth to stress that for 
most of the operators, it is sufficient to insert into the 
spectral representations only their one-particle and two-particle 
FF in order to reach a very reasonable estimate of the correlators. 

In conclusion, both the expansions () and () 
converge very rapidly in their domain (see, for instance 
) and therefore it is possible 
to estimate the integral () by following this 
procedure: 
 
Express the integral in polar coordinates as 
_jk ^i = 2_0^+  
d r r _j(r) 
_k(0)_c^i  , 

and split the radial integral into two pieces as 
 

Use the best available short-distance representation of the 
correlator to evaluate  as well as the best available 
estimate of its large-distance representation to evaluate 
. 
Optimize the choice of the parameter  in such a 
way to obtain the best evaluation of the whole integral. 
In practice, this means looking at that value of  
for which a plateau is obtained for the sum of  
and . Said in another way,  belongs to that 
interval where there is an overlap between the short-distance 
and the long-distance expansion of the correlator. 

The above methods have been applied to compute universal 
ratios of several interesting universality classes, such as the 
one of the Ising model, the Tricritical Ising 
Model, the Self-Avoiding Walks, 
the -state Potts model and percolation, to quote 
few. These field theoretical results have been confirmed through direct 
lattice estimates (see Refs.).

Disorder Operator and Fermion-Boson Correspondence 

From the above discussion, we have seen that a great deal of 
information can be extracted for the scaling region of a model 
also in the absence of an exact expression of the correlation 
functions. It is however an important theoretical problem 
to see whether it is possible to obtain a closed and exact formula 
for these quantities. It goes without saying that, in general, 
this is quite a difficult problem, partially solved only for few 
models. In the second part of this talk, we shall discuss a 
particularly interesting example of such a computation, which leads 
to a differential equation ruling the correlators. Our presentation 
is based on the results presented in the paper. 

In order to start our discussion, let us consider the (euclidean) action
A =d^2x[_^*^+m^2^*+W(^*,)],
where the potential  is invariant under the  transformation
, . 
Let , , be the  vacuua of the 
broken phase of this theory, with , 
, the disorder operators which create the 
excitations (kink states) interpolating between the vacua 
 and . 
These operators carry  units of topological charge 
and 
satisfy the conjugation relation . The mutual 
non-locality between the order and disorder operators 
gives rise to a phase factor when they go  around each other in the 
euclidean plane (, ):
* 
These relations are valid along any -invariant renormalization 
group trajectory flowing out of the phase transition point and 
characterise the operators  beyond their initial role of 
kink creation operators in the broken phase. The theory () 
with  is a particularly simple example of such a trajectory 
for which, as we will see, the correlation functions of disorder 
operators remain non-trivial due to the non-locality with respect 
to the boson. 

The correlation functions of non-local operators in two-dimensional free 
massive theories were extensively studied from the point of view of the 
isomonodromy theory of differential equations in Ref. and a 
series of related papers. Several works (see for instance 
Refs.) have been devoted afterwards 
to dealing with this problem through more direct and general methods of 
quantum field theory. As we have seen above, an important approach to 
compute the correlation functions is the one based on the form factors, 
in which the correlators are expressed as sums over multiparticle 
asymptotic states. In our example this series can be explicitly 
resummed and the correlators are given in terms of solutions 
of non-linear differential equations. Moreover, there is a simple 
unified treatment of the bosonic and fermionic cases, with the final 
result expressed by the correspondence(We use the notation 
.)  
 _j(x) _k(0)=1 V _j/N (x)V _k/N (0) ,
where the correlators on the l.h.s. are computed in the theory ()
with , and those on the r.h.s. refer to the operators

in the sine-Gordon theory
A _sG =d^2x[1 2 
_^with  and  a suitably chosen mass scale. 
The theory () with  is in 
fact a free fermionic theory. For generic values of 
the elementary excitations are the solitons and antisolitons interpolating 
between adjacent vacua of the periodic potential. Their interaction is 
attractive as long as  and they form topologically 
neutral bound states, the lightest one being the particle interpolated by 
the bosonic field in the action (). These neutral particles are 
absent from the spectrum of asymptotic states in the repulsive region
, and at the point  where the 
solitons behave as free Dirac fermions.

Since the solitons are non-local in terms of the field ,
the evaluation of both sides of Eq.() amounts to computing
correlation functions of operators which are non-local with respect to 
non-interacting particles, bosons for the l.h.s. and fermions for the r.h.s. 
The different statistics of the two particles is responsible 
for the inversion in Eq.(). 

Consider then a theory of free, charge conjugated particles  and 
 with mass , and denote by  a scalar operator 
having a non-locality phase  () with 
respect to (the field which interpolates) the particle  (). 
Acting on the vacuum state , such an operator produces 
neutral states consisting of pairs . 
The equations satisfied by the form factors of these theories 
&& f^_n(_1,,_n,_1,,_n) = 


&& =0 _(0)A(_1),,
A(_n),A (_1),,A (_n)
are a particular case of those holding for generic integrable theories 
(see e.g.)
* 
where 
S=
 
.
It is easy to check that the solution of the above system of 
equations is given by 
&& f^_n(_1,,_n,_1,,_n) =
S^n(n+2)/2 (-)^n 

&& e^(S,1 )
_i=1 ^n(_i-_i) 
A_n_(S) ,
where  is a  matrix () with entries
A_ij =1 _i-_j 2  ,
and  denotes the 
permanent(The permanent of a matrix differs from the 
determinant by the omission of the alternating sign factors .)  
of  for  and the determinant of  for . 

The two-point correlators are then given by
* 
where
&& g^(,(t) = 
f_n^(_1,,_n)f_n^,_1)
e^-t e_n  

&=& (Se^(i=1 ^n(_i-_i) 

&&  
A_n_(S) ^2 e^-t e_n ,

and 





Analogously to the procedure followed in, we define
a new  matrix  with entries
&& M_ij M(_i,_j)=
(1/2 
e^-t 2 _i 

&& h(_i)h^-1 (_j) _i-_j 2  
e^-t 2 _j ,
where 



and rewrite  as
g^(,(S)  =

 
_(S) .
Finally we symmetrise with respect to the two sets of rapidities by 
introducing a charge index  which is  for a particle  
and  for , so that we express the correlation functions 
as

G_,(S) (t) & =& 
_L=0 ^1 L!(2)^L __1_L 
d_1d_L  

& & K__i _j (_i,_j) 
_(S) ,
where we have introduced the  matrices with entries
&& K_+- (,)=M(,),

&& K_-+ (,)=M(,), 

&& K_++ (,)=K_- (,)=0.The last equation in () ensures that only the terms with  
occur in (). Notice that the dependence on the statistics in 
() only reduces to taking the permanent or the determinant of 
the same matrix. According to the theory of Fredholm integral operators 
(see e.g.) the above expression is equal to 
G_,(S) (t)=Det (1+2K )^-S ,
so that the correlators of operators having the same non-locality 
phase in the free fermion and free boson theories are the inverse 
of each other. This conclusion was first obtained in 
studying the deformation theory of differential equations.
The result () follows from the fact that the 
operators  have a non-locality phase  
around the solitons at the sine-Gordon free fermion point (see 
e.g.), so that  and  have the same 
non-locality with respect to the corresponding particles. Since  
runs between  and , we are actually working with 
.

Once Eq.() has been obtained by using the large 
distance expansion of the correlators, it is an interesting 
check to see how this inversion relation between the two correlators 
works in the short distance limit. Both in the bosonic and fermionic 
case the operators  satisfy the OPE 
_(x)_x^-
^(S) _,+with
^(S) _,(S) _ +X^(S) _X^(S) _+ being the scaling dimensions. In the bosonic case the 
index  is taken modulo .
The scaling dimensions can be computed through the formula 
X_^(S) = -1 2 d^2x
(x) _(0)_connected ,
where  is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. Since the only
non-zero form factor of this operator in the free theories is
0(0)A()A ()m^2[-i
2 ]^_S,-1  ,
one easily finds
X^(S) _
 
.
in agreement with the conjugation properties  and 
. These results coincide with those of conformal 
field theory with 'twist' fields (see). It follows
^(-) _,,
^(+) _,
 
.
The agreement for  is obtained by observing that in 
this range of , the leading short distance term in the 
fermionic case is not the one in () but the first off-critical 
contribution
/2d^2yV_(x)V_(0)[V_1(y)+
V_-1 (y)]_,
which indeed behaves as  when 
.

In general, the two-point functions we are dealing with can be expressed as 
G_,(S) (t)=e^S_,where  is given by 
&& _,t/2 ^d


&& 
[(_)^2-4^2(^2 ],
with  satisfying the differential equation
^2_+1  _2+
(^2 (1-^2) 
with suitable boundary conditions.
The short distance behaviour for  is given by 
_t0 G_,(S) (t)=(C_,t^2-S ,
with an amplitude that can be deduced from the work of 
Ref.on vacuum expectation values in the sine-Gordon model:
&& C_,-2
 

&& 2_0^dt t 
[t(+^2t  + 
. .

&&. . --2t ]
.
Finally, let us discuss the case in which we have a  symmetry. 
This is somehow special since a broken phase with two degenerate 
vacua can be realised in terms of a neutral  boson. In fact, 
a disorder operator with non-locality factor  is present also 
in the theory of a neutral bosonic free particle. It is easy to check 
that, for  and , the form factors () 
imply the factorisation
_1=_(1) _(2) ,N=2
where  is the disorder operator with scaling dimension 
 associated to the neutral boson  entering the 
decomposition , .

The fermion-boson correspondence observed above for charged particles has 
an analogue in the neutral case, and the correlation function
G(t)= _(j) (x) _(j) (0)[G^(+) _1/2,1/2 (t)]^1/2 
can be related to correlators computed in the theory of a free neutral 
fermion, i.e. in the Ising field theory without magnetic field. To see 
this, let us recall that the correlators of the spin and disorder operators in the 
unbroken phase of the scaling Ising model can be written as&& _(t) (x) (0)                (x)(0)

&& = [12 (t/2)-12 _1/2,1/2 (t)],

where the functions  and  are those of 
Eqs.(), (). Hence, it follows from () 
and () that
G(t)=[_+(t)_-(t)]^-1/2 .
Concerning the short distance behaviour of this correlator, the power law
() acquires in this case a logarithmic correction due to the 
'resonance' with the leading off-critical contribution (). Such 
a contribution to the correlator 
 behaves as 
 in the limit 
, so that
_t0 G_1/2,1/2 ^(-) (t)=
_t0 G^-2 (t) = B t^1/2 (1/t),
with
B  = - 4Res _, =0.588353...
and this amplitude coincides with that of the product 
 in the Ising model.

The considerations of this section have recently been extended to the case
of massive ghost theories. In all these cases the  
correlation functions of disorder operators can be computed exactly for free
theories and are related to the same differential equation 
(). In absence of interaction, the correlators are non-trivial due
to the non-locality between the operators and the particles. 
The resummation of the spectral series for interacting theories remains a 
challanging task even in presence of integrability.

Non-integrable Deformations 

The free bosonic and fermionic theories discussed above can also be regarded 
as describing phases of spontaneously broken  symmetry. In this dual
vision, the excitations are free kinks  
interpolating between two adjacent vacua  and 
 (the indices are taken modulo ). Let us denote by 
, , the operators we are interested in. They 
correspond to the exponential operators  in the fermionic 
case(In this case the N degenerate vacua can be identified with 
those of the periodic potential in () identified modulo N.) , and 
to the operators , dual to the disorder operators , in 
the bosonic case. These operators create multikink excitations with 
zero topologic charge, i.e. starting and ending in the same vacuum state. 
Form factors on kink states were discussed in. Consider 
for the sake of simplicity the two-kink matrix elements
F_j,k ^(_1-_2)0_j_k/N (0)K_j,j1 (_1)
K_j1,j (_2),
satisfying the equations 
* 
Since the generator  of  transformations () acts 
on states and operators as ()
&& K_j,j+1 (_1)K_j+1,j+2 (_2)
= 

&& = K_j+1,j+2 (_1)K_j+2,j+3 (_2),


&&  ^-1 _k/N (x)= ^k_k/N (x),

the above form factor equations can be rewritten as 
F_j,k ^(+2i) &=& S^k F_j,k ^(), 


Res _j,k ^() & = & 
i(1-^k )0_j_k/N 0_j.

Once the identifications 
,  are made,
these relations are equivalent to the previous equations for the 
Form Factors with . This correspondence is easily extended 
to all values of  and leads to the same form factors 
and correlation functions discussed for the unbroken phase. 

The introduction of a 'magnetic field' pointing in the  direction and
breaking explicitely the  symmetry corresponds to adding to the free 
action a term
hd^2x_k(x),
where 
_k(x) = 1 N _l=0 ^N-1 ^-kl 
_l/N (x). 
The first 
order corrections to the energy density  of the vacuum 
state  and to the mass  of the kink 
 can be computed according to the Form Factor 
Perturbation Theory proposed in&& _jh0_j_k0_jj,k 
,

&& m_j,j1 ^2h0_j_k(0)K_j,j1 (i)
K_j1,j (0).
It follows from the residue equation written above that 
&& Res _0_j_k(0)K_j,j1 ()
K_j1,j (0)= 


&& iv N (_j,k -_j,k1 
), 
This formula implies that the correction to the mass of the kinks 
interpolating between the vacua  and  
is infinite. This divergence simply reflects the fact that these kinks 
become unstable because the magnetic field removes the degeneracy of 
the vacuum  with the two adjacent vacua. These kinks 
are then confined in pairs  and the 
confinement gives rise to a string of bound states with zero 
topologic charge, as discussed in more details in.
