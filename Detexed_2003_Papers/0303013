We study a class of time dependent solutions 
of the vacuum Einstein equations which are plane waves 
with weak null singularities. 
This singularity is weak in the sense that 
though the tidal forces diverge at the singularity, 
the rate of divergence is such that the distortion suffered by
a freely falling observer remains finite.
Among such weak singular plane waves there is a sub-class which do not exhibit
large back reaction in the presence of test scalar probes.
String propagation in these backgrounds is smooth
and there is a natural way  
to continue the  metric beyond the
singularity. This continued metric admits string propagation
without the string becoming infinitely excited. 
We construct a one parameter family of smooth metrics which are at a
finite distance in the space of metrics from the extended metric and
a well defined operator in the string sigma model 
which resolves the singularity.

Introduction 


There has been a lot of interest in time dependent backgrounds in string
theory. This has been mainly motivated by the desire to understand 
the cosmological singularity or the singularity behind horizons of  black holes
within string theory. These singularities are space like unlike the 
time like orbifold singularities which have been well understood in string
theory. The simplest time dependent backgrounds which can be constructed in
string theory 
are  orbifolds involving either a boost or a null boost 
which  have space like singularities and null singularities
respectively at their fixed point 


. 
Though these backgrounds are simple to construct and one can quantize the string
modes they have been shown to be  potentially
unstable to formation of space like singularities like that of
the ones behind horizons of black holes when probed by test particles. 
In 
it was shown that the introduction of a single particle in the
covering space of orbifolds by null boosts 
causes the space to collapse to a space like
singularity, in it was shown how 
a  homogeneous energy distribution in the transverse directions causes the
singularity in the orbifolds by null boosts to become space like. 
and in 
it was argued that this instability was reflected in the
divergence of string scattering amplitudes.  
Other time dependent backgrounds constructed involved
orbifolding with boosts and a translation in an orthogonal direction 
and  orbifolding with null boosts and a translation
. For the case or orbifolding with a
boosts and a translation the singularity is time like and is resolved
in string theory by orientifold planes and 
they are shown to be stable to perturbations in
.
Other simple time dependent backgrounds were studied in 



Perhaps the next simplest backgrounds involving null singularities in string
theory are exact plane waves with null singularities. 
Their metric is given by 
p-wave 
ds^2 = dudv + F_ij (u) x^i x^j du^2 + dx^i dx^i.
If  is traceless they are solutions to the vacuum Einstein equations
and for  they are solutions in string theory if they are
supported by appropriate  antisymmetric tensor-form field strengths  
or a non constant dilaton. These exact plane wave backgrounds are singular
from the general relativity point of view 
if  diverges at some point  
(see for instance in) 
String propagation on these backgrounds were explored in 
and more recently, 
 
have investigated a plane wave in which the
classical string equations of motion can be solved explicitly.

As plane waves with null singularities are not obtained by an orbifold of
Minkowski space they do not posses the instability found in 
 for the case of oribolds
involving boosts and null boosts. 
They are exact solutions of string theory to all orders in 
. The presence of the covariantly
constant null Killing vector 
ensures absence of particle production in these
backgrounds and 
that they preserve half the supersymmetry when embedded
in super string theory.
This makes them good candidates to study the issue of null singularities in
string theory though in general the string modes cannot be quantized explicitly.

In this paper we study a class of plane waves which are solutions of the vacuum
Einstein equations with a weak null singularity.
They are weak in the sense defined in,  the tidal forces
diverge at the singularity but the distortion caused by them on an object freely
falling into the singularity
remains finite.  Among these weak singularities we find a sub-class
in which the back reaction on a test scalar probe remains finite at the
singularity. This and the fact that the singularity is weak ensures that 
classical string modes 
and their first derivative  remains finite at the singularity.
Thus there is a natural way to continue them across the singularity 
by matching the modes and their first derivative 
across the singularity to extend the metric beyond
it.  

In string theory, for a plane wave to be non-singular not only should 
the string modes be extended across the singularity but also the 
the string should not become infinitely excited as it passes
through the singularity. 
For instance in the case of 
exact plane waves which  are vacuum solutions of Einstein's
equations with a delta function singularity (eg. 
 ) the string modes can be continued across the singularity
but the string gets infinitely excited as
it passes through it and therefore this plane wave is singular from
the point of view of string theory.
In the case of weak singular plane waves which are studied in this paper we show
that the string modes continued across the singularity are not infinitely
excited, thus justifying the extended metric.
As further support for the extended metric we show that there exists a
family of smooth metrics which are at a finite distance in the space of metrics
from the extended metric. We demonstrate 
the existence of a deformation which smoothes out the singularity.  

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we 
introduce the backgrounds we will study in this paper and review the notion of a
weak singularity. We show that among weak singular plane waves there is a subset
for which the energy of a test scalar particle does not diverge at the
singularity ensuring that the back reaction is mild. 
In section 3 we study string propagation in this background,
we show that the classical string modes 
and their first  derivative is finite at the singularity,
this allows one to smoothly continue them across the singularity.
In section 4 we show that the string does not get infinitely excited as it
passes through the singularity in the extended metric. Then we show that there
are smooth metrics which are a finite distance in the moduli space from the
extended metric and the existence of a well defined operator in the string
sigma model which resolves the singularity.
In section 5 we state our conclusions.


Plane waves with  weak singularities 

In this section we review the conditions of when a plane wave is singular and
demonstrate 
when they have weak singularities. We then show that among the  class of weakly
singular plane waves there is a subset in which the stress energy tensor of a
test scalar does not diverge at the singularity.

A singular plane wave 

For the purposes of this paper we restrict our attention 
to the following metric
epwave 
ds^2 = dudv + F(u) (x^2 - y^2) du^2 + dx^2 + dy^2,
these are solutions to the vacuum Einstein equations.
The considerations in this paper can be generalized to other plane wave
solutions.   in epwave  
is any function which vanishes  at infinity and singular at .
For example  with  satisfies this criteria.
The metric is defined for , the geodesic equations for 
this metric is given by
geo 
& &d^2 u d^2  = 0, 
 & &d^2 x d^2  -F(u) x (du d )^2= 0, 
 & &d^2 y d^2  + F(u) y (du d )^2 = 0,  
 & &d d  ( d u d  dv d  +
(d x d )^2 + (d y d )^2 + 
F(u) (x^2-y^2) (du d )^2  ) =0,
where  refers to the affine parameter.
It is clear that from these equations that 
if there is a singularity in  at  
the space time exists only for 
as every time like geodesic with  , 
, reaches the singularity at .
The point  is not a scalar curvature singularity as all curvature
invariants vanish for the  plane wave metric. One can  characterize the
singular behaviour of the curvature tensor in a coordinate invariant way as
follows. Consider a time like geodesic which ends at the singularity, 
an orthonormal frame which is parallel propagated 
along this geodesic is given by
orth-frame 
e_0 = ( p, v , x , y  ), &&e_1 = ( p, v  + 2 p , x , y  ), 
 e_2 = (0, -2 x  p , 1, 0 ) , &&e_3 = (0, -2 y  p , 0, 1).
Here  is the velocity for the  coordinate, 
the vector  is the tangent to the geodesic and normalized as 
, the dot refers to derivative with respect to the affine parameter
. 
The components of the Riemann curvature with respect
to this frame diverge at the singularity, they are given by
cur-frame 
R_2121  = -p^2 F, R_3232  = p^2 F, 
 R_2020  = -p^2 F, R_3030  = p^2 F.
Condition for a plane wave with a weak singularity 

When  a body falls into this singularity the tidal forces  diverge.
The tidal forces 
suffered by an object falling into the singularity in 
its parallel propagated  frame 
are given by the  curvature components in the time like directions in
cur-frame . 
The singularity is weak if the rate of divergence is small enough so
that the object is not distorted as it hits the singularity. 
The distortion is proportional to the second integral of the tidal force
. 
Consider the case of power law divergence at the origin ,
the distortion is finite at the origin if 

This notion was  made more precise by. A singularity is defined to
be weak if for every time like geodesic which ends on it there exists  linearly
independent space like vorticity-free Jacobi fields along the geodesic normal to
its tangent vector which define a volume element that remains finite
at the singularity. This captures the intuitive notion of the distortion 
of the object being finite. We now verify that for the case of power law
divergence  with  the Jacobi fields define a
finite volume element at the singularity.

Jacobi fields satisfy the geodesic deviation equations, in the orthonormal frame
orth-frame  the space like Jacobi fields satisfy
geod-dev 
& &d^2 ^1 d^2  = 0, 
 & &d^2 ^2 d^2  - p^2 1 u^  ^2 = 0, 

& &d^2 ^3 d^2  +p^2 1 u^  ^3 = 0,
here .
The geodesic deviation equation is diagonal, that is it does not mix the
space like Jacobi fields  among each other, therefore the vorticity of
these Jacobi fields is zero. 
Solutions of  these equations 
for  are known in closed form.  Consider the time like
geodesic with , 
an example of Jacobi
fields which remain finite at the origin is given by
jaco-fin 
^1 = + 1, ^2 = p K_  (2(p)^1 2 ), ^3 = p Y_  (2(p)^1 2 ),
where  and  and  are the Bessel function and
the modified Bessel function respectively.
From exp-ky , exp-ki  and exp-yi , it is
clear that these functions are finite at the origin.
Thus the volume defined by the product
 is finite at the origin. 
Therefore for power law
divergences , the singularity is weak if .
Note that not only the volume defined by the Jacobi fields is finite for these
class of singularities but also each of the Jacobi field is finite at the
singularity.

Scalars fields in a weakly singular plane wave 

We now show that among the class of weak singularities 
discussed in the previous section we can find a subclass for which 
the stress energy tensor of a massless scalar does not diverge as seen by 
any time like observer falling in to the singularity.
The evaluation of the stress energy tensor 
in the frame of the in falling time like observer  provides an invariant 
method of testing whether the scalar field will cause an  
infinite back reaction at the singularity or not. This method of testing
for back reaction of a scalar in the presence of 
null singularities is common in the literature, 
see for instance in.

It is convenient to work in the Rosen coordinate system which are well behaved at
the singularity. The details of the various Rosen coordinate systems  
for the plane wave with  and  
are given in the appendix.
In this coordinates the metric for the plane wave is given by
ro 
ds^2 = dd+ f^2() d^2 + g^2() d^2,
where  and  are 
def-fg 
f() =   K_(2^1 2  ), g() =   Y_(2^1 2  ).
These Rosen coordinates are well behaved at the singularity , from the
expansions in exp-ky , exp-ki  and exp-yi , it is clear that they
are finite at the origin.
The massless scalar wave equation in the background ro  reduces to
waveq 
1 fg  ( 
_  ( 2fg_  ) + _ (2 fg
_  ) + _ ( g f   _  ) + 
_ ( f g  _  )  ) =0.
The above equations are invariant under translations in , therefore
we can solve these equations by assuming the form 
. 
Substitution this form in waveq  we obtain
an ordinary equation for . The complete solution for  is given by
scalwave 
(, w, k_x, k_y) = 1 fg   
(i+ ik_x + ik_y + 1 4i 
d( k_x^2 f^2  + k_y^2 g^2  ) ).
Note that the wave function is well defined and smooth at the origin. The
nontrivial dependence of this wave function is in the  coordinate. 
The derivative of the wave function with respect to  is 
given by
derscal 
_= 
( -1 2  _( fg) fg  + 1 4iw (
k_x^2 f^2  + k_y^2 g^2 ) ) . 
As  and  are well behaved at the origin
the behaviour of the derivative at the origin is dictated by the of logarithmic
derivative of the product  at the origin. From the expansions in
exp-ij , exp-ky , exp-ki  and exp-yi  it is clear that this
derivative is finite only for . The stress energy tensor is a
bilinear function of the derivatives of the scalar field, therefore we expect
the stress energy tensor evaluated in the frame of the in falling observer
will be well behaved for . 


The general solutions for the scalar field is given by
gen-sol 
(, , , ) = d w dk_x dk_y (w, k_x, d_y) (w, k_x, k_y)
Here  are the Fourier coefficients which are determined by
boundary conditions given on a constant  surface. If the boundary conditions
are given in a patch which is beyond 
the validity of the Rosen coordinates ro , then by solving
the wave equation in that patch corresponding to the boundary conditions 
and using the overlap
of patches one can determine  (One might have to go
through  several Rosen coordinate patches.) . 
For simplicity in our analysis 
we will assume our boundary conditions are such that 
. This is basically
assuming the scalar field is independent in  and  and it is a
cosine wave with frequency . The analysis which we detail below can be easily
repeated for an arbitrary Fourier coefficient 
The non-zero components of the stress energy tensor of the cosine wave 
 are given by
stress-cos 
T_  &=& ( _(fg) fg  )^2 ^2(w), 

T_  &=& w^2 ^2 (w), 
 T_  &=& f^2 w_(fg) 2fg   (w) (w), 

T_  &=& f^2 w _(fg) 2fg   (w) (w). 
All the components are well behaved at the origin if  . The stress
energy tensor for the sine wave is obtained by replacing the cosines by the
sines and vice-versa in the above formulae.

One might suspect that the reason that the stress energy tensor is well behaved
is due to the choice of nice coordinates near the singularity and a coordinate
artifact.  In fact if the
stress energy tensor given in stress-cos  is converted to the 
plane wave coordinates in  epwave  the
stress energy tensor is divergent. The natural way to check if the stress
energy tensor is divergent in a coordinate invariant manner is to
evaluate the components of
the stress energy tensor as seen in the frame of an observer traveling on 
any time like geodesic.  We now show that that the stress
energy tensor of a scalar field seen by a in falling observer is finite in the
class of singular plane waves with  with .
The geodesic equations in Rosen coordinates are
given by
geod 
d^2  d^2  &=& 0, 
 d^2  d^2  + 2f  f d d  
d d  &=&0,

 d^2  d^2  + 2g  g 
d d  d d  &=&0,

 d d  ( 
d d  + 
f^2 ( d d )^2 + g^2 (d d )^2
) &=&0.
The solutions for the tangent vector along the geodesic is given by
geodtgt 
& &d d  = 1, 
d d  = a f^2 , 
d d  = b g^2 , 
 & &d d  = -1- a^2 f^2  - b^2 g^2 
Here we have scaled  so that velocity in the  direction is unity and 
normalized the tangent vector such that  its norm is .  and  are
arbitrary constants. Note that the velocity along the  direction is finite
in the Rosen coordinates unlike the case in the plane wave coordinates as in
geo .
Let the tangent vector along the geodesic be denoted by . The other
vectors in the parallel propagated orthonormal tetrad along this geodesic are
ro-orth 
& &v_1 = 
(1, 1- a^2 f^2  -b^2 g^2 , a f^2 , b g^2  ),

 & &v_2 = ( 0, -2a f , 1 f , 0) , 
 & & v_3 = (0, -2b g  , 0, 1 g  ).
It is clear that since all the components of this tetrad are well behaved at
 the stress energy tensor in this frame will be well behaved. 
For instance the  component of the
stress energy tensor of the scalar field in the frame of the in falling
observer is given by
stess-in 
T_00  &=& T_  v^_0 v^_0, 
 &=& T_  + T_ (d d )^2 + T_  
(d d  )^2 +
T_ (d d  )^2.
It is clear from stress-cos  and  from geodtgt  the above expression for
 is well behaved at . Similarly from stress-cos  and 
ro-orth  the other components also will be well behaved at the singularity.
The apparent divergence of the stress energy tensor 
in the  plane wave coordinate given in epwave  
is canceled when contracted with the velocity vectors of the
geodesic. Note that in geo 
the velocity vector along the  direction diverges.

Thus for the subclass of plane wave singularities which diverge as 
 with  the stress energy tensor of a scalar field as seen
by an in falling geodesic does not diverge, therefore these backgrounds are
classically stable from large back reaction effects for a scalar probe.


Strings in weak singular plane waves  


In this section we study string propagation in plane waves with weak
singularities. We 
show that that the classical 
string modes for plane waves with singularity of the form
 and   are well behaved at the singularity,
in fact even the derivative of the string modes are well behaved. This suggests a
natural method for 
extension of the metric in epwave  beyond the singularity . 
Considering the metric as  
One can match the classical string modes and its derivative at  and
continue the modes smoothly across  . 
We discuss this continuation of the string modes in  this section and 
will  provide more
justification for this extension of the metric in the  section 4.

Consider the metric given in epwave  embedded in bosonic string theory
(This discussion can be easily extended for the case of the
superstring.) .
The world sheet action of the bosonic string is given by
ws-act 
S &=& -1 4d d(
_a U ^a V + F(U) (X^2 -Y^2) _a U ^a U 
. 
 &&+ . 
_a X ^a X  + _a Y ^a Y 
 +  _a X^i ^a X_i ). 
Here , we have used 
the Minkowski signature for the world sheet metric. The classical string modes
can be studied in the light cone gauge,  
substituting   in the action ws-act  we 
obtain
ls-act 
S &=& -1 4dd(
-pdV d   -p^2 F(p) (X^2 -Y^2)  . 
 && 
. + _a X ^a X  + _a Y ^a Y 
+ _a X^i ^a X_i ). 
The
coordinates  are free and their solution is given by the usual mode
expansion, we will ignore these modes in our discussion. 
The non-trivial equations of motion are for the  and  fields, they are
given by
non-eq 
^a_a X + p^2F(p) X &=& 0,  
 ^a _a Y - p^2 F(p) Y &=& 0.
Translations in the world sheet coordinate  is a symmetry of the above
equations, this and the fact that  is a periodic coordinate imply that
we can expand the modes as
mod-exp 
X(, ) = _n=- ^n=  X_n() 
e^in  , Y(, ) = _n=- ^n=  Y_n () e^in  
where  and  satisfy the differential equations
xy-diff 
X _n + n^2 X_n - p^2F(p) X_n &=& 0, 
 Y _n + n^2 Y_n + p^2 F(p) Y_n &=& 0. 
Thus the equations for the classical modes reduce to equations for time
dependent oscillators with repulsive and attractive potentials.  
The classical modes for the coordinate  is
determined by the following constraint equations
constr 
-pV  &=& (X )^2 + (Y )^2 + (X')^2 + (Y')^2  + F(p) (X^2- Y^2),

 -p V' &=& 2 ( X  X' + Y  Y' ),
here the derivatives are with respect to the world sheet coordinates.


Let us now discuss the modes for  
singular plane waves with  and 
. 
The zero modes for the  and  coordinates 
are the geodesic equations for these coordinates in geo , 
their solutions are given by
zero-mode 
X_0 &=& _0 p  I_( 2(p)^1/2  )
+  _0 p  K_( 2(p)^1/2  ), 

Y_0 &=& _0 p  J_( 2(p)^1/2  )
+  _0 p  Y_( 2(p)^1/2  ),
where  and 
 are arbitrary constants. ,  and , 
are the Bessel functions and modified Bessel functions respectively.
Note that for ,  
always lies between  and , and therefore  never takes on integral
values. From the expansion of these 
Bessel functions given in 
exp-ij  and exp-ky  it is easy to see that they are finite and their
derivatives are also finite at the origin for .

Consider the non zero modes for the coordinate , the behaviour of these
modes can at  can be studied by substituting 
in xy-diff  with 
 the
equations of motion for   then reduces to
xn-eq 
x _n + 
2x _n 1 h(p)  d d  h(p)  + n^2 x_n = 0,
where we have used the fact that  solves the equation
eqoh 
h  + 1 ^  h =0.
The expansion for  is given by
exp-h 
h() = ^-  ( 1 ( -+1)  + ^2
^2-  1!(-+2)  + ^4 ^2(2-)  2!(
-+3)   + ),
it is clear from the above expansion that the logarithmic derivative of  goes
to zero at  if . Therefore from xn-eq  the two linearly
independent solutions for  as  are given by
sol-xn 
X_n = e^in p 
I_-  ( 2(p)^1 2  ) 
( 1 + O(^2- ) ),
as  0.
The fact that these solutions are linearly independent can be shown by the
evaluation of the Wronskian. 
Thus the modes are well behaved at  furthermore 
from sol-xn  it is also clear that the derivatives are also well behaved at
the origin.
A similar argument for the modes  shows that they are given by
sol-yn 
Y_n = e^in p  
J_-  ( 2(p)^1 2   )
( 1 + O(^2- ) ) , 
as  0.
Thus the modes for the  and its derivative are also well behaved at
the origin.
We have also checked the 
the fact that these modes are well behaved at the origin 
by a Frobenius expansion which can be performed for 
rational values of  and numerically. Note that the in determining the
behaviour of the modes the crucial role was played by the change of variable
from  to . This transformation is precisely the transformation to a
specific Rosen coordinates as can be seen from cortrans .
The modes of the coordinate  is determined from the constraints 
constr , it is easy to see from these equations that  is finite but
 in general diverges at the origin.

We now outline a  natural completion of the plane wave metric with 
a power law divergence in 
 and  to the region . Consider the extension to be
the plane wave metric with  at the origin, 
then if the two linearly independent solutions for  are 
 and  for , the two linear independent
solutions for  are given by  and .
We have seen that for  these modes and their derivatives are well
behaved at the origin, therefore one can match the value of the modes and their
derivative for the solutions in the two regions at the origin and naturally
continue them across the singularity. This procedure cannot
be done for the case of singularities with  as the derivative of
the modes diverge at the origin. 
The modes for the world sheet coordinate  is determined from the 
constraints given in constr . 
Note that in this completion of the metric the zero modes as well as the
non-zero modes of the string are in equal footing, unlike the case of the usual 
orbifolds in which geodesics or the zero modes cannot be completed while the
non-zero modes of the string can be extended (The author thanks Ashoke
Sen for pointing this out.) .


Tests for the extended metric 

We have seen in the previous section 
that for plane waves with singularity  that there is a  
natural
extension of the metric to  with . One can ensure that
all the string modes are continuous and differentiable at the origin for
. This still does not guarantee that the metric is singularity free
from the point of view of string theory. Though plane wave metrics do not
exhibit particle creation there is a phenomenon of mode creation, a string
passing through the singularity can become excited, for the metric to be
non-singular from the point of view of string theory it is important to show
that mode creation is finite. For instance with 
though the modes can be continued across the singularity (the derivative is
discontinuous) the string gets infinitely excited as it passes through this
singularity. This infinte excitation is infact due to the infinite
extent of the shock wave profile  and it similar to the case of
 

In this section we show that the mode creation in the continued metric with
 and   is finite, this was noticed in
. 
The extension of the metric to  will also be natural if there exists a
family of smooth metrics which are at a finite distance 
from the metric  in the space of
metrics. Then this extended metric is just a point in the moduli space, much
like the case of the  orbifold, the singular  metric is
just a limit of the smooth Eguchi-Hansen space.
We construct such a family of smooth metrics for the extended metric.
We also show that there is a well defined
operator in the string sigma model which resolves the singularity.
Thus this class of plane wave metrics can be smoothened out much like the 
 orbifold singularity.


Mode creation 


The world sheet theory for the string in these time dependent backgrounds has
time dependent potentials. Time dependent potentials in general will mix
positive frequencies and negative frequencies  on the world sheet, which implies 
there is a transition amplitude between the oscillator modes of the vacuum at
 to the oscillator modes of the vacuum at 
, here  stands for the world sheet time. 
The mixing of modes will in general excite  string modes as it passes through the
time dependent background.
To compute the amplitude for mode creation through a time dependent back ground
one needs to know the solution for the differential equations xy-diff .
Solutions for these equations do not exist in closed form ( For the
case  solutions exist in closed form.) , 
we therefore resort to approximate methods. 
Since we are interested in the behaviour close to
the singularity our methods should be valid in that region. 
It is easy to see that for  the WKB method is not valid
close to  , the other approximate method is perturbation theory.
In the (mass) of the excited modes for the 
case strings passing through plane waves 
singularities with  was estimated using
first order perturbation theory and show to be finite.
Here we emphasize the validity doing perturbation theory 
in spite of the presence of the singularity at  
We estimate the mode creation to the second order in perturbation theory and
show that string does not get infinitely excited as it passes through the
singularity. 

As we are only interested in the singularity at the origin we can assume that
the function  is modulated by a function which
is smooth and falls of at infinity. 
To keep the calculations involved simple  
we perform the analysis  below with 
for  and  for  sufficiently large but finite.
We set up the perturbation theory for the modes of the coordinate .
A similar treatment will go through for the coordinate .
The solution of equations of motions for the world sheet coordinate 
 is given in terms of the following series
sol-x-ser 
X_n ()&=& X_n^(0) ()  + d_1 G(-_1)
p^2F(p_1)X_n^(0) (_1) 

&+& d_2 d_1 G(p^2F(p_2) G(_2 -_1) p^2
F(p_1) X_n^(0) (_1) +  All the integrals run from  to .
The expansion parameter can be thought of as the light cone momentum . 
 is the solution of the unperturbed equation 
unperteq 
X_n ^(0)  + n^2 X_n^(0)  = 0, 
and   is its Green's function which is given by
greenbc 
G(= (2in  ( e^in(-
e^-in(-),
where  is the step function which ensures that the above
Green's function vanishes for . We require this boundary condition
as we are propagating the solutions from  to 
.
It is clear from the perturbative expansion in sol-x-ser  all the integrals 
are well defined if   with . 
This is because the interaction potential  always occurs with an
integration in , so the integrals around  are well defined
(For  the perturbation expansion truncates at the
first order giving the exact answer.) .
Note that it is not clear that one can trust the perturbative analysis for
.

For mode creation what is important is to obtain the amplitude of the incoming
wave after scattering from the potential. 
Consider the incoming wave at  as ,
then the amplitude of the coefficient of the outgoing wave  at 

is given by
in-sc 
B_ne^-in  = _-  d( G(-- 1 in  d d  G(-) V(e^in
Here  refers to the coefficient of the outgoing wave and
 stands for full Green's function whose expansion is given by
green-full 
G  (-= G(- + d_1 G(-_1)p^2F(p_1) G(-+ Evaluating  to the  first order in perturbation theory gives
first-or 
B^(1) _n = F ( -2n)  2in 
Here  is the Fourier transform of the potential defined by
.
For the potential  with  it is given by
ft-pot 
F (w) =  2 p^2-  
w^1-   (1-) ( 2 ) + 
O(1 wT^ ),
where the  terms refers to the corrections due to the 
fact that the potential is non zero only for 
.
From the Bogoliubov transformations for the oscillator modes 
the expectation value of the number operator at  of the vacuum
at  is given by
btrans 
0_+ N_n  0_+ = B_n^2,
where  refers to the number operator  of either the left movers or the
right movers in the th level. 
The expectation value of the number operator can be translated to 
the expectation value of the mass of
the excited string after it passes through the singularity 
which is given by 
mass-ex 
<M^2> = 4 2_n   n <N_n^i>  -2).
From the equations  first-or , ft-pot  and btrans  we see the mass
contribution from the excited modes corresponding to the  coordinate 
in first order perturbation theory is given by 
tot-mass 
<M^2_x> 2 _n 1 n^3-2  .
It is easy to see that this sum converges for . A similar analysis
holds for the  coordinate, thus the (mass) of the excited string remains
finite in first order perturbation theory. 
To show that the leading estimate for the amplitude for mode creation is given
by the first order term we evaluate the 
Bogoliubov coefficient  to the next order in perturbation theory.
This is given by
sec-or2 
B^(2) _n &=& 
1 2n^2   ( F (-2n) F  (0)   -
F (-4n) F (-2n) ), 
 &=& p^2(2-)  2n^2(n^1- )   [
2T^1-  1-  - ( 1 4n  )^1-  ]
+ O(1 nT^ ), 
note that   
is suppressed by higher powers of  and is finite for a
given , therefore the amplitude for mode creation given in tot-mass  is
the leading estimate.


Nonsingular metrics close to the extended  metric  

In this section we show that there exists a one parameter 
family of smooth metrics which are at a finite distance from 
plane wave metrics given in epwave  with a
singularity of the form  with  
at the origin.
The natural way to find a smooth metric which reduces to this singular metric in
a limit is to deform the function  to any smooth function at . For
instance the function  is a possible candidate.
The difficulty in considering these kind deformations is that 
they are all null deformations, that is their distance in the
space of metrics is null. 
This is easily seen as follows, 
the distance in the space of metrics is given by
dist-met 
= d^4 x g  g^  g^  g_  g_ ,
where  refers to the change in the metric. Note that the
metric we have in epwave  is such that  is zero if  or
 refers to the  direction. Therefore deformations  involving just the
change in the function  is null. To obtain deformations which smooth out
the singularity one should involve the transverse directions  and , this
is conveniently done in the
Rosen coordinates,  in these coordinates 
the metric in epwave  is given by
ro-ex 
ds^2 = dd+ f() d^2  + g( ) d^2.
The details of the transformation from the usual plane wave coordinates to the
Rosen coordinates are given in cortrans  and difftrans . If 
the singularity in  is of the form  with 
then for the patch containing , 
the functions  and  can be chosen to be
fg-full 
f() =   K_( 2^1 2   ), g() =   Y_( 2^1 2   ). 
We can construct 
a one parameter family of metrics which are not singular at  
as follows. Consider the metric 
family 
ds^2 = dd+ f^2( +a ) d^2 + g^2(+a) dy^2,
where .
These are solutions of the equations of motion if 
  and  satisfy the following equations
cond-sol 
d^2 d^2  f(+a) = F(+a) f(+a), d^2 d^2  g(+a) = -F(+a) g(+a), here .
Therefore in the patch containing ,   and  are given by
fg-shift 
f(+a) = +a  K_( 2(+a )^1 2   ), g(+a) = +a   Y_( 2(+a)^1 2   ). 
When 
this family of metrics reduces to the singular metric characterized by 
.
The metrics in family  are not singular, the curvature components are
proportional to  which does not diverge at the origin.

We now show that the one parameter deformation constructed above is close by to
the singular extended metric by evaluating the Zamolodchikov metric of the
operator responsible for the deformation in the string sigma model. 
The string sigma model for the metric in ro-ex  is given by
ro-sigm 
S= -1 4dd(
_a U ^a U  + f^2 _a X ^a X + g^2 _a Y
^a Y + _a X^i ^a X_i ).
For very small , the deformation of the metric can be obtained by a Taylor
expansion of the function  and  and retaining the first
order term. Then operator which is responsible for this 
infinitesimal  deformation in the string
sigma model is given by
oper 
 O(, ) = 
a( 2f d f d  _a  X ^a X 
+ 2g dg  d  _a Y ^a Y ). 
The Zamolodchikov metric  or the norm  of this operator is defined by
z-met 
G_OO  a^2 = _0  ^4 O  ( , + )
O  ( , ) .
Note that from the expansions of the functions  and  in the appendix this
operator is well defined for .
To evaluate the Zamolodchikov metric it is 
convenient  to appeal to the formula relating it to the
Weil-Petersson metric in the space of metrics 
 which is given by
zwp-rel 
G_OO  a^2 
= 1 V  d^26  x g  g^ 
g^  g_  g_ ,
here  stands for the undeformed metric with  given 
in  ro-ex ,  stands for the infinitesimal deformation
in the metric by the operator oper  and .
After substituting for these from ro-ex  and oper  and canceling out
the volume of the remaining spectator dimensions we obtain
valzmet 
 G_ OO 
= 4 d f^2 g^2   d  f^2 g^2  [
( 1 f d f du  )^2 + 
(1 g  d g du  )^2 ].
As we are only interested in the singularity near the origin  the metric in
ro-ex  can be taken to be that of flat space for . The
integrand in the numerator of above equation is supported over a compact
region in . We render the denominator finite by integrating over a large but
finite region in . (Note that in the
Zamolodchikov metric or the Weil-Pettersson metric was evaluated for 
deformations in Calabi-Yau
manifolds which is compact, therefore there was no need for this regularization.) 
The only possible divergence can be at , in that region the functions
reduce to those given in fg-full . The integrand in valzmet  contains the
logarithmic derivatives of these functions  and 
from the expansions of these function at  it is easy to see 
 is finite for . Therefore the infinitesimal deformation in
oper  can smooth out the singularity at .

Conclusions 


We have seen that plane wave solutions of pure gravity with weak singularities
i.e.   and ,
admit the  sub-class  with ,
which do not exhibit large back reaction in the presence of
scalar probes. 
For these class of plane waves
classical string modes do not diverge
at the singularity. There is a natural way to continue the metric across the
singularity, this extended metric admits string propagation without the string
becoming infinitely excited. 
This extended metric lies at a finite distacne  to a family of smooth metrics in
the space of metrics. The operator which smoothes out the singularity has a
finite norm.
It will be interesting to see if in general there are classes of weak
singularities in which energies of scalar probes do not diverge and 
which admit smooth string propagation. The singularities studied in this paper
were null singularities, 
and it is of interest to see if there are similar weak time like
singularities. 
In plane waves with singularities which are 
supported by  background Neveu-Schwarz -fields 
mode creation can be suppressed due to the coupling of the
-field on the world sheet, here the interplay of the 
singular effect of  the geometry is effectively canceled by 
and that of the -field. This is 
phenomenon is potentially of interest to understand  mechanisms
for resolutions of time dependent singularities.

The fact that weak singularities admit space like
Jacobi fields which define a finite volume element implies that  they can be
used to define a well behaved 
synchronous coordinate system near the singularity.
For the plane wave analyzed in this paper these were the Rosen coordinates.
One can then
impose the requirement for smooth behaviour of scalar and string probes in this
synchronous
coordinate system and translate this  to a condition on the Jacobi
fields. This will provide a useful general condition for 
classification of metrics which admit a weak singularity.

Rosen coordinates 

The plane wave metric given in epwave  is written in 
Brinkman coordinates which are global. 
Near the singularity it is convenient to use Rosen coordinates. 
In fact there is a choice of coordinates such that the metric is well defined at
the singularity if it is weak. To convert to Rosen coordinates we perform the
the following change of coordinates 
 
cortrans 
u &=& , 
 v &=& - df d  f ^2 - dg d  g ^2, 
 x &=& f , 
 y &=& g ,
where  and  satisfy the equations
difftrans 
d^2f d^2  = F() f, 
d^2g d^2  = -F() g. 
Under this coordinate transformation the plane wave metric in epwave  reduces
to 
rosen 
ds^2 = dd+ f^2 d^2 + g^2 d^2.
The general solutions for  and  in  difftrans 
for weak singularities with  and  is given by
deffg 
f() &=& A   
I_  (2^1 2    )
+ B   
K_  (2^1 2    ), 
 g () &=& C   
J_  (2^1 2    )
+ D   
Y_  (2^1 2    ), 
where  and the functions  and 
refer to the Bessel functions and the modified Bessel functions  as
defined in.  One can obtain different Rosen coordinate systems
corresponding to the various choices of the constants  and . 
It is useful to write out the expansions of the functions appearing in
deffg  around the origin, for the functions involving  and  
the expansion are given by
exp-ij 
  I_( 2^1 2   ) = 
^( 1 ( +1) 
+  ^2^2-  1! ( +2) 
+   ^4 ^2(2-)   2!( + 3)   + ), 

   J_( 2^1 2   ) = 
^( 1 ( +1) 
-  ^2^2-  1!( +2) 
+ ^4^2(2-)   2!( + 3)   - ) . 
For the functions involving  and  and when  is not an integer
the expansions are given by
exp-ky 
  K_( 2^1 2  ) &=& 
 2()  ^-  ( 1 ( -+1) 
+  ^2^2-  1! ( -+2) 
+  ^4^2(2-   2!( - + 3)   + )  

&- &  2() 
  I_( 2^1 2  ),  
 
  Y_( 2^1 2  ) &=& 
-1 ()  ^-  ( 1 ( -+1) 
-  ^2^2-  1! ( -+2) 
+   ^4^2(2-)   2!( - + 3)   - ),  


&+ & () 
  J_( 2^1 2  ).
Note that the above functions are finite at the origin.
When  there is a possibility  of
 being an integer, then there
are logarithmic terms in the expansion for  and , still these
functions are finite at the origin,  
the logarithmic terms and the first few terms in the expansion 
of  is given by
exp-ki 
  K_n( 2n ^1 2n  ) &=& (-1)^n+1   u I_n( 2n
^1 2n    ) ( n ^1 2n  ) 
 &+& n^-n  2 ( (n-1)! - (n-2)! n^2^(2-)   2!  +
(-1)^n-1 
n^2(n-2)  ^(n-1)(2-)   (n-1)! ) 
 &+& (-1)^n n^n 2  ( 
( (1) + (n+1) ) n! 
+ ( (2) + (n+2) )n^2^2-   2!(n+2)!  + ),
here  is an integer and  is the digamma function defined
. Similarly the expansion for  is given by
exp-yi 
  Y_n( 2n ^1 2n  ) &=& 2   u J_n( 2n
^1 2n    ) ( n ^1 2n  ) 
 &-& n^-n   ( (n-1)! + (n-2)! n^2^(2-)   2!  +
n^2(n-2)  ^(n-1)(2-)   (n-1)! ) 
 &-& n^n   ( 
( (1) + (n+1) ) n! 
- ( (2) + (n+2) )n^2^2-   2!(n+2)!  + ).
From the above expressions in exp-ky , exp-ki  and exp-yi  it is
clear that for  the functions in deffg  involving  and
 are finite at the origin and from exp-ij  the functions in
deffg  involving  and   vanish at the origin.
The Jacobian
for transformation to the Rosen coordinates is given by the product ,
therefore to have a well defined coordinate system in the patch which contains
,   and  is not zero. 
It is convenient to choose  in the Rosen coordinates in this patch.
