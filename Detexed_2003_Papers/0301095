We give a model-independent derivation of general intersecting rules for
spacelike branes (S-branes) in arbitrary dimensions . This is achieved by
directly solving bosonic field equations for supergravity coupled to
a dilaton and antisymmetric tensor fields with minimal ansa tze.
We compare the results with those in eleven-dimensional supergravity
and other solutions.



There has been much interest in time-dependent and spacelike brane solutions
(S-branes) of supergravities in eleven and ten dimensions because of
its possible connection with tachyon condensations and dS/CFT
correspondence . These theories are the low-energy
limits of the string theories and supposedly unifying M-theory of strings.
Time-dependent solutions are investigated rather recently and not much is
known on these solutions. It is thus important to better understand these
classical -brane solutions.

The single -brane solutions (S-branes) have been discussed in
refs.  for low-energy effective supergravities (see also
refs.  for related solutions). Following the usual convention,
S-branes are used for those with -dimensional Euclidean world-volume.
It has then been noted that the more general solutions can be understood
as intersecting ones of these fundamental -branes  and the
rules how the branes intersect with each other are given in analogy to
the usual branes -. Although the "rules" are consistent
with most of the known solutions, it is not clear if there are any other
solutions than those given by these rules. The questions we would like to
ask here are how general these rules are and how severely they restrict
the solutions for supergravities in  and lower dimensions.

A systematic approach to formulating the rules for the way how they can
intersect has been derived for the usual branes in.
The purpose of this note is to extend this work to the S-branes and
clarify what ansa tze are really necessary. In particular,
we derive the intersection rules from the general approach.
We show that the rules are simple consequences of the field equations,
which can be easily integrated and the consistency of the solutions
reduces the problem of solving the field equations to an algebraic one.

The results of our analysis turn out to be consistent with the
superposition rules in ref.  for  supergravity, but our results
apply to more general supergravity coupled to a dilaton and antisymmetric
tensors. We show that the requirement that the fields for the each brane be
independent is sufficient to give the solutions and intersection rules.

Let us start with the general action for gravity coupled to a dilaton
 and  different -form field strengths:
I = 1 16 G_d  d^d x -g  [
R - ()^2 - _A=1 ^m 1 2 n_A!  e^a_A  
F_n_A ^2 ].
This action describes the bosonic part of  or  supergravities;
we simply drop  and put  and  for , whereas we
set  for the NS-NS 3-form and  for forms coming
from the R-R sector.(There may be Chern-Simons terms in the action,
but they are irrelevant in our following solutions.)  To describe more
general supergravities in lower dimensions, we should include several scalars,
but for simplicity we disregard this complication in this paper.

 From the action (), one derives the field equations











 -10 
_[  F__1 _n_A ]  = 0.
The last equations are the Bianchi identities.

We take the following metric for our system:
ds_d^2 = -e^2u_0  dt^2 + _p  e^2 u_  dy_^2
+ e^2B  d_k, ^2,
where , the coordinates  parametrize the
-dimensional world-volume directions and the remaining coordinates of
the -dimensional spacetime are the time  and coordinates on
-dimensional spherical (), flat () or hyperbolic
() spaces, whose line elements are .
Since we are interested in time-dependent solutions, all the functions
appearing in the metrics as well as dilaton  are assumed to depend
only on the time . The Ricci tensors for the metric met  are
R_00  &=& - _[ u_+ (u_)^2 -u_u_0]
- k(B + B^2 - B u_0 ), R_  &=& e^2(u_[u_-u_u_0
+ _u_u_+ k B u_]_ , R_ab  &=&  e^2(B-u_0) [B + k B^2 -B u_0
+ _u_B] + (k-1)g_ab ,
where  is the metric for the hypersurface .
Here and in what follows, a dot denotes a derivative with
respect to .

For the field strengths, we take the most general ones consistent
with the field equations and Bianchi identities.
The value for an electrically charged S-brane (whose world-volume
is -dimensional) is given by
F_t _1 _q+1   = __1 _q+1   E, 3 
(n_A = q+2),
where  stand for the tangential direction to
the S-brane. The magnetic case is given by
F^_q+2  _p a_1 a_k   = 1 -g  
e^-a  ^t _q+2  _p a_1 a_k  E ,
3  (n_A = d-q-2)
where  denote the coordinates of the -dimensional
hypersurface .
The functions  and  are again assumed to depend only on .

The electric field () trivially satisfies the Bianchi
identities but the field equations are nontrivial. On the other hand, the
field equations are trivial but the Bianchi identities are nontrivial
for the magnetic field ().

We will solve the field eqs. () with the simplifying ansatz
- u_0 + _u_+ k B = 0,
which simplifies the field equations () considerably.
For both cases of electric () and magnetic ()
fields, we find that the field eqs. () are cast into
&& - u_0 + (u_0)^2 - _(u_)^2 - k B^2
= 1 2  ^2 + _A  d-q_A-3 2(d-2)  S_A (E_A )^2,


&& u_= - _A  _A^()  2(d-2)  S_A (E_A )^2,
3  (

&& B + (k-1) e^2u_0-2B  = _A  q_A+1 2(d-2) 
S_A (E_A )^2,


&& = _A  _A a_A 2  S_A (E_A )^2,


&& ( S_A E_A  )^. = 0,
where  denotes the kinds of -branes and we have defined
S_A ( _A a_A - 2 _q_A  u_),
and
_A^()  =   
.

and  corresponds to electric (magnetic) fields.
For magnetic case we have dropped the tilde from . Equations 1 ,
2  and 3  are the  and  components of the Einstein
equation in fe , respectively. The last one is the field equation for
the field strengths of the electric fields and/or Bianchi identity
for the magnetic ones. It is remarkable that both the electric and magnetic
cases can be treated simultaneously just by using the sign . This is
because the original system act  has the S-duality symmetry under
g_  g_ , F_n_A  e^-a_A  * F_n_A , - .
 From eq. () one finds
S_A E_A = c_A,
where  is a constant.
With the help of eq. const , we find that eqs. 2  and 4  give
u_&=& - _A  _A ^()  2(d-2)  c_A E_A + c_, &=& _A  _A a_A 2  c_A E_A + c_,
where  and  are integration constants.
Let us next define
g(t) = (u_0-B)/(k-1).
We find from ans 
B = g - 1 k-1 _u_, u_0 = kg - 1 k-1 _u_,
Using fint , we get
B = g + _A  q_A+1 2(d-2)  c_A E_A
- 1 k-1 _c_, 

u_0= k g + _A  q_A+1 2(d-2)  c_A E_A
- 1 k-1 _c_,
Substituting const  and bdot  into 3 , we obtain
g + (k-1) e^2(k-1)g  = 0,
which yields
g^2 + e^2(k-1)g  = ^2,
where  is an integration constant. The solution to eq. gdot  is
given by
g(t) =  
.
where  is another integration constant.

Substituting eqs. (), gddot  and gdot  into
() yields
&& (k-1) ( _A  q_A+1 2(d-2)  c_A E_A
- 1 k-1 _c_)^2
+ _( _A  _A ^()  2(d-2)  c_A E_A
- c_)^2 && +  ( _A  _A a_A 2  c_A E_A + c_)^2
+ _A  c_A 2  E_A - k(k-1) ^2 =0.
This equation must be valid for arbitrary functions  of .
 From the -independent part of eq. (), one finds
1 k-1 (_c_)^2
+ _c_^2 + c_^2= k(k-1) ^2.
We can then rewrite eq. () as
_A,B  [ M_AB  c_A 2  - _AB  
( 1 E_A )^. + 2c_A E_A  ]
c_B 2  E_A E_B =0,
where
M_AB  &=& __A ^() _B ^()  (d-2)^2 
+ (k-1) (q_A+1)(q_B+1) (d-2)^2  + _A a_A _B a_B, 

c_A &=& _q_A  c_1 2  c__A a_A.
Since  is constant, eq. () cannot be satisfied for
arbitrary functions  of  unless the second term inside
the square bracket is a constant. Requiring this to be a constant tells
us that the function  must satisfy
(1 E_A )^. + 2c_A E_A  = c_A N_A,
or
E_A = e^c_A(t-t_A)  N_A c_A(t-t_A) ,
where  is a normalization factor and  is an integration constant.
In this way, the problem reduces to the algebraic equation ()
supplemented by () without making any assumption other than
().

Equation () has two implications if we take
independent functions for the fields . In this case,
first putting  in eq. (), we learn that
c_A = 2(d-2)c_A N_A _A ,
where
_A = (q_A + 1) (d-q_A-3) + a_A^2 (d-2).
By use of eqs. har1  and cond2 , eqs. fint , bdot  and u0dot 
can be integrated with the results
u_0 &=& kg(t) + _A  q_A+1 _A  c_A(t-t_A)
+c_0 t + c_0', u_&=& - _A  _A ^()  _A  c_A(t-t_A)
+ c_t + c_B &=& g(t) + _A  q_A+1 _A  c_A(t-t_A)
+ c_0 t +c_0', &=& _A  (d-2)_A a_A _A  c_A(t-t_A)
+c_t + c_where 's are new integration constants and
&& c_0 = _A q_A+1 _A c_A
-_c_ k-1 , 
c_0' = -_c_k-1 , 
c_= c_- _A _A ^()  _A c_A, && c_= c_+ _A (d-2)_A a_A _A c_A.
To fix the normalization , we go back to eq. ().
Using (), we find
S_A = [c_A(t-t_A)]^2 e^_Aa_A c_q_A  c_which, together with () and (), leads to
N_A = _A 2(d-2)  
e^_Aa_A c_q_A  c_Our metric and other fields are thus finally given by
ds_d^2 &=& _A [c_A (t-t_A)]^2 q_A+1 _A  
[ e^2kg(t)+2c_0 t+2c_0'   - dt^2
+ e^-2(k-1)g(t) d_k, ^2 && 20  + _p  _A [c_A(t-t_A)]^- 2
_A^()  _A   e^2 c_t+2c_dy_^2], E_A &=& e^c_A(t-t_A)  N_A c_A(t-t_A) ,c_A = _q_A  c_1 2  c__A a_A.
where we have defined
_A^()  =   
.

These solutions contain  integration constants 
, and  and  with 
determined by eq. condconst . Among these,  can
be removed by rescaling the coordinates, and  by a shift of the time.
Without any preference of the choice of other paremeters, we leave
these as free parameters. Thus the general solutions can be constructed by
the following rules:
(1) All the directions are multiplied by 
, and in addition,
(2) the overall transverse direction (time and -dimensional space) has
the form  up to
the rescaling of the coordinates,
(3) the coordinates belonging to the brane are multiplied by
.
When these are specified to  supergravity and the integration
constants are chosen appropriately, these give the superposition
rules discussed in ref. .

The solution given in ref.  is reproduced if we restrict these to
a single S-brane and choose the integration constants as
&& c_= - a   c_1, (p); 
c_=-p q-1 (a  c_1), (p+q-k);&& c_= d-2 q-1 a + 2p  c_1; 
c_= 1  ((d-2)^2 (q-1)b^2  - ac_2),
(p) ; && c_0' = c_b' = c_= -p (q-1) ((d-2)^2 
(q-1)b^2  - ac_2), (p+q-k),
with  and .(
Here  and  on the rhs are those used in ref.  and
should not be confused with our .) 
Equation condconst  reduces to
pc_1^2   + (d-2)^2 2(q-1) -k(k-1)^2=0,
and the normalization is determined to be
N_A=(q-1)b 2(d-2) ,
in complete agreement with ref. .

The second condition following from eqs. () is  for
. This leads to the intersection rules for two branes:
If -brane and -brane intersect over 
dimensions, this gives
q  = (q_A+1)(q_B+1) d-2 -1 - _A a_A _B a_B.
Remember that the world-volume of -branes lies in -dimensional
space and not in time. For eleven-dimensional supergravity, we have electric
S2-branes, magnetic S5-branes and no dilaton . The rule int 
tells us that S2-brane can intersect with S2-brane over a '0-brane'
 (which actually lives in 1-dimensional space) and with S5-brane
over a 'string'  (2-dimensional space), and S5-brane can intersect
with S5-brane over '3-brane'  (4-dimensional space), again
in agreement with refs. . In particular, our results show that
there is no other intersecting solution as long as we treat the functions
 with different index  as independent. If this condition is
relaxed, there may be other solutions.

For all the spacelike D-brane solutions in type II superstrings, we find
a =3-q 2 ,
which tells us that the intersection rule is
q = q_A+q_B 2 -2.
These solutions do not preserve any supersymmetry. In fact, they are
supposed to correspond to branes with Dirichlet boundary conditions in
the time direction, and hence describe configurations which exist
only for a fixed time. These also contain singularity somewhere in time.
Closer examination of their properties would be quite interesting.

We note that our derivation is a simple generalization of the general
method developed in ref. . It is quite satisfying to see
that this is so useful method. There are also an important class of
time-dependent solutions called null-branes , which preserve
supersymmetry. It would be also interesting to apply our method to
these solutions.

To summarize, we have given quite a general model-independent derivation
of the superposition rules in arbitrary dimensions.
The intersection rules simply follow from the field equations if we require
that the functions  with different index  be independent.
In all cases, the algebraic eq. () (together with ())
must be satisfied, and this equation should be most useful to examine
possible solutions.
We hope to discuss various properties of these solutions using the hints
from dualities implied by underlying string dynamics elsewhere.
