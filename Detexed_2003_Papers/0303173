 We propose a Matrix Theory approach to 
Romans' massive Type IIA supergravity. It is obtained 
by applying the procedure of Matrix Theory compactifications 
to Hull's proposal  of the Massive Type IIA 
String Theory as M-Theory on a twisted  torus. 
The resulting Matrix Theory is a super-Yang Mills theory 
on large  three-branes with a space dependent non-commutativity 
parameter, which is also independently derived by a T-duality approach. We give evidence showing that 
the energies of a class of physical excitations 
of the super-Yang Mills theory show the correct 
symmetry expected from Massive Type IIA string theory 
in a lightcone quantization. 



 


Introduction 

Sometime ago Romans found a massive deformation of
ten-dimensional Type IIA supergravity. This ten-dimensional theory
has remained something of a mystery from the string theory viewpoint.
Polchinski argued this supergravity theory should lift to a massive Type IIA
string theory, corresponding to ordinary Type IIA string theory in the
background of a constant 10-form Ramond-Ramond field strength.

The problem of lifting this theory into M-theory has been considered by
a number of authors, including Hull. His proposal is
similar in spirit to the idea of of obtaining
ten-dimensional Type IIB by compactifying M-theory on a 2-torus of
vanishing size but fixed complex structure. Instead one considers
M-theory compactified on a 2-torus bundle over , , and
takes the limit of zero size. We review this construction in detail in
section 2.

We propose a nonperturbative formulation of M-theory in this
background using Matrix theory techniques. In section 3 we generalize
the construction of Seiberg and Sen, 
which provides us with a formulation of the discretized
light-cone quantization (DLCQ) of M-theory on the twisted torus.
The end result is a decoupled system of D3-branes in a background
 field, which we represent as a noncommutative Yang-Mills
theory with 8 linearly realized supercharges. An important novel
feature of our construction is the space dependent noncommutativity
parameter .

In section 4, we construct the noncommutative Yang-Mills degrees of
freedom directly by compactifying an infinite system of D0-branes on
the twisted torus, following the general Matrix theory
 procedure of
. Since we do not have 
the full zero-brane action in the original curved background 
we cannot proceed to derive the super-Yang-Mills theory as 
in the commutative case or the case with constant . 
Nevertheless we obtain some useful information about the 
nature of fields in the theory. Concretely we give a 
construction of the covariant derivatives acting on an appropriate 
space of fields, and obeying the compactification constraints 
of the twisted torus. 

In section 5, we take advantage of known results 
about the star products in the presence of space-dependent 
non-commutativity and the result of section 3 
concerning the emergence of space dependent non-commutative Yang-Mills
in a generalized Sen-Seiberg limit in order to elaborate on the 
form of the action.  

The spectrum of states for a D8-brane background of massive Type IIA 
is examined in section 6 and we provide
evidence for an  invariant spectrum of states, as
expected for DLCQ string theory in this background. This provides
further evidence supporting the Matrix formulation of the DLCQ string
theory.
In section 7 we consider a holographic dual spacetime to the
noncommutative gauge theory, generalizing, and we end with
conclusions and discussion in section 8. We comment 
on the extension of these Matrix compactification methods 
to other massive reductions of M Theory which admit de Sitter space 
solutions. 




Review of Hull's duality 

It is unknown how to lift the massive Type IIA string theory
 and its 
D8 background 
solution directly into M theory. While  M theory does not
seem to admit a cosmological constant,  a direct lifting of Romans'
massive ten-dimensional supergravity would  yield
 an eleven-dimensional cosmological constant. 
One possible way around this is to obtain 
 the ten-dimensional mass  via a generalized
Scherk-Schwarz  reduction on a circle. 
The standard implementation of such a reduction requires 
a global symmetry in eleven dimensions. 
The action of the eleven dimensional supergravity 
 does not have such a symmetry but the equations of 
 motion do have a scaling symmetry,
which was exploited in to reduce to a massive
ten-dimensional supergravity.
However, one obtains not Romans' massive supergravity but  a different
supergravity in ten dimensions.
 That massive supergravity can also be obtained as a 
usual reduction of a modified M theory.


Hull was able to embed the massive supergravity 
 and the D8 background in M theory by introducing 
two extra T dualities, one of which is a
"massive T duality" as defined in. 
Let us describe this  in detail.
Scherk-Schwarz reduction is a mechanism for generating masses by
compactification in the presence of a global symmetry 
, by an ansatz
(x^ , y) =g_y((x^ )) .
For the simplest case, of a  invariance, we can write
, and obtain a mass  for
. 

In it was shown that the Scherk-Schwarz reduction of 10d
IIB supergravity, using a  subgroup of the  global
invariance is T dual to massive IIA supergravity, using a modified set 
of "massive T duality" rules. The reduction is given by
g(y)=
 
which implies
(x,y)a +i e^-  =(x) +my R  .
The monodromy (obtained for ) must be a symmetry of the full
quantum theory, that is it must be an element of , which 
implies that  must be an integer. Then this compactification is
mapped by massive T duality into the usual compactification of the
massive IIA supergravity in ten dimensions. 

On the other hand, a Type IIB compactification on  with nontrivial 
 is equivalent to M theory compactified on a space  which is a 
 bundle over , where the  has modulus 
fixed and area . Equivalently, it is an F theory
compactification on  where  is fixed. 

We consider ten-dimensional massive Type IIA string theory, so the
 T dual (Type IIA) radius must go to 
infinity, hence the IIB radius   goes to zero. 
If we also impose that , then massive IIA
supergravity is equivalent to M theory on the space , in the
limit . The metric is (renaming  as
 and  as )
ds_B^2= R_3^2 (dx_3)^2 +A Im  () dx_1 +(x_3)dx_2^2
=R_3^2 (dx_3)^2 + R_2^2(dx_2)^2 + R_1^2(dx_1+ m x_3 dx_2)^2
with all the radii going to zero, and the  with periodicity 1, 
.
 In the limit, we should keep the massive IIA quantities 
fixed, so 
g_s^A=l_s Im (_0)R_3 =R_1 l_s R_2 R_3 = fixed ,
 l_s =l_P^3/2  R_1^1/2  =fixed ,
m  fixed. 
A comment is in order regarding the quantization of the 10d IIA mass 
and the massive T duality. 
The relevant terms in the string frame supergravity actions are, 
for IIA 
S_IIA =1 k_10 ^2  g (e^-2 R+M ^2)
+...=1 k^2 g  (e^-2(+(g_s^A)^2M ^2)+...
whereas on the IIB side we have, similarly 
S_IIB =1 k^2 g  (e^-2((_  a)^2)+...
 is quantized in units of , and it remains so when 
we reduce to 9d, whereas on the IIB side, , so 
the string frame masses are indeed equal
 m_(9) ^AM=g_s^AM =g_s^A m l_s = m
  g_s^B R_3 = m_(9) ^B
When talking about a duality, we have to specify the background as
well. The question is nontrivial, as the massive supergravity does not
admit a Minkowski background, not even a maximally supersymmetric
one. It does admit a half supersymmetric background, namely the D8
brane solution. 

The D8 has the string metric and dilaton ( is the
-dimensional Minkowski metric)
ds^2&=& H^-1/2  (d_8,1 ^2) + H^1/2  dx^2 

e^ &=& H^-5/4  

H&=& c+M  x=c+m l_s x
where  is an arbitrary constant of integration or (by the usual 
rescaling for p-branes)
ds^2&=& H ^-1/2 (d _8,1 ^2)+H ^1/2  dx ^2


e^ &=& e^_0 H ^-5/4 =g_s H ^-5/4 


H &=&H/c= 1+ g_s M  x  =1+ g_s m l_s x 
where  is defined as the coupling constant at the position of the 
D8 brane.
The solution is obtained by promoting  to a field
 and dualizing it to a 10-form field strength 

. Then 
, so the mass is piecewise constant, and jumps at
the positions of the D8 branes. The  in the mass corresponds to
D8 branes vs. anti-D8 branes (since  is the field
strength for D8's), so for a D8 the supergravity mass jumps by a
positive amount, whereas for an anti-D8 by a negative amount. Note 
though that the tension of both is positive (the metric is the same
for both). 

On a compact space we should 
 think of  the D8's as being part of a D8-O8 system, 
with 16 D8's canceling the charge of the orientifold 8-plane O8. 
 If the transverse space is noncompact we can
assume that the O8 and the rest of the D8's
are far away, and concentrate on the local physics of 
 single, or coincident D8's.

We now have to find the M theory dual of the D8
solution. Dimensionally reducing to eight dimensions, one finds a 6-brane solution
(domain wall), which can be oxidized on the space  to the
Ricci-flat M
theory background 
ds^2= H^1/2 (H^-1/2  d ^2_6,1  +H^1/2  dx^2) +ds_B^2
=d ^2_6,1  +H dx^2 +ds_B^2
where the moduli parameters of  are 
R_3= H^1/2 , =m x_3 +iH .
Equivalently, introducing the constants , we define
R_1= r_1/H ,  R_2= r_2 H ,  R_3=r_3 H ,
and the limit becomes  with
r_1 l_s r_2r_3 = fixed,  and   l_s fixed. 
Counting parameters, we find 5 parameters in the M-theory
compactification, ,  and . This limit sends 2 parameters
to zero (e.g.  then ), 
so that we are left with the 3 parameters of massive IIA,
,  and . 



Matrix theory description in D8 background and T duality approach 



Hull's prescription tells us how to relate massive IIA string
theory to M theory. In this section we construct a Matrix description
of the M-theory compactified on .

The problem is nontrivial for two reasons. The first is that the space 
is curved, and moreover, if we write
ds^2= (dz_3)^2+(dz_1+z_3 dz_2)^2 +(dz_2)^2
we find the Ricci tensor components
(We have
  and , and 

&&_12 ^3=- 2  
 _13 ^1=-^2z_3 2 
_23 ^1= 2 (1-^2(z_3)^2)

&&_22 ^3 =-^2 z_3 _13 ^2=  2  
_23 ^2=^2 z_3 2 
and all the rest are zero. Then we use
R_ab =_c ^c_ab  -1 2  _a_b ln
g + 1 2   ^c_ab _c ln g -^c_ad ^d_cb 
and the fact that . ) 
R_11   =^2 2  &&
R_12  = ^3 z_3 2  

R_22  = -^2 2 (1
-^2(z_3)^2) && R_33  = -^2 2   .
The curvature scalar is 
R=-^2 2  .
The metric () is invariant under the following isometries
T_1:&& z_1z_1+a_1, z_2z_2, z_3z_3

T_2:&&z_2z_2+a_2, z_1z_1, z_3z_3

T_3:&&z_3z_3+a_3, z_1z_1-z_2a_3, 
z_2z_2
with Killing vectors ,  and 
. We also note that .
By identifying under the isometries with  we obtain the space
, and then we have (since )
mR_1 R_2 R_3  =M .
We note therefore that we can trust supergravity as long as 
l_P=mR_1l_P R_2R_3  1
which is true in our limit ( fixed,
). 









In the following we choose to work with the D8 background,
corresponding to the M theory metric () with radii
(). We propose a Matrix description is obtained by
considering the action of  D0-branes in the D8 background
(). Since the radii of  go to zero, we have to make T dualities
in the 3 directions of , and so the Matrix model describing massive
IIA will be the action of  D3 branes in the T dual background.
It is understood that the general procedure used 
to obtain the dual Matrix model will be the same for any massive IIA 
background with a light-like symmetry.


First, however, we must define correctly the limit taken on the M
theory, and see what kind of limit we obtain for the D3 brane. This 
is described in detail in the appendix, but we will give here only the 
relevant facts. 
Sen and Seiberg give a prescription for 
the discretized light-cone quantization (DLCQ) of M theory (with light-like radius R and finite ) 
on a torus of finite radii . One goes to an equivalent  
theory with  and spacelike 11th direction of 
radius  and compactification radii
 such that 
R_s l _P^2 =R l_P^2 ,
R _i l _P  =R_i l_P 
are held fixed in the  limit. Then one makes T
dualities in the compact directions and gets a decoupled theory of 
Dp-branes (D3 in our case) with finite  and dual radii
R _i &=& l _s^2 R _i =l_P^3 R_iR 


g ^2_YM &=& g _s=R^3 l_P^6 _iR _i .
As we can see, the parameters of the dual D3 matrix model do not depend on 
the parameters of the  theory, which was introduced just to 
prove the duality. Therefore we can apply another limit to this
construction (independent of the Sen-Seiberg 
limit), namely  and , with
 and  kept fixed. We also need to 
make a "9-11 flip", namely to reinterpret the lightcone coordinate 
as the 11th direction (since in the M theory construction of massive
IIA  takes the role of 11th coordinate).

The parameters of the  are
R _1 =l_s^2 R ,  R _2 =R_1 R_2 R _1, 
R _3=R_1 R_3 R _1,  g _s=g _YM ^2
=l_sg_s^A R_1 
and the inverse relations are, if ,
&& R=Nl_s ,  R_1 = N g_YM  R _2R _3  

 && g_s^A
=g _YM ^2R _2R _3 R _1^2 
 , l_s = N R _1 .
In order to still have decoupling of the string theory from the D3
brane theory, we need to have  and the S-dual string length , 
which is satisfied in the  theory, since
l _s^2=l_P^3 R l _P l_P  
g _sl _s^2=l_s^3 g_s^A R l _P l_P 0 .
Let us now follow this procedure in order to find the Matrix model 
description of the background (): 9-11 flip, going to 
 theory, dimensional reduction to string theory, followed by 3
T dualities. The string theory background in the  theory is
ds^2= d ^2_5,1  +H dx^2 +ds_B^2
with the radii given in () and constant dilaton , 
and now we need to perform 3 T dualities. We will concentrate on the 
space , with metric
ds_B^2= H (r_3^2dx_3^2 +r_2^2dx_2^2) +r_1^2 H (dx_1 + mx_3
dx_2)^2
and work  with string metrics, on which 
the T dualities act in a simple way. We will work in units of
. If we want to restore the  
dependence we can formally put 
. 

The Buscher T duality rules are
g _00 &=&1 g_00  

g _0i &=& B_0i  g_00  

g _ij &=& g_ij -g_0i g_0j -B_0i B_0j  g_00  
  

B _0i & =& g_0i  g_00  

B _ij & =& B_ij + g_0i B_0j -B_0i g_0j  g_00  


 &=& 1 2  (g_00 )
Here the coordinate 0 of the T duality is defined such that
 is the Killing vector of an isometry.
It is worth noting here that one might be worried that we have to use
the massive T duality rules at some point, however the -dependent
terms are only in the transformation rules of the RR fields (see 
). 

As  we saw, we have 3 isometries, .   and 
 do not commute, so the  order of  T
dualities matters. We will choose to do , then , then . 
We begin by considering the simpler case of T dualities on the twisted
torus with 
the radii and , 
 set to  corresponding to the core of the D8 background ,
and later we will generalize this to the complete background. 
After  we have  : 
ds^2&=& (  dx_3^2 +  dx_2^2 
+ dx_1^2)

B_12 &=& m x_3 H_123 =m 

e^ &=& e^_0  .
After  we have 
ds^2 &=& ( dx_3^2 + dx_1^2) + (dx_2 + m
x_3 dx_1)^2 

e^ &=& e^_0   .
 
 is generated by the vector 
. Transforming to coordinates 
x_3'=x_3, x_2'=x_2 + m x_1x_3
implies 
so that we can apply the usual T duality rules.

The metric in the new coordinates (after dropping primes on 
coordinates) 
ds^2 &=& ( dx_3^2 + dx_1^2) + (dx_2  - m
x_1 dx_3  )^2 

e^ &=& e^_0   .
 
After the third -duality, we have 
ds^2 &=& dx_1^2  +  (dx_2^2
  + dx_3^2  )  1 + m^2 x_1^2      

B_23 dx^2 dx^3&=& - m x_1 1+ m^2 x_1^2   dx_2 dx_3
 

e^  &=& e^_0   (1+ m^2 x_1^2 )^1/2   .
The open string metric and -field 
are 

ds^2 &=& dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 +dx_3^2 

^23  &=& m x^1  .
 
The closed string metric in () is no longer periodic 
in . The metric in ()  has the property 
that the  torus at  is related to 
that at  by an  transformation 

 A  =   .
This  matrix is embedded 
in the full  T-duality 
group as 

 S  =   .
as explained for example in the review .  

The closed string metric and B-field 
in () obey the property that the 
background matrix  of the 
 torus and the dilaton are related 
E ( x_1 +1 ) =   a E(x_1) + b    cE(x_1) + d   

e^( x_1 + 1 )   = e^( x_1 )   
( det   g(x_1 + 1 )  det   g( x_1)  )^1/4   
  

where  are  
matrices entering a  
 matrix 
M &=&    .

One easily checks () when  
and with a little more work for general . 
The  are calculated by 
observing that the 
shift by  in ()  can be accomplished by 
first T-dualizing to (), doing the shift 
and T-dualizing back. 
The  matrix  for the T-duality
along  in () is 
T_3 &=&  

and . This gives 
a &= &   

b &= &     

c &= &  

d &= &   .


It is also interesting to observe that the 
open string background in () transforms
under a shift of  by the same  
matrix  when we use the action of 
given by Seiberg-Witten : 

G(x_1 + 1 ) &=& G(x_1) = ( a + b (x_1)  ) G( x_1)  
( a + b (x_1)  )^T   

( x_1 + 1 )   &=&  ( c + d (x_1) ) ( a + b )^-1  


g_YM  (x_1 +1) &=&  
 =g_YM  (x_1) ( det  ( a +  b ) )^1 4    
 
 
The final background is to be viewed as 
a  bundle over  where the 
 is twisted by an element of the full 
-duality group of the torus upon transport along the . 
This structure of  the closed string background obtained 
after T-dualizing the twisted torus has been observed recently 
in and related work appears 
in.

We now describe the T-dualities on the full background. 
The above remarks on the  carry over. 
After T duality on  we have (the full 10d metric) 
ds^2&=&  d ^2_5,1  +H(dx^2 +r_3^2 dx_3^2 +r_2^2 dx_2^2 
+1/r_1^2 dx_1^2)

B_12 &=& m x_3 H_123 =m 

e^ &=& e^_0  r_1  H 
which we recognize as nothing but the NS5 brane metric smeared over 
the transverse directions 1,2,3. 

After T duality on  we have 
ds^2 &=& H(r_3^2dx_3^2 +1/r_1^2 dx_1^2) +1 r_2^2 H (dx_2 + m
x_3 dx_1)^2 

e^ &=& e^_0  r_1r_2 
which is the same metric as we started from, with inverted radii 
 and with 1 and 2 interchanged. 

Then in these dual coordinates,  has Killing vector
. Applying the coordinate
transformation () 
 and  T duality we get
(restoring also the  dependence for later use) 
ds^2 &=& l_s^4 (H (dx_1^2/r_1^2) + H^-1  (dx_2^2/r_2^2
  +dx_3^2/r_3^2)  1+  ( m l_s^2  x_1 H r_2 r_3 )^2 )

B_23 dx^2 dx^3&=& -l_s^4m r_1 r_2r_3H^2 x_1/r_1 
1+ ( m l_s^2  x_1 H r_2 r_3 )^2   dx_2/r_2 dx_3
/r_3 

e^  &=&  l_s^3e^_0   r_1r_2r_3  H^-1/2  
(1+( m l_s^2  x_1 H r_2 r_3 )^2
)^-1/2  .
Let us now define  and calculate open 
string variables, to find the metric  and noncommutativity
parameter  the D3-brane sees. 
Using
(G+ l_s^2 )^ij =(1 g+l_s^2B )^ij 
we get  for the full 10d metric
ds^2 &=& d^2_5,1  + H(dx^2 + dy _1^2) +d
y _2^2 +dy _3^2 H  

e^ &=& l_s^3e^_0  r_1r_2r_3 H  

[ y _2, y _3 ] &=&-i (m
r_1 r_2r_3 )l_s^2
y _1= -i y _1

H&=&1+ m r_1 r_2 r_3 x= 1+ m r_1 l_s^2 r_2 r_3  X
=1+  X ,
where we have defined .
 
Recalling that 
 goes to zero in the infinite boost limit, and then, with 
 and  fixed, we have  
l_s ^2^1/2 ,  g_ij  
l_s ^4,
 G_ij  g_ij   l_s ^4 =fixed  

which is nothing other than the Seiberg-Witten limit for
noncommutative geometry, which means that the theory on the D3 branes 
is nothing other than noncommutative super Yang-Mills theory with
variables (metric, dilaton and noncommutativity) given in
(). 
The noncommutativity 
parameter is
 =m r _1 l _s^2 r _2r _3 
=m r_1 r_2r_3 l_P^3 R =
mg_s^A l_s^A l_P^3 R  =mR _2R _3
 R _1  .
 Space-dependent non-commutativity and solution of 
 Matrix Theory constraints   

Let us now see that the  defined on () can also be 
obtained from an algebraic approach in Matrix theory. Our goal will be
to reproduce the noncommutative structure of the Matrix degrees of
freedom . We follow the general procedure for 
compactification. We need to find T-dual 
variables  such that the matrices  can be represented as
covariant derivatives. For the simple case of circle compactification, 
one represents the algebra
X ^-1 =X +R by , since 
. 

Let us review this in a bit more detail. We start 
with a finite number  of zero branes on a circle. 
This is equivalent to having an infinite number of copies 
of  zero branes along a line, with zero branes 
separated  by a constant  periodic shift   related by 
a gauge transformation  in  as in
(). 
One writes   matrices as   
where  run over the  zero branes
and  are integers. 
These matrices are now operators on states labeled by 
an integer  
corresponding to , tensored by finite 
 matrices. The operators on the states  
can be viewed as the algebra of functions on 
 the T dual space. The form  , 
allows us to read off the T-dual radii. The matrix elements 
of  and  are given by 
  
 and  . 
So we have the T dual Matrix model description in terms of D1-branes
(and by generalization, Dp-branes). Fluctuations in the compact  are
mapped to fluctuations in the gauge field , and part of the
original 
Matrix degrees of freedom were 
 used to generate functions of  the worldvolume direction . 










We will now try and apply this procedure to our case. We will treat
first the case when the harmonic function , and will see later what 
complications H introduces. We can think of it as working in the near core
region . We will also put for simplicity  for the 
moment, and return to the general case later on.  

In our case we have 3 isometries, , which means that 
we need to impose constraints on the D0 Matrix model analog to
() and try to solve them in terms of a T dual space.
The constraints are
T_1:&& _1 X_1 _1^-1 =X_1+1


&&_1 X_2 _1^-1 =X_2

&& _1 X_3 _1^-1 =X_3
where  is a transformation acting on the X's which
corresponds to the isometry , and similarly
T_2:&& _2 X_1 _2^-1 =X_1


&&_2 X_2 _2^-1 =X_2+1

&& _2 X_3 _2^-1 =X_3 

T_3:&&_3 X_1_3^-1 = X_1-m X_2

&&_3 X_2 _3^-1 =X_2 

&&_3 X_3 _3^-1  =X_3 +1  . 
We noted that  and  don't commute, and we can see that 
therefore  and  don't commute. Namely, 
if we put , 
then we have 
M X_1 M^-1  &=& X_1 -m 
 
M X_2 M^-1  &=& X_2 

M X_3 M^-1  &=& X_3 .
 From the relations defining  and  we can see that we can put 
 and  just
as in flat space. The commutation of relation of  
with  can also be solved by  and 
 ( here  ). 
The relations () allow us to  solve for 
. Hence we deduce 
that  and  don't commute, and we get exactly the noncommutativity
relations 
[y_2, y_3]= i _23  =  iy_1,  [y_1, y_3]=[y_1, y_2]=0
as we obtained from the T duality approach of the last section. 


The relations () also imply nontrivial
commutations for derivatives and coordinates. Indeed, by
taking the commutator with various derivatives of the relations 
(), we get a set of equations for . We
will not list them here but just mention a  solution, namely
 as usual, but also 
. The relevant equation is obtained from 
[[_1, y_2], y_3]+[y_2, [_1, y_3]]=-iand we can see that it is indeed solved by 
. 



It is useful to observe that a 
change of variables maps the non-commutativity parameter 
to a constant. 
Indeed, in  the open string metric 
ds^2= dy_1^2 +dy_2^2 +dy_3^2+ds_tr ^2
with the noncommutativity  we can make the
change of variables , 
after which the theory has metric
ds^2=dy'_1 ^2 +dy'_3 ^2 +d(y'_1y'_2)^2
and constant noncommutativity . The closed string
metric and B field  in () become, under the transformation:
ds^2&=&
 dy'_1 ^2(1+y'_2 ^2 1+^2y'_1 ^2 )+dy'_3 ^2+y'_1 ^2
dy'_2 ^2+2y'_2y'_1dy'_2dy'_1 
1+^2y'_1 ^2 


l_s^4B&=& y'_1(y'_1dy'_2+y'_2dy'_1)dy'_3 1+^2y'_1 ^2  .
To put back the  and  dependence, we only need to substitute
 in the above. 




 Since the noncommutativity is constant in the new coordinates , 
 we can realize the  commutation relations
  [ y'_i, y'_j ] &=& i ij  

 [ y'_j ] &=& ^i _j   

  as we explain further below. 
The commutation relations () imply the
following relations for the unprimed coordinates
[ y_i, y_j ] &=& i _ij (y_1)  = 
 i ^ _ij (y_1)   

[_i, y_j ] &=& ^i_j + ^i_j()   


where  has nontrivial components 
,  has nontrivial components 
, 
as we wanted (see () and () ).
These guarantee 
that if we set  
and  we correctly obey the constraints
in ()()(). This provides the 
foundation for 
the  general solution including gauge fields but 
we first need to review the construction of the 
covariant derivatives including gauge fields in the case 
of constant non-commutativity.   



















We recall some facts about the construction of 
a  non-commutative gauge theory from 
covariant derivatives in the context of an ordinary 
constant noncommutativity . To have notation 
which agrees with our set-up we will let 
 run over  and we will let the non-commutative torus 
algebra be generated by . Consider compactification 
constraints generated by    
 and  
where 
, 
with the only non-trivial components being 
. The  and  are 
 represented in a Hilbert space where there is 
non-trivial commutant generated by 
 which have a 
non-commutativity parameter .
Writing  
and , we have 
. Explicit construction 
of  the  and 's or 
equivalently the 
and  in terms of coordinates  
which commute with each other and satisfy standard commutation 
relations with their derivatives 
 and together describe  a four-dimensional
 phase space are given in  ()
=  w_2 + i  w_3     

= w_3 - i  w_2        
 
=  w_2 - i  w_3    
 
= w_2 + i  w_2    .

 
These formulas can be used to check that
the correct mutual non-commutativity of  and of 
 are reproduced, as well as the vanishing 
commutators of any  with .  

We can define derivatives with respect to  and 
  

[  y_i^   , y_j^  ]=_i^j,  
[  y_i^    , y_j^  ]
=0
and 

[  y_i^   , y_j^  ]=
_i^j,  
 [  y_i^   , y_j^  ]
=0 .
These constraints can be solved by defining the derivatives 
in terms of appropriate commutator actions with elements 
in the algebra of  
 && y_i^   
=-i(^-1 )^ij  y_j^  , 

&& y _i^   
 = +i (^-1 )^ij  y _j^  
and the non-trivial commutation relations of derivatives follow
&& [  y_i^   ,     y_j^    ]
 =-i (^-1 )^ij  

 &&[  y_i^   ,       y_j^      ] 
 = + i(^-1 )^ij   .

The fact that the derivatives can be expressed in terms 
of commutator action with elements in the algebra plays 
an important role in  
in the context of a discussion of solutions of Matrix 
Theory describing extended objects in  and having 
a non-commutative worldvolume theory derived from Matrix Theory. 

The presence of the commutant generated by the  is 
important in getting solutions to the constraints with 
non-trivial gauge fields. The simplest gauge theories 
are in fact obtained when we take the covariant  
derivatives to be  
.
Such  a choice of derivative  was implicit
for example in.  It is useful to note that 

 [  y_i^     +  
 y_i^     , 
 y_j^    +  
 y_j^     ] = 0 
which means that there is no background magnetic field.
As far as solving the compactification constraints 
we could work with a more general set of partial 
derivatives  
. 
















We can now write a solution for the  operators
acting on a Hilbert space of functions. 
Since the periodicities are simple in the 
-coordinates, we are lead to consider
functions of generated by ,  and .
Recalling the discussion above, where we saw that 
the constraints are expressed in terms of  variables 
whereas the fields are functions of variables 
, we are lead to work with  the Hilbert 
space of functions of the form 

= _n_1, n_2, n_3  
 _n_1, n_2, n_3   e^i  n_1 y_1^       
e^i  n_2 y_1^  y_2^  
  e^i  n_3 y_3^      

where  are arbitrary integers. 
The  and ,
for  are constructed in 
terms of a four dimensional phase space as in 
(). 

On this Hilbert space we can write operators 

&& X_1 = i  y_1^    - i y_2^  
(  1 y_1^       y_2^   
  - i A_2 ( e^iy_1^    , e^ i   ,  
e^ i   ))  -   i      
 + A_1  ( e^iy_1^    , e^ i   ,  e^ i   )


&& X_2 = i      + 
A_2 ( e^iy_1^    , e^ i   ,  e^ i   ) 


&& X_3 = i    + 
A_3 ( e^iy_1^    , e^ i   ,  e^ i   )


&&^a = ^a (  e^iy_1^    , e^ i   
,  e^ i   ) .


  
The constraints are generated by

 && _1 = e^ i y_1^    
  
 && _2 = e^ i y_1^  y_2^     
   
 && _3 = e^ i y_3^      .

 

With these expressions we can check that the constraints 
in (), () , () are satisfied and 
that the 's correctly act in the Hilbert space. 
We elaborate on some aspects of these properties.  
The combination  
 is
necessary in  because it allows  to be well defined 
on the Hilbert space. Consider for example 
 acting 
on . It gives 
 which does not belong to the Hilbert 
space we defined. The combination 

 
does map elements in the Hilbert space back to themselves. 
For similar reasons, the appearance of 

 
guarantees that the constraint 
is satisfied.  The appearance of  in  may seem surprising 
but is necessary to make sure that 
the conjugation of  by  does correctly 
reproduce the shift  in ().  It is also worth noting 
that the change of variables to  coordinates 
is a useful guide in constructing the solution but 
the periodicity conditions are not simple in these coordinates. 
A consequence is that what we might call the gauge 
fields in the primed coordinates, deduced from those 
in the unprimed coordinates are not good operators 
that act in the Hilbert space. For example 
 acting 
on the Hilbert space gives functions of the form 
 which do not belong to the Hilbert 
space. Finally while the above is a relatively simple 
solution including gauge fields, it is not the most general. Just as
in the commutative case, we can also consider -vectors 
acted on by the above operators.
By analogy to the commutative case 
 or the case of constant  , 
where the appropriate Hilbert spaces could be generalized to include 
magnetic fluxes we expect similar generalizations here. 

Let us see what happens now in the presence of the harmonic function
 (), and let us restore also the  factors. 
The isometries of the metric continue to be the same,  does not
affect the identifications, so we can 
write down the same constraints as before, where now  
correspond to the dimensionless coordinates . 
&&_1 X_1 _1^-1  =X_1 +1 

&&_2 X_2 _2^-1  =X_2 + 1 

&& _3 X_3 _3 ^-1  = X_3 +1 

&& _3 X_1 _3^-1  = X_1 -m X_2 
We have only written  the nontrivial relations above.
These have solutions described above. If we rescale 
 and correspondingly  for 
the dual variables, then ,
, 
and one obtains 
[y _2, y _3]
= im l_s^2 r_1 r_2 r_3 , y _1= i y _1,
 [y _1, y _3]=[y _1, y _2]=0 .
We have thus  obtained the same noncommutativity as from the 
T duality approach (). 
Unfortunately, now there is no independent way to verify the open
string metric and dilaton, which are nontrivial in the presence of 
the harmonic function . 

Still, this fact gives us some useful information about other 
backgrounds. We notice that the 
constraints were not modified by the presence of the D8-brane
background (i.e. by the nontrivial ). We can guess that for a general 
massive IIA background, the M theory lift will be again a "dressing"
of the same space  with the same identifications for the dimensionless
's, therefore the constraints () are unmodified.
So by the above procedure we will get a  on a space with the
same noncommutativity. Again  we will have a nontrivial
metric and dilaton as well as possible other RR fluxes, 
which will have to be derived from the T duality approach. 
The identifications in M theory and 
correspondingly the noncommutativity of the 
D3 brane space are of a topological nature, and so insensitive to local
modifications.


NCSYM action and stability 

In this section we describe the D3 brane action we are getting for the Matrix
model. First let us check that we can put D0
branes at  in the background () (and they are
stable). We will also check whether they can stay at nonzero  (in the 
D3 Matrix model, whether we can have a nonzero vev for ). 

A probe D0 brane in the background () will have the action
S_1D0 =  dt e^- 
 1+ g_ij (X ^i X ^j) 
The equations of motion of this action in the background ()
are
&&2r_3^2 d dt  [H X _3]=2r_1^2 mX _2 H^-1  (X _1
+ m X_3 X  _2)

&&2d dt  [H X ] = H' [(X ^2 +r_3^2 X ^2_3 +r_2^2 
X _2^2 ) -r_1^2 H^-1 (X _1 + mx_3 X _2)^2 ]

&& d dt  [H^-1  (X _1 +mX_3 X _2)] =0 

&& d dt  [ 2mX_3 H (X _1 + mX_3 X _2) + H
r_2^2 X _2] =0 .
It follows that if  and  small (so
that , then the only remaining equation is 
2 X  = -H'(X )^2
hence the static potential vanishes.


Let us compare this with what happens for the D0-D8 system. There we
have a 1-loop Chern-Simons term , which 
gives a potential for the D0's. One can calculate it in string theory 
 or directly from arguments about the supersymmetric quantum
mechanics. But one can understand it from charge
conservation. When a D0 passes through a D8 charge conservation
requires the creation of an elementary string (Hanany-Witten effect),
which will generate a linear potential. In its absence, the D0-D8 is not
supersymmetric and has a linear repulsive potential . 
Such a Chern-Simons term (and consequently the linear potential) are
absent in the geometric background we consider (). 
One can also see this from the D0 worldline
perspective. The CS term of the D0-D8 system 
appeared by integrating out the massive
 fermion, which is absent from our case. 

Now that we have established that we can have D0 branes at fixed 
(and correspondingly D3 branes in the T dual picture), we would like
to describe the action of these D branes in more detail.
The prescription of Myers 
for the (bosonic part of the) Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action in a 
general background is 
S_DBI &=& -T_p d^p+1  STr ( e^- 
 -det  ( P [ E_ab  +E_ai (Q^-1  -)^ij  E_jb ] +
F_ab  ) det  Q^i_j  )

Q^i_j &=& ^i_j +i[X^i, X^j] E_kj 

E_ &=& (g+B)_ij 

and a corresponding Chern-Simons piece. Here the fields are in closed string
variables and if the fields depend on the transverse scalars, the
prescription  is to write the fields as functions of the
adjoint-valued scalars and then take a completely symmetric trace over 
all adjoint indices. 

So the DBI action in our background () will be 
S=-T_3dt (_i=1 ^3 dx_i) STr  (e^-( X ^mn , x_1)  
 -det  (g_ab  ( X ^mn , x_1)  +B_ab ( X ^mn , x_1) 
+F_ab )  ) .
If we assume that the Seiberg-Witten map continues to hold in the 
presence of the nontrivial  (which is not entirely 
obvious, but should probably be true in a Taylor expansion 
for small values of ), then we get 
S=-T_3 dt (_i=1 ^3 dx_i) STr  (e^- (X ^mn ) 
-det  (G_ab (X ^mn )+ F _ab  )  )
where  is the noncommutative field strength. 



Moreover, we saw that the Sen-Seiberg procedure implied that we 
take the Seiberg-Witten limit for noncommutative geometry on the 
D3 action, so we are left with noncommutative  with -dependent 
metric and dilaton. 

The D8 brane had 16 supersymmetries, and correspondingly the M theory 
background had also 16 supersymmetries, which means that the D3 brane
action (noncommutative ) will have 8 linearly realized supersymmetries. The 
fermionic field content is the same as for the flat D3 brane, 
but half the supersymmetries are broken by the nonzero  and 
the nontrivial noncommutativity.

In the near horizon region (at ), the D8 background is flat,
so it has 32 supersymmetries. Correspondingly, the DBI action has 
16 supersymmetries if we put  and  constant (and keep
only the noncommutativity), as in the  constant case. 

Let us now examine the star product, since it is nontrivial
(space-dependent). For constant noncommutativity, the noncommutativity 
of the space can be traded for a modified product, the star product,
fg= e^i^ij  _i _j' f(x) g(x')_x=x' 
but when  is space-time dependent, we have to be more careful.

The first observation we can make is that our  satisfies
the associativity condition^il _l^jk +^jl _l^ki +
^kl _l^ij =0
and so we can define an associative star product. As an aside, 
we have a nonzero , yet the product is still associative.
This is possible because  is not invertible in the 
whole space , but just in 
 (if it would be, then associativity and zero H field would be the
 same, see). Associative star products in the case of 
space dependent  can be defined 
with the prescription  given by Kontsevich. 

The abstract formula is 
f g &=& _n ^n _G_n  w_   B_,
   (f,g)

w_ &=& 1 n! (2)^2n _H_n  _i=1 ^n
(d_e^1_k  d_e^2_k )
and where explicitly, derivatives which can act either on  and , or
on , are contracted with other 's. For example, up to
second order in  we have 
f g &=& fg + ^ij  _i f _j g
+^2  2  ^ij  ^kl  _i _k f 
_j l g 

&&+^2 3  (^ij _j^kl  )
(_i _k f _l g-_k f _i
_l g) +O (^3) .
But in our case we have not only the associativity condition
() but also the more restrictive condition 
^ij _j ^kl =0
which implies that there will be no corrections (since derivatives on 
 will always appear in the above combination, as the only
object with contravariant indices is ). Then the Kontsevich
product will be the same as the usual star product, a fact which 
is obvious  in the expanded 
form. The exponential form will also be the same, and we therefore have
fg = e^i^ij  (x) _i _j' f(x) g(x')
_x=x'   = e^i ^ij (x') _i _j '  f(x) g(x')_x=x'  .
As we saw, we can change coordinates by , and
then , but then the metric is not 
flat anymore. We can however obtain a third form for the star
product. Since in these new coordinates the product is
f g= e^i' ^ij _x'_i _y'_j  f(x')
g(y')_x'=y' 
by going back to unprimed coordinates we get 
f g= e^i' ^ij x^m x' ^i 
y^n y' ^j _x_m _y_n  
f(x) g(y)_x=y  .
As this point it is interesting to observe the similarity of our 
noncommutative theory to the one described by Hashimoto and Sethi 
in. Moreover, if we take a Penrose-like  limit (infinite
boost, while taking a relevant mass parameter to zero) we obtain 
"half" their solution. Indeed, 
take an infinite boost in the  direction,
and also take  to zero as
x_1e^  2 (x_1 '+t')=e^  2 x' ^+
,  =e^-  2   '
and drop the primes. Then the open string variables ()
become the flat metric (and constant string
coupling), with  (notice that  in this 
limit, since ). Their solution has also 
. In these coordinates (with spacetime dependent
noncommutativity), their closed string variables (metric, B field
and dilaton) are 
ds^2&=& [-2dx^+dx^- +R^2(dx_2^2+dx_3^2) R^2+(x^+)^2 ]-
x_2^2(dx^+)^2 (x^+)^2 +2x_2x^+dx_2dx^+ R^2+(x^+)^2 

B&=&[Rx^+ dx_2dx_3 R^2+(x^+)^2 ]-Rx_2 dx^+  dx_3 R^2
+(x^+)^2 

e^ &=&g_sR^2 R^2+(x^+)^2  
where the terms in brackets correspond to  the "Penrose" limit of
our solution. In these coordinates, their open string metric is flat and
the open string dilaton constant, just as in our case. 
So we are obtaining "half" the solution in, which seems to 
suggest that both are part of a 1-parameter set of solutions. 

Another observation is that in  there is also a 
transformation of coordinates which makes  constant, namely
x^+&=& x' ^+

x_2&=& x_2'x' ^+

x^-&=& x' ^- +1 2  x' ^+x_2^2
whereas for the "Penrose" limit of our solution it is just
x^+=x' ^+ , 
x_2=x'_2x' ^+  .
However, in their case () is not satisfied, while
() is still satisfied, so in their case the Kontsevich 
product is different from the usual star product, even though there 
is a coordinate transformation which makes  constant. 

Finally we  note that an example of spacetime dependent
noncommutativity has been analyzed in, and the
Seiberg-Witten analysis still holds (even though  is varying).  


Spectrum of states 

Now we take a step toward deriving the duality between the 
noncommutative 
on () and massive IIA in the D8 background, by studying
the spectrum of BPS states. Type IIB string theory in ten dimensions
can be obtained by compactifying M-theory on a 2-torus of vanishing
area, but fixed complex structure.
In this case the 
Sethi-Susskind and Banks-Seiberg 
constructions gave evidence
for the duality. We will follow the Sethi-Susskind construction, which
is defined in 3+1 dimensions, setting it up so that 
we can go smoothly to our case. The IIB Matrix model is 2+1  which 
has naturally an  invariance, but the claim is that at strong
coupling it develops an  invariance (which is consistent with the 
supersymmetry algebra and is the maximal  symmetry). The easiest way to see it 
 is to go to 3+1d  and use
electric-magnetic duality. There we have only an  manifest
invariance (6 scalars), which will be enhanced to . 
In our case we naturally have 3+1d , so
it should be our starting point. In the massless case (), we still have
an  (6 scalars) enhanced to , but in the massive case we
have an  (the scalar  vev corresponding to the direction
transverse to the D8 brane in IIA - is special), which should be
enhanced to .

Let us then set up 3+1d  for our use. 
The  lives on a dual torus of lengths 
.
Sethi and Susskind have 
. The mass of a membrane on the shrinking torus 
 is identified via the M theory-IIB duality 
with the momentum mode on another direction  in IIB,
R_2R_3 l_P^3 =1 R_Y 
with the limit  to infinity, and we set . 
By the above formula, we see that 
 
(if  is the M theory direction), and so as we said 
 is the
extra transverse direction in the lightcone IIB theory which appears
when the M theory torus shrinks to zero size. To obtain 
invariance, we indeed need to choose , so that 
all the IIB lightcone coordinates,  have length
.   Then the 3+1d  coupling,
g _YM ^2 = l_P^3 R_1R_2R_3 =1
so we are at the self-dual point, and we have electric-magnetic
duality. As usual by the Sen-Seiberg procedure,  theory 
was introduced in order to show massive string degrees of freedom
decouple from the , but the T dual 
variables depend only on M theory quantities. 

The electric flux along  corresponds to the
momentum conjugate to  under T duality 
, and so it goes together with the other momenta to 
increase  to  invariance. Because of electric-magnetic
duality 
however,  becomes .

In our case, when the 3d space  in M theory  shrinks to zero size, 
we have 2 extra transverse lightcone coordinates appearing in type IIB,  
R_1R_2 l_P^3 =1 R_Y_2   and   
R_1R_3 l_P^3 =1 R_Y_3  
and so  invariance (in the massless case) 
should be recovered when  have the
same length, 
R_Y_2 =R_Y_3 =R_ 
For Sethi and Susskind, 
the magnetic flux  in the D2 theory (and correspondingly in 
the D3 theory as well) was T dual to wrapping number of membranes,
which by the M-IIB duality (and 9-11 flip) was identified with 
momentum on  (see ()). 
For our case, the invariance we seek is with the momentum in 
 and , which corresponds in the D0 theory 
 by () to wrapping number on 12 and 13 respectively. By T
 duality, in the D3 theory, this is magnetic flux  and
 . 

So let us see the  invariance in the 2 cases from the YM energy.   
The energy of magnetic fluxes and electric fluxes is deduced from 
&&dx^2 dx^3 tr  F_23  = n_m^23 

&& dx^2 dx^3 tr  F_01  =n_e^23  g_YM ^2 
(for magnetic flux on 23 and electric flux on 1) so that 
&& tr F_23 =n_m^23  R _2R _3 

&& tr F_01 =n_e^23  g_YM ^2 R _2R _3  .
If we add momentum modes on  (),
 the energy 
E=1 2g_YM ^2 dx^1 dx^2 dx^3 [tr F_0i ^2 +_j<k 
tr F_jk ^2 +
(_  X^i)^2 ]
becomes (using that 
 and concentrating on the U(1) piece)
N E &=& R _3 2R _1R _2 [ n_m12 ^2  
g _YM ^2  
+ n_e12 ^2 g _YM ^2 ] +R _1 2R _2R _3 
[ n_m23 ^2  g _YM ^2  
+ n_e23 ^2 g _YM ^2 ]+ 

&&R _2 2R _1R _3 [ 
n_m13 ^2  g _YM ^2  
+ n_e13 ^2 g _YM ^2 ]+  
( n_1 R _1 )^2 + ( n_2 R _2  )^2 
+ ( n_3 R _3  )^2   
This formula is also in accord with.
The elementary excitations of the theory are the momentum modes ,
but  the Matrix theory prescription tells us to look at the energy 
of excitations on the moduli space, in other words for excitations with
energy much smaller than that of momentum modes. 

In the Sethi-Susskind case (), 
the smallest elementary excitation (momentum mode) is 
of order  (), and
the 12 and 13 fluxes have energy much bigger than that, whereas  the
23 fluxes have much smaller energy, so they should be thought of as moduli.

In our case, (, ),
the smallest elementary excitation is of order , and
the 23 fluxes have energy much bigger than that. For the 12 and 13
fluxes, choosing  (as we have seen we need in 
()), the prefactor (energy scale) 
of the fluxes is also ,
as for the momentum modes. However, since  is infinite, the
electric fluxes have energy much larger than the momentum modes,
whereas the magnetic fluxes have energy much smaller than the momentum 
modes, so are real moduli. 

Now let us see what should we compare the energy of those moduli
against. The energy on the moduli space of the 6 scalar fields is 
N E=p _  ^2 2M_0 =n  ^2 
2R _ ^2M_0 =n  ^2 2M_0 R_ ^2 l_P^2 
l _P^2 
where we have put the transverse space in a box of size ,
to be equated with  as above, and  is the mass of 
those moduli, but we have taken into account that we are calculating
energies in the  theory.
 comes from the fact that we are really expanding the 
DBI action of the D3 in order to get ().  But then
M_0=V_pT_p =R _1R _2R _3 g _s
  l_s ^4  =1 g _s l _s  
NE=p _  ^2 2M_0 =  n  ^2g _s
  l _s 2R_ ^2
   l_P^2 l _P^2 =Rn  ^2 2R_ ^2 
Here  is the string length for the  theory. 
Then in the Sethi-Susskind case we have the energy of the moduli
(using ())
E= l_P^2 2N l _s g _s l _P^2 
 [n_m12 ^2 +n_e12 ^2 R _1^2 
+n  ^2 R_ ^2 ]
=R 2N [n_m12 ^2 +n_e12 ^2 R _1^2 
+n  ^2 R_ ^2 ]
which is  invariant if we put , and in our
case (with ) we get (using that 
 and ())
E= R 2N [n_m,13 ^2 R_Y_2 ^2 +n_m,12 ^2 
R_Y_3 ^2 +n  ^2 R_ ^2 ]
which is  invariant if we put . 
We notice that the formulas () and ()  are 
exactly what we expect from supergravity and from the BFSS model 
for the free supergravitons. Of course it would be more interesting 
to derive the interaction piece.

Finally, what happens in the massive case  (in the  sector, which
has still 16 supersymmetries)?  As we mentioned, one of
the scalars () corresponds to the direction transverse to the D8 brane,
so we have manifest  invariance of the scalars which should be
lifted to a  invariance, of the lightcone string theory in the 
D8 background. So the above formulas should apply to 5 of the scalars,
but not to the  direction.

The noncommutative   is obtained by replacing the usual product
with the star product. 
To first order in , the action (see, equation
4.27) is 
S&=&[ F_ij F_mn G^im G^jn (1-1/2 F_ij ^ij ) 
-2^kl F_ki  F_lj  F_mn G^im G^jn ]

&=& [F_ij ^2(1+3F_23 ^23 )]
and we see that if , the action is unmodified, and so the 
energy formula is unmodified as well, as expected. The higher order
terms will just contain terms with derivatives of , and so a constant 
 and  will still be a solution, and the energy formula
of the magnetic fluxes will again be unmodified. As for the momentum 
modes , 
they are modes on the moduli space, not in worldvolume, so
there is no reason for their energy to be modified. 
We can easily verify that there are no  corrections
to the energy in our case by applying the general formula in
 to the moduli space of our theory.

As for the action of the elementary strings, that is easy to
understand. In the Type IIB case, considered the limit of
small coupling, when 
, so Yang-Mills moduli space excitations occur only 
in the 3 direction. Then the string action is just the sigma model action on 
the moduli space, with worldvolume given by time and the 3 direction.
In our case, there is no need to take small coupling, since already
, and so 
Yang-Mills moduli space excitations already occur just in the
worldvolume 1 direction, and the string action is again the sigma model. 

What about the supergravity mass? Massive IIA supergravity
 has a massless graviton, a dilaton and an antisymmetric
tensor  which acquire a mass proportional to , a 
massless 3-form , and massive fermions (gravitino and spin 
1/2). The 1-form  is gauged away, since it appears in the 
combination . In the D8 brane background, one has
to study the wave equation for each field. The massless fields 
(graviton and ) can still have a constant wavefunction in the 
 direction (transverse to the D8), and then 
p^2=-2p^+p^-+p _ ^2=0
E=p^-=p _ ^2 2p^+ 
 (where  is the momentum along the D8)
which reproduces  (). A nontrivial wavefunction in the 
direction implies that , and correspondingly an extra term
in the energy. 

For one of the massive fields, we have to study the wave equation 
in the D8 background. The Einstein metric is 
ds_E^2=H^1/8  dy_i^2 + H^9/8  dx^2
which means that the wave equation for a scalar of mass
 in this background (the dilaton is such a scalar), with 
a constant, is 
(-a^2M^2)=0 
(_i^2 +H^-1 _x^2 -a^2M^2)=0
and then for a separated solution,
=e^ip_iy_i (x)
we get 
(_x^2 -p^2(1+Mx) -a^2M^2(1+Mx)^9/8 )(x)=0 .
Notice that this equation does not admit a constant wavefunction, 
since  is not a solution.
At large x, it has the asymptotic solutions
(x)=e^16 25 a (Mx)^25/16  
so we can keep only the decaying solution
and at small x it becomes a combination of the oscillatory solutions
(x)= e^ix-p^2-a^2M^2  
(for ).
So from matching the wavefunction and its derivative over  
we get a condition on , which will be that the coefficient of 
the  should be zero, which will imply a quantization condition,
of the type
p^2=-M_n^2(a,M) .
The same type of analysis should hold for every massive 
field in supergravity, so in general we will get a formula for the 
lightcone energy of the type 
E=p _ ^2+ M_n^2(a,M) 2p^+  .
Correspondingly, we expect to find in  that various moduli
have such an additional mass term, which will depend on the detailed
structure of the interactions permitted by the 8 linearly realized
supersymmetries. 
However, these massive 
moduli will appear only when we look at nontrivial wavefunctions 
for the  scalar  (other than =constant and small), so it is
hard to analyze. The moduli with trivial wavefunctions in the 
 direction will correspond to the massless supergravity modes, 
and as we saw, they have the right lightcone energy. Moreover, even 
if we would find the massive  moduli, on the supergravity side it is 
also hard to get any results  (although one could of course use
numerical methods to find the mass terms).  

But we can make one observation. On the supergravity side, all the 
fermions are massive, so we expect that also fermionic  moduli 
will have a mass term in the energy. One hint that this might happen 
is that we expect the D3 brane fermions to have a worldvolume mass 
term of the type . Indeed, although we do not know how to write 
down the D3 fermionic action for a general supergravity background, 
we know that in some backgrounds (like super-coset manifolds), the 
kinetic term for the fermions is of the type 
, where  is the spacetime Killing spinor operator 
pulled back on the worldvolume. The kinetic term then
 contains a term of the type
'H_  ^ which would imply a mass proportional to   (flat
indices). But for our closed string background in the 
Seiberg-Witten limit (), 
and , and so 
the fermion mass will be proportional to 
M =  l _s^2 = m
  r _1 r _2r _3 =mr_1 r_2r_3 l_P l _P  
=M l_P l _P 
with M being the supergravity mass. Then the moduli mass will be 
 and if we would get an 
energy , it would be
as desired. 
It would be of course very interesting to see whether one can recover
all the supergravity mass terms for the lightcone energy, but as we 
saw, the analysis looks quite difficult. 



Holographic dual 

Let us try to write down the holographic dual of our noncommutative 
 defined on () in the spirit of the AdS/CFT correspondence. 
We have to write down a solution for D3 branes in the 
closed string background 
() corresponding to () 
and then take a decoupling limit. It turns out however
to be easier to start with D1 branes in the background ()
and then make two T dualities. Indeed, 
as we saw, the background () corresponds to NS5
branes smeared over the directions 1,2,3. We have
to put D1 branes at  along time and . But this background 
is one of D1 ending on NS5's, smeared over the D1 direction, as well
as 2 others, transverse to both NS5 and D1. The S dual of this (type
IIB) configuration is F1 ending on D5, which we know that exists. Then
the original IIA metric is D0's parallel to KK monopoles, and after
 and  we have D2 ending  on KK monopoles, and finally after  
we have D3 ending on an unusually T dualized KK monopole (an 8
dimensional worldvolume). 

The solution for D1 ending on NS5's, depending only on the coordinate 
 can be found pretty easily, namely
ds^2 &=& -dt^2 H_1^-1/2  +H_1^1/2  d ^2_5 + H H_1^-1/2  
dx_1^2/r_1^2 + HH_1^1/2  (dx^2 +r_2^2 dx_2^2 +r_3^2
dx_3^2)

B_12  &=& m x_3

e^ & =& e^_0   r_1  H^1/2  H_1^1/2  .
T dualizing on  we get 
ds^2 &=& -dt^2 H_1^-1/2  +H_1^1/2  d ^2_5 + H H_1^-1/2  
dx_1^2/r_1^2 + HH_1^1/2  (dx^2  +r_3^2dx_3^2) 

&&+ H^-1 
  H_1^-1/2  r_2^2 (dx_2+ mx_3 dx_1)^2 

e^  &=& e^_0   r_1r_2  H_1^1/4   .
And finally, after the coordinate transformation ()
and  T duality, we get (putting back the  dependence )
ds^2 &=&l_s^4[ -dt^2l_s^-4  H_1^-1/2  +H_1^1/2  l_s^-4 
d ^2_5 + H H_1^-1/2  
dx_1^2/r_1^2 + HH_1^1/2  l_s^-4 
dx^2  

&&+ H^-1 
  H_1^-1/2   1+ l_s^4(r_1 r_2r_3 )^2 m^2 x_1^2/r_1^2  H^2
    H_1   (dx_2^2/r_2^2 +dx_3^2/r_3^2)] 

B_23 &=& -l_s^4m x_1  r_2^2 r_3^2 H^2 H_1  1 1+ l_s^4
(r_1 r_2r_3 )^2 m^2 x_1^2/r_1^2  H^2    H_1  


e^  & =& l_s^3e^_0   r_1r_2r_3 H^1/2    (1+ l_s^4                                                            
(r_1 r_2r_3 )^2 m^2 x_1^2/r_1^2  H^2    H_1  )^-1/2   .
However we need to generalize this to the fully localized solution,
where the D3-branes are not smeared over the transverse directions.


The first thing we can do is to look in the near core region. In the
near core region,  is constant (), and then there is no 
obstruction for making the harmonic function  depend on all its 
transverse coordinates. Indeed, since  is constant, we can ask to
find a D1 brane solution in the corresponding flat background, and 
that is just the usual D1 brane with a nontrivial  field, i.e.
(), with  and  
the usual harmonic function. Then after the two T dualities one gets
the solution (), where  and 
H_11+ 4g_s N '  ^2  ( ^2 +cx^2)^2
 1+  4g_s N '  ^2   ^4 
where in the last line we have used the fact that we work near 
. 

Let us now  derive the equation for the 
full solution (outside the core).  Partially localized intersections,
where brane 1 with harmonic function  
lives on , and brane 2 with harmonic function
 lives on 
, with overall transverse space ,
are written in terms of harmonic functions  and  in the
usual way, except that now  and  
satisfy the equations (e.g.,)
_z^2 H_1(z, y) + H_2(z) _y^2 H_1(z, y)=0, _z^2
H_2=0  or 

_z^2 H_2(z, x) + H_1(z) _x^2 H_2(z, x)=0, _z^2 
H_1=0 .
In other words, we delocalize one brane (say brane 2) over the
worldvolume coordinates of the other brane (1), 
and then  is harmonic  (obeys the Laplace equation) 
in the background of brane 2. This is true for any kind of branes, but
in particular has derived explicitly this equations for the 
11d intersection of M2 and M5 (over a string). This intersection is
related to our D1-NS5 solution as follows. Dimensionally reduce to
type IIA on the common string, to an F1-D4(0) solution, T dualize to
IIB on a transverse direction to a F1-D5(0), and then S dualize to 
D1-NS5(0). 

In our case, the harmonic function  is delocalized over the D1, that
is over , as well as over , over which we need to T
dualize, and  is delocalized over .
 So the full solution is given by (), where 
satisfies the equation
[_x^2 +H(x)_  ^2 ]H_1 ( ,
x)= Q ( ) (x)
where we have put explicitly the source term 
. 
Then also () and () are the corresponding
T dual solutions. 
We notice that near the core , , so the solution is 
indeed (). 


In order to solve (), we separate variables, by writing
H_1( , x)= 1+ d^5p (2)^5 e^ip      H_1,p (x)=1+ 1 8 ^3 1 r^2  _0 ^  dp p^2 ((pr) pr -(pr)) H_1,p (x)
and get the equation
H"_1,p (x)-p^2 H(x)H_1,p (x)= Q (x) .
By putting   (we will keep this form for now and replace 
it later with  and ) and 
x = (p m )^2/3 (c +m x)
we get the Airy equation 
d^2 H_p dx ^2 -x  H_p(x )= Q m^-1/3  p^-2/3 
(x - c (p/m)^2/3 )
which has solutions in terms of the Bessel functions  and 
. We choose  which decays exponentially at infinity, 
and get
H_p(x )= c_p x ^1/2  K_1/3  (2 3  x ^3/2 ) .
The coefficient  can be fixed by matching with the normalization 
of the  function source. We get
c_p = Q c  2p^1/3  m^2/3  [K_1/3  ( 2 3 
  p m  c^3/2 )- p m c^3/2 K_4/3  (2 3 
p m  c^3/2 )]  .
Therefore the final formula for the harmonic function is 
H_1(r,x)=1+Qc  8^3 m^2/3  ^1/3  r^2 
dp p^2 ((pr) pr -(pr)) K_1/3  (2 3  p) 
K_1/3  ( 2 3 
  p m  c^3/2 )- p m c^3/2 K_4/3  (2 3 
p m  c^3/2 ) 
with
=  (c+mx)^2/3  m  .
So we have found the full solution for the D3 branes in the
background. 

We can now write down the decoupling limit for the holographic dual
in the near core (), namely 
' 0, U =  '  =  fixed ,  X=x ' =fixed ,  g_s N = fixed  
but we have to supplement it with 
r_i 0, y _i = l_s^2 x_i r_i = fixed , 
   = m  r_1l_s^2 r_2 r_3 =fixed 
and then we have the holographic dual
ds^2 = ' [ U^2   (-dt^2 +dy _1^2 
+dy _2^2+dy _3^2 1+
 ^2 y _1^2
    U^4   )
+  U^2 (dX^2 +dU^2 +U^2 d_4^2)] .
This metric is then dual to  with
[y _2, y _3]=i y _1, 
 ds^2 = -dt^2+ dy _2^2 +dy _1^2 +dy _3^2 .
We note that the holographic dual in the near core region 
() is just what we would have
expected from the usual noncommutative case,
 with holographic dual
ds^2 =' [ U^2   (-dt^2 +dy_1^2 +
dy_2^2 +dy_3^2 1+^4 U^4   )+
  U^2 (dU^2 +U^2 d_5^2)]
and . 

To get the full holographic dual, since (remembering 
just for the purpose of next formula that what we call 
 is really , whereas  still appears in 
and also  denoting the integer= D8 number)
H= 1+ m g_s^A l_s  x =1 +m g_s^A l _s^2 l_s  X
=1+ X
we replace , , , together 
with the rest of the limit into (), and rescaling
the integration variable as  we get 
H_1 (r,x)h_1(U,X) l_s^4 
where
h_1(U,X)= 2g_s N  ^2/3  
 ^1/3  U^2 _0^  dP P^2 (
(PU) PU -(PU))
K_1/3 (2 3    P) K_1/3 
(2 3 P   ) -P   
K_4/3 (2 3 P   ) 
and
  = (1+  X)^2/3     .
Then the full holographic dual is 
ds^2=' [ h_1^-1/2 (U, X)(-dt^2 +Hdy _1^2+
H^-1 dy _2^2+dy _3^2 1+
 ^2 y _1^2
    U^4   ) +h_1^1/2 (HdX^2+dU^2 +U^2 d_4^2)] .
We note that the Seiberg-Witten limit is a subset of the holographic 
limit, as it should be. 


Conclusions and Discussion 

We have proposed a new nonperturbative formulation of massive Type IIA
string theory in terms of a noncommutative Yang-Mills theory with
space dependent noncommutativity parameter. There remains much to
study. In particular, it would be very interesting to construct in
more detail the interaction terms in the action, the energies of 
physical excitations and to study the
S-duality properties of this noncommutative gauge theory.
A more direct derivation of the non-commutative 
Yang Mills in section 5 starting from the solution of the 
Matrix Theory constraints of section 4, using information about the 
action of zero branes in the curved space of the twisted torus 
will be useful. In fact it may be easier to try and guess
the form of the zero brane action which would lead to the 
actions in section 5, using the  matrices constructed in 
section 4. Progress in these directions is likely to also 
be useful in flux compactifications since T-duality of the twisted 
torus gives a background with -flux as discussed in section 3. 
These compactifications offer promising avenues toward the problem 
of fixing moduli in string  phenomenology . 

We note that we have described massive IIA theory in terms of a matrix
model of D3 branes with noncommutativity, a theory which has a
holographic dual. As a limit, massless IIA theory is described by a
matrix model of D3 branes, which is dual to string theory in 
. But there are two things we should observe:

1)The D3 branes are on a torus, which translates in making
identifications in  (in Poincare coordinates, 
, and the  coordinates are identified 
on a torus).

2)There are different observables in the D3 brane theory which
describe flat space IIA string theory and  
string theory. For , we look at gauge invariant
observables in the D3 brane theory, whereas for the IIA matrix model 
we look at wavefunctions on the moduli space, thereby  spontaneously breaking gauge
invariance. Holographic duals in the context of 8-brane solutions 
 have also been discussed recently in.


We comment  on the relation of this 
construction to Type IA string
theory, where D8-branes and O8-planes coexist. The massive
Type IIA physics is recovered by focusing on the local physics
between a pair of separated D8-branes, or equivalently, by sending the
D8-branes and O8-planes off to infinity. There exists a Matrix
proposal for the complete nonperturbative Type IA system
 which is related by S-duality to the 
 heterotic string. It would be interesting to recover the
noncommutative theory described in this paper by integrating out
degrees of freedom in these heterotic Matrix models.

As we mentioned in section 2, a generalized Scherk-Schwarz
reduction based on a scaling symmetry of the equations 
of motion gives a ten dimensional supergravity which 
has de Sitter solution. 
It was observed in  that these
can be viewed in terms a Euclidean radial reduction from M Theory. 
This suggests 
that a Matrix Model could be found by generalizing the dimensional 
reduction methods of Matrix Theory that we have used to 
radial reductions. This is of course a non-trivial generalization 
since the spacetime of M-Theory, and hence a  Euclidean radial 
direction, appears very indirectly in Matrix Theory.  Rather 
than imposing the constraints directly on a a few  fields 
corresponding to the compactified directions, one has to 
scale all the  matrices as well as the worldline time coordinate. 
This approach appears non-trivial and very different 
from  proposals made for a Matrix Model 
for de Sitter made  so far,, 
and is an interesting avenue for the future.

Appendix A. Limits  


In this appendix we review the various Matrix theory limits, 
and derive the correct limit in our case. 
For completeness, let us recall the formulas relating the M theory
parameters on a spatial circle to the IIA string theory parameters. 
They are obtained from
1 g_s l_s =1 R_11   ,
1 l_s^2 =R_11  l_P^3  .





Sen and Seibergused a construction for M theory compactified on 
 in a limit of vanishing radii. We refer to this as 
theory, taking 
l_P, R_11 , R_i 0 g_s,
l_s 0
such that 
a_i = R_i l_P ,  M=R_11  l_P^2 
are held fixed. After dimensionally reducing on  to string 
theory and making T dualities on all the , the T dual variables are
l _s &=& l_s = M^-1  g_s^1/3 

R _i &=& l_s^2 R_i  = 1 Ma_i 

g _s &=&g_s _i=1 ^p (R_i/l_s)  =
g_s^1-p/3 
_i=1 ^p a_i ^-1 
and moreover 
1 g_YM ^2 =l_s^3 g_s ,  1 g _YM ^2 
=l_s^3-p  g _s 
such that 
g_YM ^2 = M^3,  g _YM ^2 = M^3-p  _i=1 ^p
a_i^-1  .
So the limit was chosen to decouple string theory both in the original 
and in the dual theory (
), 
while keeping the Yang-Mills couplings ( of the 
D0-branes and  of the Dn-branes)  and the dual radii
finite.

Let us now review the BFSS point of view, which
is also  advocated for the Matrix string of type IIA, and the Matrix
theory of type IIB, and then apply it for our case. After that, we
will look at the relation between Sen-Seiberg and BFSS and apply it
to the Matrix models, finally deriving our limit.

BFSS chose the limit 
R_11 N ,  l_P =fixed  .
 
So that 
g_s = (R_11 /l_P)^3/2 ,  l_s
=l_P^3/2  R_11 ^1/2   0
and thus one obtained an  D0 brane theory. The argument
being that in the limit, string theory does decouple (even though
 is infinite), because there are no string states other than D0
branes which have momentum on the 11th direction (that is the D0 
charge), and so if we look at fixed momentum , strings
decouple.

The analogous statement happened for the IIA Matrix string
. One added
to the above construction a compactification on a finite , and
then made a 9-11 flip, meaning one reinterprets 9 as the 11-th
direction. Since  was finite, after the flip
g _s =(R_9 l_P )^3/2 =finite ,  l_s =
l_P^3/2  R_9^1/2  =finite  .
The IIB Matrix theory was similar. Add to the BFSS two extra radii 
, with =finite. We know that M theory 
on this space gives IIB with finite coupling. Then take the BFSS
construction and consider , but independent of 
(which is consistent with the BFSS limit), such that one holds 
 and  fixed (the  type IIB string tensions
fixed), then flip 9-11. 

Then 
g_s^B=R_1 R_2  , l_s^2=l_P^3 R_1 
are fixed in this limit. 

Similarly for our case, for the new Matrix theory of type IIA obtained
by compactifying on a radius of zero size, we have, first for the
massless case: compactify on an extra  and make a T
duality so that 
g_s^A=g_s^Bl_s R_3 =R_1l_s R_2R_3 =fixed , 
l_s^2 =l_P^3 R_9 =fixed 
where we have as before flipped 9-11 (so this corresponds to
IIA with ), and we note that now  goes to
zero, and it is  which is finite. 
For the massive IIA case, everything is similar, with the
addition of the new parameter . 

The  equivalence of the BFSS limit and the Seiberg-Sen limitwas derived as follows.
The light-like circle compactification for finite  (DLCQ, see 
)
with  finite (BFSS corresponds to ,  infinite, keeping 
 finite, with other possible compactified directions of fixed
radii ), 
    +
  
is understood as the  limit of 
    +
  
which is the infinite boost limit (  ) of 
    +
   .
So the light-like compactification of M theory on  is related to the
 limit of the spatial compactification of another M
theory. If we subsequently rescale Planck's constant such that 
and  are held fixed we obtain the  theory described above.
So
&&g _s = (R_11  M _P)^3/2 ,  M _s^2 = R_11 
M _P^3

&& p^+=N/R,  p^-RM_P^2 ,  p^iR_i M_P
 
&&p_11  = N/R_11  , 
p ^-R_11 M _P^2,  p ^iR _i M _P
and then 
R_11  M _P^2 =R M_P^2, R _i M _P= R_i M_P
are held fixed in the  limit. Then
g _s = (R_11  M _P)^3/2  = R_11 ^3/4 
(RM_P^2)^3/4 0,   M _s^2=R_11  M _P^3
=R_11 ^-1/2 
(RM_P^2)^3/2 so string theory decouples and the D0 coupling is fixed
g_YM ^2 =g _s M _s^3= (R_11  M_P^2)^3= (RM_P^2)^3 .
If the (BFSS) M theory is compactified on a torus of fixed radii 
then one T dualizes the string theory coming from the  theory
and gets
R _i &=& 1 R _i M _s^2 = 1 R _i
M _P^3R_11  =1 R_i R M_P^3 

g _s &=& g _s M _s^p _i R _i= 
M _s^p-3 R^3 M_P^6 _i R _i 0  if  
p<3 

g _YM, Dp ^2 &=& g _s M _s^p-3  = R^3
M_P^6 _i R _i .
So again string theory decouples and one gets a Dp brane theory of
fixed Yang-Mills coupling and dual radii. 

Applying this to the Matrix string theory, one relates again M theory
on light-like , with  fixed and  fixed to the
 theory with 
, that is a D0 brane theory on a
vanishing circle. After T duality, it becomes a D1 brane theory with
fixed . 

On the M theory side, one flips 9-11, reinterpreting it as string
theory with a light-like coordinate , so
g_s= (R_9 M_P)^3/2  ,  l_s =l_P^3/2  R_9^-1/2 , R N l_s .
Then on the  theory side, string theory decouples:
g _s&=& R_s^1/2  (RM_P^2)^3/2  R _9 0

M _s^2 &=& R_s^-1/2  (RM_P^2)^3/2 and the Yang-Mills parameters are
R _9= l_s^2 R ,  g _YM ^2 =1 g_s^2 
R _9^2 
In this way a D1 theory with fixed parameters is related to a string 
theory with  fixed parameters. 












































For our IIA Matrix model, M theory with 
 with 
g_s^A=R_1 l_s R_2 R_3 ,  l_s=l_P^3/2  R_1^-1/2 
fixed. Passing to the -theory we see we are left with a
decoupled D3-brane theory on the T-dual space with parameters






R _1 =l_s^2 R ,  R _2 =g_s^A l_s R_3 R , 
R _3=g_s^A l_s R_2 R ,  g _s=g _YM ^2
=l_sg_s^A R_1  .
We notice though that the Yang-Mills coupling and 2 of the radii  are
actually not finite, so there is probably a better description, but one
has to find it. In particular, since the Yang-Mills coupling is going
to infinity, one should S dualize, but the problem is in the presence
of the noncommutativity it is not very obvious what that means, so we 
will stick with this description. 
At  the S-dual is a good description, and 
g _s,D =g ^2_YM, D =R_1 l_s g_s^A 0 .
But under S duality, the "dimensionless Newton constant" 
  (with R a fixed length scale in
the metric) is invariant (since 
 and we would like to have  as 
well as . (then, the S dual theory is  
decoupled, and therefore so is the original theory)
The condition can be written as  
, that is, the coefficient of the
first loop  correction to the action should be
negligible, and this condition is satisfied if we 
have an  theory.






We also notice that  fixed, but 
, but all  (so 
we are talking about a 3+1d !) and there are 2 fixed quantities, a
dimensionless one,
, and a 
dimensionful one, 
, which will be related to  and ,
respectively.
