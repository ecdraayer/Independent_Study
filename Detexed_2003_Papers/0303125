Brane-induced gravity in five dimensions (Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati
model) exhibits modification of gravity at ultra-large distances,
  where
 is the five-dimensional gravity scale.
This makes the model 
potentially interesting for explaining the observed
acceleration of the Universe. We argue, however,
that it has an intrinsic intermediate
energy scale .
At higher energies,
the model is strongly coupled. For  of order of the present
Hubble size, the strong coupling regime occurs at distanced below
tens of metres.


Introduction 

Whether there exists a consistent and phenomenologically
acceptable theory of gravity in which gravitational interactions get
modified at ultra-large distances is an interesting problem.
Indeed, the large-scale modification of gravity might become an
appealing way of explaining the accelerated expansion of the Universe
at the present epoch. At first sight, modification of gravity at
ultra-large distances may naturally occur in theories with large
or infinite extra dimensions. However, several models of this
sort , in which
linearized gravity experienced by brane matter has purely tensor
structure, have been shown to have
ghosts .
Because of the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov phenomenon, 
an alternative is that gravity linearized about flat background has a
scalar component. This feature is similar to 4d gravity with massive
graviton, and it is indeed inherent in the five-dimensional induced
gravity model of Dvali, Gabadadze and Porrati
(DGP) , as well as in other no-ghost brane-world
models .

Four-dimensional gravity with massive graviton has been shown to
possess a strong-interaction energy scale, which is intermediate
between the Planck mass and graviton
mass . This property, and 
other arguments  suggest that similar strong
interaction scale may be present in no-ghost brane-world models with
gravity modified at ultra-large scales. In this note we address this
issue in the framework of DGP model, whose action is a sum
 S_tot  = S_bulk  + S_brane 
where the 5d bulk piece is
 S_bulk  = M^3  d^5X g^(5)   R^(5) 
+  total divergence 
and the brane term is
   S_brane  = M_Pl ^2_brane  d^4x g^(4)   R^(4) 
At distances
         M^-1  r r_c
where
   r_c = M_Pl ^2 M^3 
linearized gravity with sources on the brane is four-dimensional, while
it becomes five-dimensional at ultra-large distances, . 

In this paper we argue that DGP model has an inherent energy scale
 E_strong  = (M^9 M^4_Pl  )^1 5  
At energies above this scale, scalar (in 4d sense) degrees of freedom
become strongly interacting, so the model does not admit classical
treatment. It is worth noting that these degrees of freedom do not
decouple. This makes DGP model an unlikely candidate for explaining
the acceleration of the Universe: if  is of the order of the
present Hubble size, the theory is strongly coupled at distances below
 m.

This issue has been addressed independently by Luty, Porrati and
Rattazzi . Their conclusion is similar in spirit, but not in 
detail: their energy scale of strong interaction is ,
which is lower than our scale (). The origin of this
disagreement is unclear at the moment.

This paper is organized as follows. To get an idea of "large"
degrees of freedom, we study DGP model in Section 2 at linearized
level (quadratic action). We first find that the full propagator in
de Donder-Fock gauge has large terms with scalar structure (in 4d
sense). These terms are pure gauge in the bulk but not on the brane. 
We then discuss the quadratic action in Gaussian normal gauge, and
introduce a change of variables after which the degrees of freedom
decouple into tensor part, suppressed near the brane, and unsuppressed
scalar (and vector) part. This change of variables induces large 
brane bending term into the metric, which is again pure gauge in the
bulk but not on the brane. This term is enhanced by ,
signalizing strong interaction between the scalar modes. In Section 3
we proceed to study the action at cubic order to see that naive power
counting does not work, due to cancellations, but there remain
unavoidable cubic terms enhanced by . These are precisely
the terms that make the theory strongly coupled at the energy scale 
(). We conclude in Section 4.

Linearized theory 

Let us begin with the linearized theory about flat background in 
de Donder-Fock gauge. It is straightforward to calculate the full
propagator in this gauge. Let
  
denote the free 5-dimensional  propagator in mixed 
momentum-coordinate representation,
  D_5 = e^-p y-y'  p 
Hereafter ,  and  is the
four-momentum
(we work with Euclidean version of DGP model).
Let us denote
  D_0 = D_0 (p,y) D_5 (p;y,0) = e^-p y  p 
and
  D_0^  =D_0^  (p,y') D_5 (p;0,y')= D_0(p,y')
We also use the notation 
  D_0 0  = D_00  (p) D_5 (p;0,0) = 1 p 
Then the
graviton propagator in DGP model in 
de Donder-Fock gauge has the following non-zero
components 
D_5 5 ^5 5  (p, y,y') = 1 M^3 
2 3  D_5 + 
M_Pl ^2 M^6  2 3  p^2 D_0 D_0^ 
 D_5 ^5   = 1 M^3  D_5 ^_and
 
To make contact with Ref. , one notices that the
brane-to-brane propagator may be written as follows,
 
The first term here determines the interaction between 
conserved sources on the brane, at linearized level. At intermediate
distances () one has ,
so this interaction has 4d form. 
Note that the second term 
does not vanish when contracted with conserved , so
matter on the brane couples to scalar degrees of freedom at strength
set by the 5d mass .

Let us come back to the full propagator. It
has large parts, the last terms in
() and (). These terms may be gauged away
everywhere in the bulk, but not on the brane. Indeed, they may be
parametrized by introducing a 4d scalar "field"
 whose propagator equals , and whose contribution 
to metric is
  
Outside the brane, the "field"  may indeed be
gauged away. Thus, we see that 4d scalars in DGP model have fairly
peculiar properties; in particular, they appear enhanced by .

To study the model in more detail, let us move to the Gaussian 
normal gauge, 
   h_55  = h_5  = 0
and calculate the quadratic action.
Let us decompose the metric
  h_  = h_ ^TT  + (p_  u_+ p_u_)
+ p_p_v + 1 2 _  
where  is transverse traceless (in 4d sense),
   p_h^TT  _= h^TT  _= 0
and  is transverse
   p_u^= 0
Then one finds, at quadratic order,
  S =  dy d^4 x  L_GN 
where
 
We are interested in the part that
contains 4d scalars  and , last line in eq. (). 
We can get rid of the very last term, which is proportional to
, by defining a new field , such 
that
   v (p,y) = (p,0) M_Pl ^2 2M^3  y + 
v (p,y)
Then in tems of  and  the last line in 
()  is precisely the part of quadratic 5d action
(in the gauge ()) that contains 4d scalars,
 L_scalar  = 3M^3  (p^2 _y^2 v   +  
_y^2  - 1 2 p^2 )
Hence, "canonically normalized" scalars and vectors are
   v ^can , ^can , u_ ^can  = 
v  M^3/2    , 
 M^3/2     ,  u_ M^3/2  
where we made use of the fact that
the quadratic term with , second line in
(), also has the 5d form.

But the metric contains large piece
   h_ ^large  = _  _ 
M_Pl ^2 2M^3  y(p,0)
This piece is pure gauge everywhere outside the brane.
Say, at  the large piece may be gauged away by the gauge
transformation with
 
On the other hand, 
the large piece () is not pure gauge on the brane.

Most naively, the cubic and higher order terms in the action
appear to be enhanced by high powers of , because of the
presence of the large piece () in the metric. However,
since this piece is longitudinal in 4d sense, and pure gauge outside
the brane, one expects strong cancellations. Let us see that 
large terms in the 
cubic action indeed cancel, but not completely.

Cubic order 


We still work in Gaussian normal gauge,
   g_55  = 1 , g_5   = 0
The brane is placed at , and we consider metric 
symmetric with respect to the brane,
  g_ (x, -y) = g_ (x,y)

The bulk Lagrangian may be conveniently written in the
 form
 
We pursue the idea of making the change of variables from the metric 
 to another "metric"  in such 
a way that the largest pieces of the brane action are cancelled by
the contribution due to the bulk action.
The metric  is related to  by a gauge
transformation on the right of the brane, and another gauge
transformation on the left of the brane, so new contribution
to the action
appears at the brane only. The transformation from
metric  to  is single-valued on the
brane, so  metric induced on the brane is uniquely defined in terms
of . Metric  still has to obey
the gauge conditions () and symmetry property
().

To this end, let us study what are the 5d gauge 
transformations that leave the conditions ()
satisfied. We write
  g_AB  (X) = X ^C X^A  
               X ^D X^B 
               g _CD (X (X))








where , and
in perturbation theory 
   X ^A = X^A + ^A (X)
We will need the relation between metric perturbations 
 and 
at quadratic order,
 h_AB  = _A _B + _B _A
+ _C h _AB  ^C
+_A ^C h _BC  
+_B ^C h _AC  
+ _A ^C _B _C
where all functions are functions of  and indices are raised and
lowered by  Euclidean metric.
 We require
  h _55  = 0
on the left of the brane, and on the right of the brane separately.
This gives the following equation
  2 _5 _5 + _5 ^5 _5 _5
  + _5 ^_5 _= 0
The requirement
 h _5  = 0
gives
_5 _+ __5
+ _5 ^5 __5
+ _5 ^__+ _5 ^h _  = 0
We stress that these equations should be satisfied on the left of the
brane and on the right of the brane separately. 
To ensure the symmetry property ()
for both   and  , we take
  symmetric, and
  anti-symmetric in , that is
 
Solving eqs. () and () on the left 
and on the right of the brane, and imposing (),
we find
 _5 = sign  (y) - 
1 2 _^ y  
_= - _y
          + _sign  (y) 
_0^y dy' h _^where  is an arbitrary 
function of 4d coordinates only,
    = (x^)
Physically,  is a 
brane bending function, at least to linear
order in metric perturbations.
We will use the freedom parametrized by 
to get rid of certain large terms in the total action.

The 4d components of the metric are then
 
Note that in spite of the jump of , the latter relation
is well defined, i.e.,  is uniquely defined on the brane
in terms of  and  (provided that
 is symmetric). 

Let us clarify the logic again. We may forget about previous steps,
and merely consider eq. () as the definition
of the change of variables from  to  in
the gauge (), with  and  defined by 
eqs. () and () in terms of yet arbitrary
function . The further procedure is to calculate the
total action, up to cubic order, and then choose  to
simplify this action.

We will need the expression
for  on the brane:
  h_  (y=0) = h _ 
 + __Let us now calculate the action in terms of  and 
. We begin with the bulk term. Since 
does not jump across the brane, the action is the sum of integrals
of the Lagrangian () over regions
left and right of the brane. We write in each of these regions
   (g  R^(5) [g])(X) = det  
( X ^A X^B  ) 
(g   R^(5) [g ])(X (X))
This gives, up to cubic order,
 
where
R ^(5)  = R^(5) [g ]
and all quantities are functions of . 
Since  and  are symmetric, and 
vanishes at the brane, one finds that the
integration of ()
over regions left and right of the brane gives the following
additional contribution to the action
  -2 M^3 _brane  d^4x g   R ^(5)  Let us now consider the second term in eq.().
It is equal to
   2 M^3 _5^2 g 
and hence contributes to the action as 
 - 2M^3 [_5 g ]_y -0 ^y +0 
Now, we have
  g  = det (^_+ _^)
g  (x^+ ^, y + ^5) 


For 
the right hand side is a total 4d divergence, so we 
have to evaluate the determinant here to the first order only,

.  

Then modulo total 4d divergence, one has up to cubic order
g  = g   +
det (^_+ _^)
(_5 g   ^5
+ __5 g   ^^5
+ 1 2  ^2_5 g   ^5 ^5
)
which gives, again up to total 4d divergence,
g  = g  
+ _5 g   ^5
- _5 g   ^_^5
+  1 2  ^2_5 g   ^5 ^5

Now, both  and  vanish on the
brane, so the third term here does not contribute
to (). The fourth term does not contribute at
cubic level too, because  is continuous
at quadratic level. The contribution from the second term is entirely
due to the first term in (), since the second term 
in () is 
smooth across the brane. Thus, the additional
contribution to the action is
 - 4 M^3 _brane  d^4x  ^2_5g   This contribution, together with the contribution ()
adds to
  - 2 _brane  d^4x  L_bulk [g ]
-2  _brane  d^4x  (x) 
(M^3 g  R ^(4)   
+ L [g _ ])
where  is defined in eq. ().

Let us  turn to the brane action.
The contribution due to  into the brane action comes from
the second term in eq. (). To cubic order, it is
        M_Pl ^2  d^4x g  
(R ^(4)   - 1 2  g ^  
R ^(4) 
) __Thus, the total action  equals  
plus the sum of
() and ().


Now, let us discuss scalar and vector modes (in 4d sense).
These are parametrized as follows,
g _  (x,y)= 
x ^ x^  
x ^ x^  
g _  (x (x,y), y)
where
   x ^= x^+ ^(x,y)
(at linear level, 
in notations of section 2) 
and
 g _  = e ^2(x,y)  _ 
The brane action is then
   S_brane [g ] = 6 M_Pl ^2  d^4x  e ^2 
   _^Thus, the total action, up to cubic level, is
  S_tot  = S_bulk  [g ]  + S_brane [g ]
      + S_ 
where  is the additional brane term, 
the sum of
() and ().
We write
 R ^(4) _  - 1 2  g _  R ^(4)  = 
-2 __+ 
2 _  ^(4)  +  (higher orders in  
, )
and
    g   R ^(4) 
=
-6 ^(4)  +  (higher orders in  
, )
and obtain explicitly
 
where  is quadratic in fields  and ,
 
At quadratic order, the relevant terms in the action are
  6  d^4x  (2M^3 ^(1)  ^(4)  + M_Pl ^2
  _^)
where  is linear in metric perturbations.
To get rid of these terms, we choose
(cf. eq. ())
  ^(1)  (x) = M_Pl ^2 2M^3  (x, y=0)
then the contribution () vanishes.

At cubic level, the largest terms are
 
These are cancelled out by choosing
^(2)  (x) = M_Pl ^6 12 M^9  (_^) (x, y=0)
After this choice is made, the action for 4d scalars
and vectors becomes, up to cubic level,
S_tot  = S_bulk  (, ^)
+ M_Pl ^2 _brane   d^4x L _2 (, ^)
Thus, we see that due to the cancellations, the largest possible terms
disappear, and the cubic action is enhanced by  only.

In fact, we can do better by choosing
^(2)  (x) = M_Pl ^6 12 M^9  (_^) (x, y=0)
+ M_Pl ^2 4M^3 (3^2 - 2 _^)

Then those terms in eq. () that do not contain transverse
derivatives, cancel out, and we obtain finally
 
Further reduction of the cubic action is impossible, as the remaining
terms are not proportional to .


With "canonicaly normalized" scalars and vectors
(), the largest interaction term is
proportional to

 M_Pl ^2 M^9/2  
On dimensional grounds
we conclude that the energy scale of strong interaction between 
the scalar and vector modes is
indeed given by eq. ().

Discussion 

The approach taken in this paper is not quite satisfactory.
The problems with this approach are twofold.
First, it is not at all obvious that the conclusion that
the strong interaction scale is () will not be
different when higher (quartic, etc.) orders are included.
Indeed, the powers of  proliferate, as is seen in
eq. (). Second, the geometrical meaning of
the whole procedure of cancelling
large terms is obscure. On the other hand, our calculation does
 show that DGP model becomes strongly coupled at low energy scale.
It remains to be understood whether this feature is inevitable in
no-ghost models with modification of gravity
at ultra-large scales.
