Review of ghost gluing vertices 
The ghost gluing vertex 
is a multilinear map from the -th tensor power of the
ghost Fock space to complex numbers. For a free
ghost conformal field theory the ghost vertex can be
written as a Gaussian state. However there are
two subtleties. The first one is related to
non-zero background charge  of the ghost systems
( for -ghosts and  for -ghosts).
The second subtlety is related to the choice of
picture but it is important only for fermionic -ghosts,
which are bosons. The ghosts occur in conjugate
pairs with scale dimensions  and .
By NN   cancels from the
ghost (anti)commutators if we expand
as in 32 .

Ghost gluing vertex 
There are several equivalent representations for the
-ghost gluing vertex. For our purpose it
is convenient to use the representation constructed
by Gross and JevickiGJ  (the second paper).
The other formulation can be found inpeskin1 .
So the -string gluing vertex is of the formGJ 
multline 
V_3^2,-1 =N_gh   _123 +

Fock space,  is related to the 
vacuum via ,
 and  are annihilation
operators acting in the -th Fock space,  is a twist
operator
and  are the ghost Neumann matrices which we are going
to diagonalize.

There are two ways to express the operator 
in terms of the maps . We use one which was described
by Gross and JevickiGJ  (paper 2). They related
the -string ghost Neumann matrix  to
the -string matter () Neumann matrix  as
equation 
M^IJ _bc =(-1)^I+J (-M^IJ _6 
+M^I,J+3 _6 )for I,J=1,2,3,
M6->gM3 
equation 
where operators  are given by
equation M" . From these -string Neumann matrices
one can also obtain -string matter matrices by
equation 
M^IJ _3 =M^IJ _6 
+M^I,J+3 _6 ,I,J=1,2,3.
M6->M3

The second method is related to conformal gluingpeskin1 
and its application will be considered elsewheredima3 .



Superghost gluing vertex 
The case of  superghosts is more complicated because
of the pictures. Here we will consider the -string vertex
over the picture  vacuumGJ  (paper 3):
equation 
V_3= _123 -1[
_I,J=1 ^3 _r,s=12 ^ 
_r ^(I) (M^IJ _ C)_rs _s^(J)

where  is a tensor product of three
Fock vacua in the  picture, 
are ghost/antighost annihilation operators
acting in the th Fock space,  are
Neumann matrices, which we are going to diagonalize,
 is a twist matrix
and  is the midpoint insertion.
The Neumann  matrix  is given by the generating
functionGJ  (paper 3, equation (4.35)), which in our notations takes the form

As another check of our result one
can easily show that
the sum M6->M3  of -string Neumann

the -string matrices M" .
In particular, the sum M6->M3  of
-string Neumann matrix eigenvalues M6's 
yields the -string eigenvalues M10 .

Now we will rewrite the ghost -string vertex
Vgh1  in the diagonal basis. To this end we
introduce ghost continuum oscillators:

From our experience with momentum Neumann matrices we know
that the zero modes can be added by a unitary transformation
U . We show that a similar thing happens
for ghosts: the term proportional to  in
the exponent Vgh2  can be obtained by a unitary
transformation acting on the first line of Vgh2 .

This unitary operator and the

The infinite matrices in Witten's vertex are
easy to diagonalize. It just requires some
 lore plus a Watson-Sommerfeld transformation.
We calculate the eigenvalues of all Neumann matrices
for all scale dimensions ,
both for matter and ghosts, including fractional 
which we use to
regulate the difficult  limit. We find that
 eigenfunctions just acquire a  term,
and  gets replaced by the midpoint position.





Introduction  
Witten derived open strings from a field
theory with cubic Lagrangian. Its loop graphs include closed
strings. The kinetic term is the BRST operator,
which in Siegel gauge reduces to  . Unfortunately
the basis which diagonalizes    leads to forbiddingly
complicated formulae for the vertex. It was known
from the beginning that    commuted with
Witten's vertex, but only recently did Rastelli et al.
 have the idea of transforming it to the basis with
     diagonal. After a long indirect  calculation,
which omitted the momenta, they
found that the Neumann matrices in the vertex take a
simple diagonal form in this basis. Subsequent authors
have extended their work for boson matter sector
including momenta, boson's ghost sector,
fermion matter sectorand fermion's ghosts.

    In this paper we develop
a powerful new method based on 
representation theory. It easily diagonalizes the star product for all
scale dimensions , both for matter fields and ghosts.
In most cases we confirm previous authors (though our proofs
are an order of magnitude shorter). The exception is  ,
which is crucial. Our answer is
simple: Including the momentum does nothing to the
continuum eigenvalues. It adds a momentum term to
their eigenfunctions, and also a zero mode oscillator
which is just that for      with    replaced by
the midpoint position .

    In section , we review  representations
for different scale dimensions , and carefully
normalize the eigenvectors      of      and
   of   . In section  we
diagonalize the -string Neumann matrices for matter
fields and in section  the -string matrices for
the ghosts and superghosts, using Watson-Sommerfeld transformations.
Each
matrix is diagonalized independently, so the
identities connecting them are a cross-check.
In section  we examine the zero modes closely.
Most of the confusion in earlier papers arose from
regularizing them inconsistently.
Section  checks that
 the momentum Neumann
matrices can be correctly reconstructed.
 Section  is a
summary. In Appendix , we calculate     in
the new basis. Appendix  lists some lemmas.

Conclusion 
    For nonzero scale dimension , our results largely confirm
previous authors, though our proofs are much
shorter and clearer.
For  we are dealing with unitary representations
of  or its covering group. The discrete basis
with  diagonal is basisn . From it we constructed
a Cauchy kernel id , which projects
onto the entire Hilbert space.
A Watson-Sommerfeld transformation then expanded
it in the continuous -basis which diagonalizes .
The eigenfunctions are kappas  with normalization
As . The transformation matrix between the bases is
<mk> .

Another integral kernel Mmaps  generates the -string
Neumann matrices. The same Watson-Sommerfeld
transformation expands it in the
 basis, where it is diagonal. The ratio to the
diagonalized Cauchy kernel then gives the Neumann
eigenvalues
 
 
where
 
Note the simple formula valid for all  and .

Unitarity fails at , where there is a vector with infinite norm.
In the second quantized world-sheet theory this corresponds
to a zero frequency oscillator,
and the divergence is eliminated by transforming it
to position and momentum (Section ).
The Neumann eigenvalues are the same as for , but the
eigenfunctions differ.
If  are the usual oscillators
from the  basis, then the continuum
oscillators in the  basis are
 
a^ (,p)
=i [
 2 2  
]^1/2 P p   
+_1 +1 2 _2 
.


.
+1 6 (^2-2)_3 +
1 24 (^3-8)_4 +.
(We have suppressed Lorentz indices.)
For  these reduce to the  continuum oscillators.
The average position  is also replaced by the midpoint
position
 
Then  form
a complete basis for the  world-sheet field theory with
 
 and  arise from an additional nonnormalizable
state at . The expansion of  in
these new oscillators is X_Lcont . Similar
results for other world-sheet fields can be found in
phipm  - psiz  and 610 .

Plane waves will now contain the midpoint position 
instead of . The bosonized ghost insertions
at curvature points will therefore be very simple in
this basis.

The zero momentum and non-zero momentum oscillators
are related by the unitary transformation 
 
where  is the momentum operator.
One can consider this alternatively as a unitary string field redefinition
.
There are two consequences.
Firstly, remember that the cubic interaction looks
nonlocal if it is written in the component
fields corresponding to  since it
involves exponentials of .
This is cured by the field redefinition.
Secondly, the BRST charge changes to
* 
which adds terms linear and quadratic in .
Therefore the action in  the component fields
corresponding to  now looks local,
which may  help in constructing lump and rolling tachyon solutions.


For the  and  ghosts (Section )
we took the easy way out by using a vacuum in which
their Neumann matrices can be related to those
of the matter fields. However the ghost eigenvalues
certainly depend on the
vacuum, and in other vacua are nonhermitian. This
question deserves further investigation,
as does BRST invariance in the  basis.
In Appendix  we suggest some expressions
for the Virasoro operator  in the  basis.

In usual field theory,  space is appropriate
to weak coupling,  space to strong coupling. Diagonalizing
the vertex may therefore allow a latticized strong
coupling approach to string field theory,
and make concrete the old idea of induced gravity.
Perhaps we really live in flat
 space-time, and what we see is just illusion.
This was one of our motivations for solving this preliminary
mathematical problem. Another motivation was
to study the relation of Witten's string
product to the Moyal product as described in and
. This may help give a mathematical understanding
of the string algebra in the -theory context.

Review of the gluing vertices 
Oscillator normalization 
Consider a primary conformal field  of
dimension . Here we assume that  is an integer,
and  is a boson or fermion depending on whether
 is an integer
or half integer. In the  sector the field has a mode expansion
 
We decompose it into creation and annihilation parts
with respect to the -invariant vacuum:
 
where  is defined by basisn , and
 
 
The "rest" consist of oscillators annihilating
both the -invariant vacuum and its
conjugate (for example for  it contains ).
We assume the following (anti)commutation relations between the oscillators
 
Although these are not the most general commutation
relations, they cover the cases in which  we are
interested: bosonic fields with  or 
and fermionic field with .
In any case the two point correlation function of fields  is
 
where  comes from our normalization convention
bfaosc .

Before we proceed with formulation of a gluing vertex
let us consider a couple of examples:  and .
Discussion of the tricky case  we postpone to Section .

For  the fermionic conformal field  has
the following mode expansion
 
 
and the two point correlation function is
 
By comparing this correlation function with
OOcorf  for  one concludes that
* 
and therefore
 

For  the bosonic conformal field  has
the following mode expansion
 
 
and the two point correlation function is

OOcorf  for  one concludes that

and therefore
 



Continuum oscillators 
So by the unitary transformation <mk> ,
 
are the oscillators in the -basis, satisfying
 

Now we expand world sheet fields  in these -oscillators.
We assume that  is on the unit circle, which allows
us to change  to  (This is not a restriction
for us, because we are only interested
in the world-sheet fields on the boundary). Hence the expansion is
 
._s(z)_z=1 =
_- ^  d

a ^+(),s(z)
+a ^-()^2s ,s()
+rest 


_- ^  dA_s() 

a ^+()[w]^2s e^iw 
+a ^-()^2s 
[]^2s e^-i 
+rest .
This expansion is easy to obtain by using the
representation 218  for the Cauchy kernel.





Gluing vertex 
The -string vertex  is a multilinear map from
the -th  power of an oscillator Fock space to the complex numbers.
For a conformal field  of dimension  (described
in subsection )
it can be written as a Gaussian
state of the form
 
Here
 is a tensor product of 
invariant vacua from each Fock space,
 are annihilation oscillators bfaosc 
acting in the -th Fock space,
 is a twist
matrix and  are the Neumann matrices defining the
gluing vertex. The Neumann matrices
are symmetric or skewsymmetric

and
satisfy the cyclicity property .


For any string field theory matter vertex, the Neumann matrices
can be generated from a kernel operator
 
where the states are basisn . The expression
for the operator  can by obtained using
the conformal definition of the gluing vertex:
 
where  label the glued strings
and the maps  are defined below. This generalizes
 to arbitrary scale dimension .
When  is fractional we assume the principal branch of
the power function, in other words the branch cut is
on the negative real axis.
The
-function is needed to give a nontrivial  limit.
To be consistent with our scalar product norm 
we have put  as the second argument.
The second term proportional to  comes from the normal
ordering when one acts by two operators of weight  in the same
Fock space. When using a contour integral representation
for the Neumann matrices (as in) one never sees
this term: it simply gives zero contribution. In our calculations
this term cancels some divergences appearing in the diagonalization
of . Gross and Jevicki (paper 3, eq. (3.28))
also mentioned that the free propagator must be subtracted from .

To obtain an expression for the operator  it is enough
to notice that the twist operator  acts on the eigenvectors
 by changing the sign of the argument :
 
In other words to get an expression for  one
has just to change the sign of  in CMs :
 


Projecting with basisn  in MmnIJ  is equivalent to expanding
Mmaps  in  and , picking out the term 
and then multiplying
its coefficient by . (This last assumes
oscillators are normalized .)

Diagonalizing Witten's vertices 
Different string field theories use different maps .
For Witten's -string vertex
 
 
where , and
 
However we can diagonalize the -string vertex for very little extra
trouble. We therefore take
 
where  and .
Here  is a real number which is chosen
in such a way that all angles  lie in the
range . This last requirement is important because
we use rational powers in the definition of the Neumann matrix.
Then
 
As we saw in inner  the map  takes the unit disk into the
strip . The maps
 then transform this strip into 
 wedges, which are glued together by the Neumann matrices
.
Note that Mmaps  is homogeneous in the 's. The 
factors from hI  and kappas  always cancel against
the inner product inner ,
so homogeneity in  implies translation invariance under
, , and therefore
conservation of .

To diagonalize the -string Neumann matrix, we proceed as in id 
et seq. - first a binomial expansion of Mmaps , then a Watson-Sommerfeld
transformation. The final result is the same whichever way round
one does the binomial expansion. Thus if
,

,
where .
The contour  encircles the positive real axis counterclockwise
(see Figure ). Before deforming it as in Figure we must worry about the contour at infinity.
Starting from here we will consider  and  separately.

Matrices  for  

By cyclic symmetry we can fix , then .
In this case we can interpret  and therefore
* 
This guarantees that for 
 
After dividing by  we
get the following asymptotic behavior of the integrand
* 
as . Hence for  () the
integrand vanishes at infinity.
The poles of 
at negative integers are cancelled by zeros of ,
so for  we can shift the contour to  as in
Figure  by writing
 
to get
 
where
 
This displays the Neumann matrix as an outer product of 
eigenfunctions kappas . Notice also that the normalization
 introduced in As  is equal to .


Matrix  

If , the first term in M1J  contains a factor
* 
Either interpretation of 
will cancel the nice falloff of  in M1J 
and prevent deformation of the contour.
However in this case the second term in M1J  comes into play.
The bad asymptotic behavior at 
is closely related to the coincident singularity at 
coming from the vanishing denominators in Mmaps . Thus
* 
where  for the first term in M1J  and  for the second one.
Therefore the singularity at  cancels between
these terms and we can deform the contour as in Figure .

Notice that the second term in
M1J  differs from the identity kernel ws1  only by the
the factor . Therefore deformation of 
as in j2  for the first term and as in j1 
for the second term yields
 
where  is Bs  and  is
As . The asymptotic behavior is
 
so the contour at infinity cancels if we choose the same sign
in both terms.

Summary 
Here we present the results of the calculations performed in this
section. First we list the eigenvalues of operators
Mmaps  for general  and discuss their properties.
Second we present the results for  and certain values of .

-string Neumann eigenvalues 
The eigenfunctions have to be normalized by dividing by
 from As , so the Neumann eigenvalues are
 
 
where
 
The sign in MII  is undetermined. For  it makes
no difference. For  the "" sign agrees with
other authors.
From B/A  one easily obtains the recurrence formula relating  eigenvalues
for  and :
 
First, this shows that 
is not a continuous function at the point :
 
This discontinuity will be important in Section , when
we will analyze the spectrum of  Neumann matrices.
Second, from equation B/As->B/As+1  it follows that if
we first take the limit  then the
continuous eigenvalues M's   for
 and  coincide.

For , the products of -functions
reduce to hyperbolic ones. In this case B/A  takes
the following form
 
for  or  and
 
for .

Sliver and identity Neumann eigenvalues 

From MII  one can easily get the eigenvalue for
the sliver Neumann matrix 
 
Actually one can do even better. By MII 
 
For  one obtains
 
which agrees with (equation (3.22))
if we choose the "" sign in MII .


The identity state is a surface state mbra  determined by the map
h  for . In our notation it is .
Hence it can be represented as an exponential of  a quadratic form,
which is defined by Mmaps  for .
We will denote . The spectrum
of the operator  can be determined from
the general formula M's . For the special cases  and 
it is
 
The spectrum of the identity state for  agrees with that
found in (equation (3.21)) if we choose the upper
"" sign.

-string Neumann eigenvalues 
Finally we specialize to , abbreviating
 
In the following formulae we suppress the index  in
.
Then for  or ,
 
 
and for 
 

For , M10  exactly coincides with Rastelli et al.
. The sign ambiguity in MII  cancels for
 but not for . For ,
 in M1/2  agrees with
Marino and Schiappa
 if we choose the upper "" sign.

For  the continuous eigenvalues are the same as for the
case . This is in agreement with previous authors.
The improvement here is that we have much simpler expressions
for the eigenvectors as compared to.

In Section  we will consider
the zero modes more carefully. The continuum eigenvalues
are indeed identical for  and .
However there is
an additional discrete state at  whose
function is to replace the average position  by
the midpoint position.





 
The  basis 

The correct procedure for regularizing zero modes
goes back to the earliest days of string theory.
First note that for , id  becomes
* 
The divergence implements momentum conservation
 
and is an essential part of the representation.

Now consider the  oscillator. By Lnz  it has
frequency . We therefore define
 
to get
* 
which is the correct oscillator Hamiltonian.
By basisn  , so the zero
modes of the boson field become
 
which agrees with the usual expansion.

Next consider how the transformation  z'z  is
represented for . The matrix elements  are defined
by
* 
In other words
 
If both , the  limit is nonsingular.
Differentiation with respect to  of this equation for 
and comparison of the result with equation C_mn 
for the case  yields
 
 
The singular cases are
 
The  zeros cancel against  in a0 . The only
remaining divergence comes from the first term of  and
enforces momentum conservation by cons .


The  basis 
In the discrete basis, the infinite norm
state  is clearly separated,
and the  divergences are well defined.
In the  basis this is not so. The spectrum is
continuous and there is an infinite norm discrete
"eigenvalue" sitting on top of it at .
However, when we go to the second quantized world sheet
theory, these mathematical difficulties vanish.
Nevertheless we first present an heuristic first
quantized discussion, since otherwise the rigorous proof
would be hard to follow.

First quantized discussion 
As is well known, the  field  is
the derivative of the  field .
The  eigenfunctions basisn 
are related by
 
Notice that the singular eigenfunction  cannot
be obtained from   eigenfunctions.
Similarly the  eigenfunctions of 
 
can be integrated using
* 
to give
 
This is not quite an  eigenfunction of 
because the  singularity has been subtracted.
The subtracted piece has no  dependence and
therefore corresponds to  in the  basis.
This agrees with 228 . From equation kappaO 
it follows that the function 
has the following expansion in terms of 
polynomials 223 
 
Notice that the function 
is exactly the one found by Rastelli et al..


Now by 220 
 
As  the poles at  pinch
the  integral, making  very singular.
The square root in <mk>  may have arbitrary sign.
We choose 
always positive, and 
to have the sign of .
Hence the missing piece of kappaO  is
 
This completes the continuum wave function
 

However as in limits 
* 
so there is very likely to be a discrete state at  picking
up  terms. The easiest way to guess its wave function 
is to reverse the order of limits.
Taking  first, kappas  and As  yield
 
Now , so plausible
matrix elements with the  basis basisn  are
 
We renormalized 512  by requiring .
Just as in Tmn , the  in
scp  can cancel against  in a0 .
One can also derive scp  from the second term
in C3' , or by computing the residues at the pinching
poles in Figure , but none of these first quantized
derivations can be considered rigorous.


Second quantized eigenfunctions 
Our rigorous proof will start from a different  basis,
intermediate between  and . By id  and
218  the  Cauchy kernel is
* 
Integrating both sides, we get part of the 
Cauchy kernel:
 
Id _s0 (z,(2s)-(1-z=(2s)+_0^zd_0^ '
[1- ']^-2 


=0,s0,s+
_- ^ d,(z)
,(Here the first outer product is the  state from the 
basis basisn , and the integral is over the
outer product of kappaO . So if we add the 
zero mode to the continuum states kappaO , we get a complete
orthogonal basis for . The divergence is all concentrated
in the first term, so it is unproblematic. Of course,
it does not quite diagonalize , because
510  needs to be added to kappaO .

Now we consider the world sheet fields. In the notations
of 
so oscillators satisfying ,
and occurring in  multiplied by
 normalized  eigenfunctions basisn ,
are
 
 
If we differentiate X_L ,  are
multiplied by ,
so  are also (up to a
phase factor) normalized oscillators
for  with just a trivial index shift.
We can now put these together with the matrix elements
<mk>  to form continuum oscillators in the 
basis. For  the transformation is unitary, so
we get as in phipm 
 
satisfying
 
By 228  we only have to add an  term to get the
 continuum oscillators. By <mk> 
* 
Using 510  and  multiplying by 516a 
one obtains
 
The undefined term  cancels
from the commutator, so these are satisfactory oscillators in the
 basis.

Now we recall 514 . The first outer product is the zero mode from
the  basis. It corresponds to the oscillator
 of 516a . The second outer
product is the integrated   basis kappaO . It
corresponds to the oscillators  of
517 . The  integration just provides the .
So in this basis we can take the  limit simply by replacing 
by  and . Thus 514  implies that
 
form a complete orthogonal basis for the  world sheet
field theory. We need to replace  by
, but the extra term in 519 
can be added by a unitary transformation. Define
 
Then by 518 
 
 
To calculate , we insert 517  into
U  and do the integral by C5 , getting
 
Then
 
by X_L . This is just the position of the string's midpoint.
xi  also confirms the guess scp .
The oscillator corresponding to the discrete 
state is
* 
in analogy to 516a .

The unitary transformation U  cannot change
the commutators, so we conclude finally that  and
 form a complete orthogonal basis for
the  world sheet field theory with
 diagonal, and
 

The average  position  has been replaced by the midpoint position
. In view of the importance of the string midpoint in
Witten's string field theory, this is a very satisfying result.

Expansion of the world sheet field
in  eigenfunctions 
Lastly we expand  in these oscillators, assuming
that  is on the boundary of the unit disk.
Again we start with the basis 514 , where
the wave functions kappaO  give by 510 
 
By C1 
* 
or by kappaO  and 510 
) 
For  on the unit circle, 
, so by 519) 
* 
Notice that the oscillators were changed from 
to . The next step is to change  to .
To this end we substitute expression kappaO  for the function
 and split it into two terms by
changing  to .
* 
Now notice that the last term in the integral can
also be written by 519  as ,
i.e. the terms proportional to the momentum cancel.
Hence the last term can be integrated as in U   
Ud . Finally one obtains
 
This equation contains one subtlety: because
of the singularity in the oscillators 
the integral cannot be rewritten as a sum of two integrals
corresponding to creation and annihilation parts.
We emphasize that it is only valid for ,
corresponding to .





 

Zero mode vertex 
In this section we apply these zero mode fields to calculate the
 Neumann matrix.

Let  label the external lines. Then the 
vertex in the diagonal  basis is
 
Here  are the  annihilation oscillators
517  acting in the -th particle Hilbert space,
 are the eigenvalues M's 
for  or  and  is a twist operator, which
acts on the oscillators  as
 
We now include the momenta by
applying  copies of the unitary transformation
U . By Ass+1  this can be written
 
which can be normal ordered by C1 
 
Notice now that  contains
 in its definition 510  and therefore
it is even with respect to action of the twist operator .
Thus by 523a  and 519

The creation part of  converted 
to  as in 523a ,
while the annihilation part gave an extra diagonal piece.
The term in the first line and the integral in the second line
are singular. To show that the expression in the exponent is
meaningful let us rewrite it in terms of oscillators :

We see now that the integral in the first line is well defined,
however there are problems with the  limit in the other
two integrals.

Consider first the last term in VN:1 .
Notice the following integral of Bs  analogous
to C1 :
 
For  the integral in the last line of VN:1 
can be calculated by using
M's  and ABs  with the result
* 
where
 
For  one has to insert extra regularization
by multiplying by .
Once again the integral can be calculated by using ABs ,
and C1  for the subtraction term in MII 
* 
Hence the last term in the exponent is
 
The first term here is infinite. This is responsible for
the momentum conservation and after proper normalization of the vertex
 yields  as in cons .

Now we are ready to consider the second term in the
exponent VN:1 . Because of momentum conservation, we are at liberty to
include an extra factor
 
where  is an arbitrary constant. We choose
, since by N22N  and M's 
 
This turns  in VN:1  into .
After this substitution the  limit is easy.
Finally the  -string vertex in the 
diagonal basis takes the form
 
V_N^(0) p^I=(2)^26 (p^(1) ++p^(N) )

Notice that in principal one can omit  in the second
line of VN:CF .

For  the fact that the zero and nonzero momentum matter
vertices are related by a unitary transformation
agrees with.


Vertex in the  basis 
To compare the vertex VN:CF  with
 andwe first have to rewrite it in the discrete 
basis. Substituting the continuum oscillators
517  and <mk>  we obtain the following
expression for the -string
vertex mbra  in the momentum representation:
 
V_N^(0) p^(I) 26

where , and
 is a tensor
product of  Fock vacua  for the
oscillators  (), and
the matrix  is defined by
 
 
The sign in equation M':mn  comes from
the "" in the definition of the continuum oscillator
517 .
Notice that equation M':mn  up to sign
and obvious shift of indexes coincides
with the  Neumann matrix.

For  the representation M"  of the
momentum Neumann matrices in the -basis
coincides with that in (see Appendix B therein).

Check of Neumann matrix elements 
Lastly we check the  Neumann matrices
 against and.
Let us start from .
For  equation N:M'00  yields
 
which is in complete agrement with (paper 1).
For general  equation N:M'00 
gives the  matrix element, which
after taking into account momentum conservation
coincides with the result of(paper 1, equation (4.27)).


Next we check .
From equation M':0m  and <mk>  one obtains the following
integral representation
 
 
where  is by C5 
 
and corresponds to the discrete state scp .
Since  are polynomials
in , the integral in int1  can be calculated by
differentiating the following function (see M's )
 
which follows from the  limit limits 
of the derivative of ABs  with respect to .
This trick nicely works when . For  one
has to insert extra regularization by multiplying
the integrand in int1  by ,
then one can calculate the integral via BN2 
and  take the limit 
after the subtraction in MII .

For  the equation M'N  gives
(we suppress index )
 
 3 
1 2  M_02 ^12,13 &=-8 27 +1 3 =1 27 ,
&
1 2  M_02 ^11 &=5 54 -1 6 =-2 27 ;


1 4  M_04 ^12,13 &=112 729 -1 6 =-19 1458 ,
&
1 4  M_04 ^11 &=-167 2916 +1 12 =19 729 .
Here the first two numbers are from the corresponding
terms in M'N , while the third is from (paper 1,
equation (4.25)).
We also checked
. The usual Neumann
matrices are twisted, meaning that
elements with the first index odd change sign.
Allowing for this, we found complete agreement.
