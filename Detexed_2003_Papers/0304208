ABSTRACT 
We describe a supersymmetric example of the holographic duality
between 3 dimensional vector models and higher spin gauge theories in
, first proposed in a bosonic context by Klebanov and
Polyakov. We argue that a particular Fradkin-Vasiliev type
supersymmetric higher spin gauge theory in  with 16
supersymmetries is dual to the singlet sector of bilinear operators of
a free ,  vector model defined on the
boundary. Starting from the duality between type IIB on 
 with a D5-brane as an  subspace and the 4
dimensional  SYM with a defect, we recover the duality between
our vector model and the higher spin gauge theory. In this case, we
propose that the higher spin gauge theory is a truncation of the open
string theory on the world volume of the D5-brane in its tensionless
string limit. We also comment on a possible Higgs mechanism in our
model.

Introduction 

Recently Klebanov and Polyakov  have proposed that the
holographic dual of the singlet sector of bilinear operators of the
bosonic vector models should be certain bosonic Fradkin-Vasiliev
,   type
higher spin gauge theories in  spaces. In particular, they argued
that the 3-dimensional critical  vector model should be dual to
the minimal higher spin gauge theory in  which contains one
massless
 physical field for
each even spin 
. This duality has been motivated by the fact that the free 
 vector model for the real fields  in the
vector representation of :


S = 1 2  d^3x ^^a _^a 

has singlet bilinear conserved currents of the form


J_(_1 _s)  = ^a _(_1  __s) 
^a +  

which are primaries for . A prescription, similar
to that in the usual AdS/CFT correspondence, to find the correlation
functions of these currents from the higher spin theory has also been
proposed:


d^3x h_0^(_1 _s)  J_(_1 _s)  = e^S[h_0]  

where, as usual,  is the boundary value of the massless spin 
field in the bulk and  is the corresponding dual CFT operator. For
example, the massless scalar in  is proposed to be dual to the
spin zero 'current' . The well known infrared conformal
fixed point of the 3-dimensional vector model, in this language, is
nicely interpreted as the one obtained by deforming  by a
'double trace' operator .

It is of interest to understand this duality in more detail. Some of
the recent developments in this direction include
, , ,  .

In this paper, we consider supersymmetric versions of this duality. As
a particular example, we propose that the non-minimal 
higher spin gauge theory  in  based on the
higher spin superalgebra  should be holographically dual
to the singlet sector of bilinear operators of the free supersymmetric
3-dimensional  theory with fields in the vector
representation of .

It has been suggested in the literature that the Klebanov-Polyakov
(KP) duality should be realised as a truncation of the duality between
M-theory on  and three dimensional CFT on the
boundary in its free field theory limit. However, it is not yet clear
if and how the KP type duality can be realised in a string theory
context. Therefore, it is interesting to study any possible
realisations of such dualities in string theory. Here, we propose an
embedding of our supersymmetric version into type IIB string theory.

We start with the well known correspondence between a 4-d 'defect'
conformal field theory and the type IIB string theory on 
 plus a D5-brane with its world-volume embedded as an  
 subspace ,  . The D5-brane acts
as a co-dimension one defect in the boundary , ,
 SYM.  On the 3 dimensional defect, there is matter in the
fundamental (vector) representation of the gauge group . We
take a decoupling limit, the free field theory limit 
 of the defect CFT, that separates the 4-d
SYM dynamics from that of the 3-d vector model. In this limit the bulk
theory becomes that of the tensionless closed and open strings. By
taking recourse to a strong form of the AdS/dCFT duality, we argue
that the holographic dual of the singlet sector of bilinear operators
of the free vector model should be a consistent truncation of the open
string theory living on the D5-brane in the tensionless string
limit.

The paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we describe a
supersymmetric version of the KP duality. In section 3 we deal with
the subject of the string theory embedding of the duality of section
2. We also comment on how the higher string modes could become massive
through a generalised Higgs mechanism when  is turned on in
the defect CFT. In section 4 we give conclusions and open questions.

A supersymmetric version of Klebanov-Polyakov duality 

In this section we describe the holographic dual of a supersymmetric
Fradkin-Vasiliev type higher spin gauge theory in . We start
with a brief review of the higher spin gauge theory that we are
interested in. For a general introduction to higher spin gauge
theories of Fradkin-Vasiliev type, see  and for
more details of the particular theory being considered here, see
.

A non-minimal  higher spin gauge theory 
in . 

Let us consider the non-minimal  extended 
higher spin gauge theory constructed in .It is an
extension of the minimal  theory of
, ,  .  This theory is
defined in  background and is based on the higher spin algebra
. This infinite dimensional superalgebra contains


OSp(44) U(1)_f hs_0(44;1) 

as its maximal finite dimensional subalgebra. The spectrum of massless
Recall that in  the massless fields have  for
 and  for .  physical fields
of this theory, arranged into levels of  supermultiplets,
is given in the table below
:


 (l,j)  s    &&  && 0 &&  
1 2  && 1 && 3 2  && 2 && 5
2  && 3 && 7 2  && 4 && && && && && && && && && && && && (-1,1) && && 6 && 4 && 1 && && &&

&& && && && && 1 && 4 && 6 && 4 && 1 && && && && && && && && && && && &&  

Table(1): The higher spin spectrum based on the algebra
.  
The spectrum contains eight fields of each spin 
. At , we have an  SYM
multiplet and at the next level a supergravity multiplet and so on.

This spectrum is identical to the massless spectrum of higher spins
obtained as a tensor product ,   of two
Dirac singletons  of  superalgebra.


Spectrum [ hs_0(44;1)]  

where


= D(1 2 , 0; 1 2 , 0) D(1, 1 2 ; 0,
12 ) 

is the Dirac singleton. The infinite dimensional UIRs of the higher
spin algebra  are decomposed into those of  and
denoted by . The quantum numbers are those of
the maximal compact subalgebra


SO(2)
SO(3) SU(2)_H SU(2)_V OSp(44). 

One can set up the higher spin field equations  which
we will not reproduce here. At the level , the vector multiplet
has six scalars which are the lowest weight components of the UIRs
 and . Similarly,
the scalars at the next level are the lowest weight components of
 and . The rest of the fields have
 and all the 6s in the table above are made out of
 and all the 4s are made out of 
 of 
. The whole spectrum is neutral under  by
construction. Next, we construct a dual vector model.

The dual vector model 

We look for a ,  vector model with 
supersymmetry with the following properties. It should admit conserved
currents  (with  and 
) belonging to the singlet sector of
 and are bilinear in the fundamental fields. It should admit
 symmetry group. The conserved currents 
 should have the right quantum numbers of
 and neutral under  with multiplicities as the
corresponding higher spin fields listed in the previous subsection.

We have seen that the bulk field content can be obtained as a tensor
product of two Dirac singletons . Therefore, it is natural
to choose the field content of the boundary theory to have the same
quantum numbers as the lowest weight states of the singleton. That is,
a doublet of complex scalar fields , , and a
doublet of spinors , , both in the
fundamental representation of  with their conjugates
transforming in the anti-fundamental. The field content is summarised
below:


Field  && && Spin  (s) && SU(2)_H && 
SU(2)_V && SU(N) && U(1)_f q^m && 1 2  && 0 && 12  && 0 && N && 1 ^i && 1 && 1 2  && 0 && 1 2  && N && 1  

where  and  are the double indices of  and 
respectively. A free supersymmetric action with this field content can
be written down:


S_boundary  = d^3x [(^k q^m)^_k q^m - i
^i ^k _k ^i] 

where  are the Dirac matrices in . This free theory is
superconformal and admits  as its symmetry
group. Eight of its supercharges correspond to the ordinary
supersymmetries and the remaining eight generate superconformal
supersymmetries.

Following  let us construct a set of conserved currents in
this theory which are singlet bilinear operators and associate them
with the corresponding bulk fields listed in the previous
subsection.For details on the subject of higher spin conserved
currents in conformal field theories, see Refs. , 
, , ,  .  First, there 
are eight scalar () operators:


q ^m ^I_mn  q^n,      ^i ^A _ij 
^j,     q ^m q^m   and     ^i ^i 

where  is a triplet index of  and  is a triplet index
of .  and  denote the Pauli matrices. The
three scalars  () have
 and have the correct quantum numbers to be dual to three
of the scalars at level  in table (1). Similarly,
operators 
 correspond to the remaining three scalars in the 
SYM multiplet of the table (1). The remaining two operators 
 and  correspond to the scalars in the
 multiplet of table (1).

At , we have 


^i  q^m     and      q ^m ^i 

which are again eight in number and have the right quantum numbers to
be associated with the eight spin half fields appearing in table
(1). Let us now turn to the vectors. We find the following
eight conserved currents with :


q^m ^k  ^ ^    q^m,    
 ^i ^k ^i,     q^m
^I_mn  ^k  ^ ^    q^n
   and      ^i ^A_ij ^k ^j. 

We associate these currents with the eight vector fields in table (1)
with the appropriate quantum numbers.

In general, at any given integer spin  we can construct eight
conserved currents of the form


J ^_s (x ) = q^m
^_mn ^(k_1 
 ^ ^     
^k_2  ^ ^     
^k_s)  ^ ^    
  q^n + , 


J ^_s (x ) =  ^i
^ _ij ^(k_1 
^k_2  ^ ^     
^k_s)  ^ ^     
 ^j +  

where  with 
. Similarly, there are eight conserved currents for each
half-integral spin:


J _s^im  = ^i  ^(k_1 
 ^ ^     
^k_2  ^ ^     
^k_s)  ^ ^    
   q^m + , 


J  _s^im  = q ^m ^(k_1 
 ^ ^     
^k_2  ^ ^     
^k_s)  ^ ^    
   ^i + . 

Notice that these currents have the right quantum numbers of
 and are neutral under  as required. For more
complete expressions of these currents please see the
appendix.Notice that all the higher spin fields can be packaged
into the following set of bi-local collective fields in the sense of
refs: ,
,
 and 
 with 
. 

Thus we conclude that our free   vector model
 admits the right set of bilinear operators in its 
singlet sector that are in one to one correspondence with the fields
of the higher spin gauge theory of the previous subsection. Of course,
one needs to arrange these currents into supermultiplets which may
involve taking various linear combinations of the basic currents
listed above. 

One can easily generalise the precription Eq. of  to
evaluate the boundary correlators using the bulk higher spin theory to
our supersymmetric context. The procedure followed here can clearly be
generalised to construct the dual of any given higher spin gauge
theory whose field content is contained in the tensor product of its
Dirac singletons.

Let us now turn to finding an embedding of the model studied here into
a string theory context.

Vector models and tensionless open strings 

It has been conjectured in the literature that there exists an
unbroken symmetric phase of M-theory on  backgrounds
dual to an  invariant free singleton theory on the boundary. To
incorporate the Klebanov-Polyakov type dualities into this set up it
has been suggested (see, for instance,  and references
there in) that a massless sector of M-theory on 
should be dual to the singlet sector of  vector model. In
what follows, we argue that a more natural set up for realising a
Klebanov-Polyakov type duality is type II string theories in the
presence of D-branes.For discussions on higher spin theories
from type II closed strings, see
,
, , ,  .  We concentrate 
on the particular example discussed in the previous section.

As was outlined in the introduction, the set-up of interest is a
Karch-Randall compactification  of type IIB string
theory. That is, we embed a D5-brane into the the 
 background as an  subspace. This theory
is expected to be dual to a 'defect' CFT on the boundary generalising
the usual AdS/CFT correspondence . The details
of this duality along with a perturbative definition of the the dual
field theory have been worked out in
(See also ). We are going to use this duality
in an essential way. So let us first review briefly a few relevant
details of this duality.

The bulk theory 

The bulk side of this set up contains type IIB closed strings
propagating in the maximally supersymmetric 
background along with the D5-brane open strings propagating in the
 subspace. This system can be obtained by starting
with  D3-branes along  directions plus one
D5-brane along  directions (with both D3
and D5-branes sitting at the same point in 
directions) and then taking the near horizon limit of the
D3-branes. Before taking the large  limit, one has closed strings
along with open strings in the Chan-Paton sectors 3-3, 3-5 and
5-5. The 3-3 sector fields are in the adjoint representation of
, 3-5 strings in the bifundamental representation of 
 and the 5-5 strings contain a  gauge field. Taking
the near horizon limit separates the 3-3 and 3-5 strings from the 5-5
and closed strings.

The isometry group of the resultant background is 


SO(2,3) SO(3) SO(3) Sp(4) SU(2)_H SU(2)_V SO(2,4) SO(6). 

The latter is the isometry group of  without the
D5-brane. The presence of the D5-brane breaks half of the 32
supersymmetries of  and we have


OSp(44) SU(2,24) 

as the unbroken supergroup. There is also a  gauge field on
the D5-brane. The low energy description of this system is studied in
 and the modes are classified according to the
representations of . Since the supergravity and the DBI
modes are expected to survive the tensionless string limit, they will
be useful for our purposes later on. Let us review the relevant open
string results found in  here. For more details see section
3.2 of Ref..

There are three sectors for the light 5-5 open string modes:  The
angular fluctuation () of the D5-brane on ,  The
gauge field fluctuation () of the D5-brane along the 
directions and  two coupled sectors  of gauge
field components along  and the remaining transverse
fluctuations. Below, we summarise the spectrum of these fluctuations in
terms of their  energies (the conformal dimensions of the dual
operators):



(i)   & _+ = 2 + l,      _- = 1 - l, (ii)   & = 2 + l, (iii)   & ^(+) _= 3 2  1 2  (2l + 5),
   ^(-) _= 3 2  12  2l - 3.  

Here  labels the spherical harmonics over the  that the
D5-brane wraps, whose symmetry we denote by . The masses of
these modes are related to their conformal dimensions by the usual
relations. Notice that  is allowed only for ,
 is not possible at all and  is
allowed only for  by unitarity.Recall that the
unitarity in  requires the  for 
 and  for 
.  Under the  symmetry the vector  is a
singlet, the scalars  and  are a triplet and a
singlet respectively.

Further, for , the sectors  and  contain three
massless scalars (a triplet of ) and a massless vector
respectively. Similarly, the  sector contains
another three massless scalars at  (a triplet of
). There are also closed string supergravity modes which we
do not describe here. Beyond the low energy limit, there will be
higher stringy modes as well.

The boundary theory 

Now, let us briefly review the relevant information about the boundary
theory dual to the system described above. The intersection of the
D5-brane on the boundary of  is a co-dimension one
defect in the 4-d CFT. The defect carries, on its world volume, a
-dim vector model with one hypermultiplet in the fundamental
representation of the gauge group. 

Therefore, the boundary theory is a 'defect' CFT (or simply a
dCFT). This is expected to be a superconformal field theory with 16
supersymmetries. The symmetry group is again the superconformal group
 of which the  is the conformal group and the
 is the global R-symmetry. There is
also a  global symmetry under which the defect fields are
charged.This is the remnant of the fact that the defect fields
belonged to the sector of strings between D3 branes and a
D5-brane. The  is a gauge symmetry but  is only a
global symmetry after taking the near horizon limit.  A lagrangian
formulation of this theory is described in
. Here we will be content with describing the field content
of the theory and refer the reader to the original work for more
details. The 4-d ambient CFT (which we refer to as ) fields
are the vector  for , the scalars  and
 where  and  and the Majorana spinors
 where  and  are the doublet indices of 
and  respectively. All these fields are in the adjoint
representation of the gauge group . Further, we have the fields
on the defect: the 3-d scalars  and the fermions  which
are doublets of  and  respectively. Both these
fields are in the fundamental representation of the gauge group
. Notice that the quantum numbers of these fields are the same
as the ones given in Eq..

The operators dual to the light open string modes described in the
previous subsection are to be identified with gauge invariant single
trace operators made of the fundamental fields of the field theory on
the defect (which we refer to as ) and the adjoint fields of
 restricted to the defect.

A dictionary of such identifications can be found in section 5 of
Ref. which we reproduce below for later reference.

where, in the last column, we indicated the dual operators
corresponding to the lowest  modes which form a ,
,  SYM multiplet as expected from the supersymmetry
counting.The mode  is not listed above as it is
always massive and drops out of our story.  The dual operators for
higher  modes are also proposed in . For example:


C_l+1 ^I_0 I_l  = q ^m ^(I_0 _mn  X_H^I_1  X_H^I_l)  q^n - traces 

gives the operator dual to a mode with the  quantum number
 in the last row of .

The boundary theory is argued to be an exact CFT
,  . Therefore, one expects that the 
 embedding of the D5-brane is a solution to the
string equations of motion. We are going to assume that there exists
an exact world sheet boundary conformal field theory of this D5-brane
in  background. We will also assume that the duality
is valid in its strongest form for all values of the 't Hooft coupling
 and  and treat the field theory as a definition of the
dual string theory whenever necessary.

Having identified a type IIB string theory context in which the
3-dimensional field content  of the supersymmetric vector
model of section 2 is realised, we next aim to carefully extract the
vector model from the boudary theory and obtain its dual bulk theory
using the AdS/dCFT correspondence reviewed above.

Super KP from AdS/dCFT 

To summarise, on the bulk side of the duality there is the theory of
type IIB closed strings in  coupled to the open
strings on a D5-brane embedded as an  subspace. On
the boundary, we have the defect CFT. Holography tells us that these
two systems describe the same physics. Therefore, we write



& L ^(Bulk) _IIB Closed Strings  + L ^(Bulk) _D5-Open 
Strings  + L ^(Bulk) _Int.  
&           L ^(Bdy) _d=4, N  = 4, SU(N), SYM  + L ^(Bdy) _d=3, N  = 4,
SU(N) Vector Model  + L ^(Bdy) _Int.    

where we have denoted the theories by their Lagrangian densities
schematically. On the right hand side, the first two terms represent
 and  respectively and the third denotes the
interactions between them.

Since we are interested in singling out the vector model, we first
need to decouple both  and . Therefore, we seek a
limit of the boundary theory in which the term 
 can be dropped. This indeed happens in the limit
 where  is the 't Hooft
coupling on the boundaryFor this limit we keep  to be large
but finite and take .   and 
 in the bulk. In this limit, both 
 and 

 become free field theories and the 
interaction lagrangian  goes to zero. On the
bulk side, the limit  is the tensionless string
limit.In a strict large  limit one expects that 
 also should go to zero. But we will be interested
in keeping higher orders in .  Therefore, in this limit, one
expects that the whole string spectrum to become massless with
infinitely many states at each spin.

Now that we have decoupled the  and , we can in
principle, extract the holographic dual of the vector model of 
 alone. But unfortunately we do not have much handle over the bulk
side of the story. Therefore, we take recourse to indirect arguments
based on the assumption that the strong form of the AdS/dCFT is true.

First we restrict ourselves to single trace operators of the boundary
theory. The calculable quantities of interest in the CFT are the
correlation functions of gauge invariant operators. In the limit
, these operators are simply the singlets of
. There are essentially three classes of these singlet
operators. Denoting an arbitrary adjoint field of  by 
 and a fundamental field of  by  these
operators, schematically, are of the type:


(a)     Tr  (A  A ),   
   (b)   F   A  A  F ,   
  (c)   F  F  . 

The operators of type  correspond to the closed string
states. The operators of type  and  (in general,
combinations of those, like in Eq.(3.4)) correspond to the open string
states.There is, in general, operator mixing with multitrace
operators which is crucial at higher orders in perturbation
theory. Here, we mean the operators which reduce to the ones listed in
 at the lowest order in the perturbation theory. 

We are interested in the vector model and therefore in the correlation
functions involving type  operators alone. Hence we need to
'subtract' the  from the boundary theory. At the level of
correlation functions, this amounts to setting all the operators
belonging to type  and  to zero which is achieved by simply
setting the fields of the  to zero. This is consistent
because we have decoupled  and  completely. 

By 'subtracting' the  from the boundary theory, we are left
with a much reduced set of operators (those of type ) on the
boundary theory. Let us try to infer what this truncation of the set
of operators of the boundary theory means for the bulk theory. Using
the strong form of the AdS/dCFT correspondence, we conclude that
setting type  operators to zero amounts to setting all the dual
closed string states on 
 to zero. Similarly, setting type  operators to zero
corresponds to truncating the spectrum of tensionless open string
states consistently.

More specifically, out of the spectrum of the light open string modes
discussed in section (3.1) (all of which survive the tensionless
string limit) we will be left with only the lowest  modes after the
truncation. This is because the operators dual to any higher  mode
contains powers of adjoint fields of  (like in
) which we set
to zero as they belong to type  of . Thus, we get rid
of all the higher KK modes of these light states in this
truncation. About the higher string modes we again go back to the dual
theory. For this we simply note that the free field theory that we
obtain in the limit is exactly the one we considered in section
2. There, we constructed all the operators that could be dual to the
string states that we are after. Therefore, we expect that the
truncated spectrum of the tensionless open strings on 
 should be identical to the spectrum of the higher spin 
gauge theory on  discussed in section 2.

In other words, the higher spin gauge theory considered in section 2
is precisely the consistent truncation of the tensionless open string
theory. The truncation is achieved by subtracting the  
from the AdS/dCFT correspondence that we started with. The symmetry
group  is now simply the superconformal group of the 3-d
vector model and the  is now associated with the  gauge
field on the D5-brane. The neutrality of the higher spin spetrum of
section 2 under  is simply the reflection of the fact that the
open string states on a single D-brane are neutral under its 
gauge field. However, if we had more than one coincident D5-branes,
the corresponding higher spin spectrum would have been charged under
the the non-abelian gauge field on the branes.

It may be puzzling that the gravity theory expected for holography is
now actually part of a tensionless open string theory living on a
D5-brane. However, one expects a graviton (a massless spin two
particle) in the open string spectrum in the tensionless string
limit. One way of arguing for this is to look at the conserved
energy-momentum tensor of the dual boundary CFT :


T_ (y , x) = T _  (y , x) + (x)
_^k _^l t_kl (y ) 

where,  and  are the coordinates along and transverse to
the defect. Neither  nor  is conserved by
itself in the full theory. In the free CFT limit, however, they are
both conserved individually. Since in this limit  is quadratic
in the fields of the , it corresponds to an open string
mode. Hence, we expect that one of the stringy modes of the 5-5 sector
to become massless exactly in this limit and play the role of the
graviton dual to this conserved energy momentum tensor.This was
also noticed recently in .  Notice that there are eight
spin 2 fields in the higher spin spectrum of table (1). But we expect
that the actual graviton dual to the 3-d energy momentum tensor is a
combination of the spin 2 states in the second and fourth rows of
table (1) as the others do not have the same global quantum numbers
 as .

Before concluding this section, we comment on the possibility of
understanding how the higher open string states of the higher spin
theory could attain masses once we go away from the decoupling limit
discussed above.

The open string graviton and the higgs mechanism 

For consistency we expect that, when  is turned on, all the
fields except for the massless  SYM multiplet (at level
 in table (1)) acquire masses proportional to the string
tension. From the boundary theory point of view, this means that the
operators dual to these states develop anomalous dimensions


- s - 1 O  () 

In the full interacting dCFT, one can see this happening in
perturbation theory ,  . From the bulk theory point
of view, once we turn on the tension of the strings, we can no longer
neglect interactions with closed string modes (and the rest of the
open string modes which we set to zero by the consistent truncation
explained above). But it may be possible to argue that the extra
massless modes acquire mass for nonzero  in the higher spin
theory in . A related issue has been considered in the
literature  (see also
) for .There is, however,
an essential difference between  and our case. In
, Higgs mechanism for the the bulk (closed
string) graviton was considered (a la  Karch-Randall
brane-world ). We are interested in the open string
graviton.   In Ref. it has been argued that depending
on the boundary conditions set for the massless scalar, the graviton
goes through a Higgs mechanism to acquire mass. By simply noting that
the required mixing of boundary conditions occurs precisely when the
defect interacts with the ambient CFT, we can take over the results of
 into our context.

Massless UIRs of  group with spin  have 
and massive ones have . A massive UIR 
 becomes reducible in the massless limit 
. For example, for a spin  massive UIR in 
denoted by  one has the decomposition


D(, s) D(s + 1, s) D(s + 2, s - 1) 

in the limit . The first piece on the r.h.s
is massless and the second is a massive representation. This implies
that in  a spin  field must eat a massive particle of spin
 to attain mass. Generalising this result to our case, the
decomposition of a massive representation  in
the limit of 
 may be written as :


D(, s, j_1, j_2) D(s+1, s, j_1, j_2) D(s+2, s
- 1, j_1, j_2). 

This gives the quantum numbers required for the Higgs fields. One
should be able to find these representations in the tensor product of
the scalar field representations of table (1) as explained in
. We postpone a more detailed analysis to the future.

Conclusion 

We have provided a supersymmetric example of the holographic duality
between vector models and higher spin gauge theories first considered
by Klebanov and Polyakov  in a bosonic context. Our bulk
theory is a particular non-minimal  higher spin gauge
theory in  and based on the algebra 
. It contains eight physical fields at each
spin . The holographic
boundary theory is a 3-dimensional   free vector
model. Since our method is based on constructing the field theory
using the singleton representations of the higher spin algebra, it
should help constructing other examples where the higher spin field
content is contained in the tensor product of the corresponding Dirac
singleton.

We have suggested that the model studied here can be embedded into
type IIB string theory. We have argued that the bulk theory should be
a truncation of the open string theory on a D5 brane, embedded
as  subspace of  background of
type IIB, in its tensionless string limit. The truncation is
understood from the boundary theory point of view simply as the
'subtraction' of the free .

It is amusing that a large  CFT is dual to an open string theory as
opposed to a closed string theory. The role of the graviton is
expected to be played by a massive open string mode which becomes
massless in the tensionless string limit. One could consider variants
of the model described in this paper. For example, taking an
orientifold of the model considered here, where one replaces 
 by , should result in an 
version of our duality. One can use the notion of consistent
truncation to get to the minimal bosonic higher spin gauge theory
based on  algebra as explained in
. Similarly, with an  analogue, one would
end up with the proposal of Klebanov and Polyakov itself via
consistent trucation.

One could have started with more than one (say ) coincident
D5-branes in . This should lead to a  valued
higher spin spectrum. Such higher spin theories have been considered
by Vasiliev .

It would be interesting to study the tensionless limit of open string
theory side explicitly based on the recent results
, , ,  . Also, it may be 
possible to understand the higher spin spectrum considered here as
that of a 'brane' in an appropriate higher spin gauge theory in
. The spectrum on  subspace may perhaps be thought of as
the goldstone and goldstino modes of broken higher spin symmetries of
a corresponding  theory. Related ideas have been considered
recently in . We note that we only tested the duality that
we proposed here at the level of matching the spectra. However, the
way we 'derived' it from a string theory context suggests that even
the interactions of the higher spin theory considered should be
reproducible from the dual modes. It will of course be interesting to
check this explicitly. One may also be able to define the bulk theory
in terms of the bilocal collective fields (see the footnote 4) as in
. Finally, we have not considered the possible 'double
trace' deformations of our free theory theory. The allowed set of
boundary conditions for the scalars in the bulk suggests the existence
of other (interacting) CFTs . It should be interesting to
explore that aspect as well. We hope to return to some of the open
questions in the future.

A The conserved currents 
In this appendix we provide more detailed expressions of the conserved
currents listed in section 2. We closely follow
Refs. , , , ,
 .

We seek conserved tensor primary current of the free field theory of a
complex scalar and a spinor in  given in . More complete
expressions of the ones indicated in section 2 are as follows:


(J ^(q q) _s)^= _k=0 ^s
(-1)^k (_i_1  _i_k  q ^m)
^_mn  (_i_k+1   _i_s  q^n)
(k+1) (s-k+1) (k+ ) (s - k + ) 
 - traces, 


( J ^() _s )^= _k=0 ^s-1  
 (-)^k (_i_1  _i_k   ^i) ^ _ij 
_i_k+1   (_i_k+2   _i_s  ^j) 
(k+1) (s-k) (k+ 3 2 ) (s - k + ) 
- traces. 

In the above expressions  and all the indices
 are understood to be completely
symmetrised. Further, as stated earlier, the indices  take
four values  and the corresponding
 with  being the 
 identity matrix and  being the  Pauli
matrices. For each spin , we have a total of eight
currents. Similarly, the half-integer spin currents are given as
follows:



( J ^(^ q) _s )^m_i &= _l,n,p
=0 ^  (-1)^l ( p + l + n + 3 2 ) (l+1) (n+1) (p+1) 2^p (p + l 
+ 3 2 ) (p + n + 3 2 )  
& [ (p + n + ) _s-l-n-2p-  _i_1i_2  
_i_2p-1 i_2p   _i_2p+1   _i_2p+l  
^j_1  ^j_p  ^i  & _i_2p + l +1   _i_p+l+n   _j_1 
_j_p  q^m & -_s-l-n-2p -3 2   _i_1i_2  
_i_2p-1 i_2p   _i_2p+1   _i_2p+2   _i_2p+l+1   ^j_1 ^j_p  _i_2p+l+2  
^i  & _i_2p+l+3   _i_2p+l+n+2   _j_1 
_j_p+1   q^m ]
  

and finally there is another set of currents obtained by 
 and  in the expression
. Again there are  currents with half
odd-integral spins as required for the model considered in section 2.
