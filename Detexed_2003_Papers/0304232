We construct a manifestly  invariant,
supersymmetric extension of the closed string cubic interaction vertex and dynamical
supercharges in light-cone string field theory on the plane wave space-time.
We find that the effective vertex for states built out of bosonic creation
oscillators coincides with the one previously constructed in the
 formalism and conjecture that in general the two formulations
are physically equivalent.
Further evidence for this claim is obtained from the discrete
-symmetry of the plane wave and by
computing the mass-shift of the simplest
stringy state using perturbation theory.
We verify that the leading non-planar correction to
the anomalous dimension of the dual gauge theory operators is
correctly recovered.

Introduction 

The maximally supersymmetric pp-wave space-time  (henceforth referred to as the plane wave)
 
provides an interesting and tractable example of a curved background with flux on which many aspects of (type IIB)
string theory can be studied.
In particular, in the Green-Schwarz formalism, the world-sheet action is quadratic in light-cone gauge and hence can be
quantized exactly . The spectrum of the closed string consists of a unique massless ground-state  and an
infinite tower of excited states whose masses are of order  , where
 
 is the light-cone momentum.
An important aspect of the plane wave is that it can be obtained as a
Penrose-Gu ven limit  of  .
This allowed  to derive a duality between string theory on the plane wave and a double-scaling limit of
  super Yang-Mills (SYM) from the AdS/CFT correspondence .
The latter can then be studied, albeit in a special limit, beyond the supergravity approximation due to the solvability of
string theory in this background.

The Penrose limit induces the following relations between string and gauge theory parameters   
where  is the conformal dimension and  the charge of a  subgroup (corresponding to a  inside the  that is
singled out by the Penrose limit) of the  -symmetry of SYM. The composite (BMN) operators with large charge  and conformal
dimension  whose difference  remains fixed in the double scaling limit
 
are the field theory duals of perturbative string states . For these operators the quantity  is a function
of the effective coupling   and the effective genus counting parameter
  (see also ). Subsequently the gauge theory side
of this novel duality has been extensively studied, see
e.g. 
.

String interactions in the plane wave space-time correspond to the non-planar sector (i.e. finite ) of interacting gauge theory,
cf. dict . In light-cone gauge in flat space-time string interactions can be studied using the vertex operator approach. The
difficulties associated with the fact that  is quadratic in transverse coordinates can be circumvented exploiting the
ten-dimensional Lorentz-symmetry. In the plane wave this is broken by the flux, in particular there is no  generator, and the
study of interactions is more involved. On the other hand, the light-cone string field theory formalism
developed in flat space-time for the bosonic string (see e.g. )
and extended to the superstring in  was successfully generalized to the
plane wave for closed
strings  and
for open strings .
In light-cone string field theory the cubic interaction vertex is a first order in  correction to the free Hamiltonian.
In the bosonic string it is constructed by requiring continuity of string fields on the world-sheet;
in the number basis continuity is enforced mode by mode by an exponential of creation oscillators.
In the superstring additional 'dynamical' constraints arise from the requirement that the superalgebra is realized in the
interacting theory; hence the dynamical supercharges that anticommute to the Hamiltonian have to acquire corrections as well.
These additional constraints on the interaction vertex (and dynamical supercharges)
are solved by introducing prefactors, polynomial in creation oscillators, acting on the exponential part of the vertex.
In the functional formalism these prefactors have the interpretation of interaction point operators .

Light-cone string field theory has been used to perform a successful test of the duality
beyond the free string/planar gauge theory level in , where
the leading non-planar correction of certain BMN
operators  was reproduced from a string field
theory computation (see also ). For further aspects of string interactions and
the duality to SYM see
e.g. .
In spite of this success there remains a puzzle concerning the correct approach to light-cone string field
theory on the plane wave background. Whereas used the  formalism to construct the cubic interaction vertex and thereby closely followed the flat space-time
approach , an alternative and apparently different construction
(called the  formalism in what follows) was initiated
in , where the continuity conditions were solved.
The difference in the two formulations lies in their starting point: in the  formalism the vertex is built on the
state  (with energy ) that is not the ground state of string theory on the plane wave, rather it corresponds to the
dilaton/axion fluctuation mode of plane wave supergravity . Then, by construction, one has a smooth connection to
flat space-time string field theory as . On the other hand,
in the  setup, the vertex is built on the vacuum 
of plane wave string theory, which corresponds to the fluctuation mode of a mixture of the trace of the graviton and the potential
on one of the two transverse 's .
The presence of the flux breaks the transverse  symmetry of the metric to , where
the discrete  is a particular  transformation that exchanges the two 's (cf. planewave ).
Based on this  symmetry it was argued in  that only the  formalism
yields a vertex which respects the complete transverse symmetry. In this paper we attempt to resolve this puzzle by solving
the dynamical constraints in the  formalism. With the complete solution for the cubic interaction vertex and dynamical
supercharges at hand, we find strong indications that both  formulations preserve
all the transverse symmetries and propose that they are physically equivalent.

This paper is organized as follows. In section  we briefly review the free string
and recall the solution to the continuity conditions in the  formalism. In section  we
present the solution of the dynamical constraints, i.e. the prefactors both of the cubic interaction vertex and dynamical
supercharges. In section  we use these results to compute the leading order (for large ) mass-shift of the simplest
stringy state using perturbation theory and truncation to the so called impurity-conserving channel. We conclude in section .
Several appendices are also included: in appendix  we summarize our notations and conventions, appendices and  contain details on the derivation of the prefactors and appendix  provides the functional expressions for
the fermionic constituents of the prefactors.


Preliminaries 
The free string 

The free string in the plane wave background in
light-cone gauge is described by  and  in position space or
by  and  in momentum space, where  is a transverse
SO(8) vector index,  is a SO(8) spinor index. The index  denotes the th
string. The bosonic part of the light-cone action in the plane wave background is  
where , ,  and
.
In a collision process  will be positive for an incoming string and negative for an outgoing one.
The mode expansions of the fields  and  at  are
 
The Fourier modes can be reexpressed in terms of creation and annihilation operators as
 
Canonical quantization of the bosonic coordinates yields the usual commutation relations
 
The fermionic part of the light-cone action in the plane wave is  
where  is a complex, positive chirality SO(8) spinor and 
is symmetric, traceless and squares to one.
The mode expansions of  and its conjugate momentum  at  are
 
The Fourier modes satisfy 
and the canonical anti-commutation relations for the fermionic coordinates yield the anti-commutation rules
 
The fermionic normal modes are defined via  
and break the  symmetry to . Here
 
These modes satisfy
 
In what follows it will be important to use a -matrix representation for which the
 symmetry
of the plane wave space-time is manifest for the fermions. In this basis
 
where ,  (, ) are two-component Weyl indices of , see appendix  for our conventions.
Hence 
project onto  and  of ,
respectively, and
 
The free string light-cone Hamiltonian is
 
In the above the zero-point energies cancel between bosons and fermions. The vacuum  is defined as
 
We will sometimes suppress the spinor indices and go back and forth between expressions which are formally  invariant but
contain  and those where the  symmetry is manifest.

The isometries of the plane wave superalgebra are generated by , , ,
 and . The latter two are angular momentum generators of the transverse  symmetry
of the plane wave space-time. The 32 supersymmetries are generated by ,  and , .
The former correspond to inhomogeneous shift symmetries on the world-sheet ('non-linearly realized' supersymmetries), whereas the
latter generate the linearly realized world-sheet supersymmetries.
An important subset of the superalgebra is  
The supercharges, obtained by the standard Noether method in , are
 
and .
Expanding  in modes one finds
 
where
 

The kinematical part of the vertex 

The guiding principles in the construction of light-cone string field theory are world-sheet
continuity and the realization of the superalgebra in the full interacting theory. One can distinguish two
sets of generators. One consists of the kinematical generators
, , , , ,  and 
which are not corrected by interactions, in other words the symmetries they generate are not
affected by adding higher order terms to the action. On the other hand, the dynamical generators
,  and 
do receive corrections in the presence of interactions. The requirement that the
superalgebra is satisfied in the interacting theory, now gives rise to two kinds of constraints: kinematical  constraints arising
from the (anti)commutation relations of kinematical with dynamical generators and dynamical  constraints arising from the
(anti)commutation relations of dynamical generators alone. The former lead to the continuity conditions
in superspace, whereas the latter require the insertion of interaction point operators .
In practice these constraints will be
solved in perturbation theory, for example , the full Hamiltonian of the interacting theory, has an expansion in the string coupling
 
and  leads to a three-string interaction. Then it follows that e.g.
 
so the interaction vertex is translationally invariant and conserves transverse momentum (which is not a good quantum number in the plane
wave space-time due to the confining harmonic oscillator potential). This constraint is the same as
world-sheet continuity in momentum space and will be realized by constructing an interaction vertex which
conserves  locally . Analogously the fermionic world-sheet continuity condition follows from
 
and will be implemented by local conservation of , cf. Q+ .
In practice it is useful to express e.g.  not as an operator, but as a state
 in the multi-string Hilbert space and work in the number basis . Then the dynamical
generators are of the form ,
where  are the prefactors determined by the dynamical constraints (i.e. the oscillator expressions of the interaction point
operators mentioned above) and the kinematical part of the vertex  common to all
the dynamical generators implements the continuity conditions. In the number basis it has the form
 
where  and  are exponentials of bosonic and fermionic creation oscillators,
respectively.
The bosonic solution to the kinematic constraints is  
where  is the tensor product of three (bosonic) vacuum states and 
are the so called Neumann matrices, see e.g.  for their formal definitions and for explicit expressions as functions of , .
A solution of the fermionic kinematical constraints built on 
(instead of  , cf. the discussion in the introduction)
is (To compare with the expression in , note that
)  
 
where the non-vanishing components of the fermionic Neumann matrices are  (, ; no sum
over  in q2  and we use the notations of )
 

A supersymmetric extension in the  
 formalism 
The superalgebra and the constituents of the prefactor 

It is convenient to define the linear combinations of the free supercharges ()
 
which satisfy
 
The anticommutator  is in fact only satisfied on the subspace of physical states obeying the
level-matching condition  (see also the recent ).
Since  and  are not corrected by the interaction,
it follows that at order  the dynamical generators have to obey
 
Rewriting these constraints in  notation,
each gives rise to four constraints, e.g. dyn1  yields
 
with the fourth constraint equivalent to the third one.
So as not to destroy world-sheet continuity, the prefactors have to (anti)commute with the kinematical constraints.
The relevant bosonic combinations that are linear in creation oscillators are
 
where
 
and . For the explicit expressions of  and  see e.g. .
The fermionic expressions anticommuting with the kinematical constraints that are linear in creation oscillators are
(see also )(There exist further expressions anticommuting with the kinematical
constraints , which however can be written as  and , cf. appendices  and .) 
 
where
 
and we have chosen a normalization convenient for what follows.
In order to derive equations that determine the dynamical
generators one has to compute (anti)commutators of  and 
with the constituents of the prefactors. Moreover, the action of the supercharges on
 has to be known in terms of these constituents.
To determine the equations arising from the constraints dyn1  and dyn2  we
will need
 
Furthermore
 
Finally, the action of the supercharges on  is
 
These equations can be written in  notation, the resulting formulae are relegated to appendix .
It is useful to note the reality properties under complex conjugation defined as
 
which enable us to immediately write down the solution for , once we
determined .

The dynamical generators at  

To construct a solution to the dynamical constraints we will proceed as follows: first
we write down an ansatz for, say , which is of the form
 
where  and  are the most general polynomials in
 and  compatible with the index structure. Computing the left-hand-side of
equation 1  and requiring that the result only
contains the tensor  fixes all the coefficients
except for the overall normalization and analogously for 2 ;
the relative normalization between
 and  is fixed by demanding that the
right-hand-sides of 1  and 2  result in the same cubic interaction vertex.
Finally, one can check that 3  is satisfied with these fixed coefficients.

To determine the most general ansatz for the fermionic polynomials we define the following
quantities which are quadratic in  and symmetric in spinor indices
 
cubic in 
 
and, finally, quartic in  and antisymmetric in spinor indices
 
where
 
These quantities satisfy various useful relations given in appendix B, id1 -id4 .
Analogous definitions are made for .
Performing the above procedure (cf. appendices  and  for details) we
find the following solution for the dynamical supercharges
 
) 
Here we defined
 
and the spinorial quantities, say for 
 
The remaining dynamical supercharges are , some details for the proof
of the remaining constraint dyn3  are given in appendix .
The cubic interaction vertex is
 
where(The first line can also be written as 
)  
 
Here we defined
 
and analogously for the primed indices. Notice that
,  and
 only
yields a contribution quartic in  and .

From the purely bosonic part of the prefactor it is manifest
that it has negative  parity under the discrete  symmetry
of the plane wave space-time. Indeed, taking the overall normalization (which cannot be fixed by the dynamical constraints) to be
, the effective interaction vertex for
states containing only bosonic oscillators is
 
In the second equality we have used an identity derived
in . The effective vertex is identical 
to that obtained in the  formalism (there one has to take into account an
expectation value of fermionic zero-modes, see e.g. ).
In particular it follows that we have to assign negative -parity to the vacuum states 
if the solution we have found should preserve all the transverse symmetries of the plane wave. Then, the vertex in the 
formalism preserves all the symmetries as well, since the parity of  is positive. In  it was
proposed that the parity of the plane wave vacuum  should be positive in order to obtain an interaction vertex
in the  formalism that preserves
the  symmetry. Then the vertex of would break the -symmetry.
This proposal however, was based on the assertion that the constant part of the fermionic
prefactor is
 invariant. Now that we have solved the constraints we see that this is not the case and, therefore, the full transverse
symmetry is preserved in both  formulations.
Further evidence for the above assignment of parity can be extracted from earlier literature:
the spectrum of type IIB string theory on the plane wave was analyzed in detail
in , in particular the precise correspondence between the lowest lying string
states and the fluctuation modes of supergravity on the plane wave was established.
As mentioned in the introduction, the state  corresponds to a complex scalar arising from the
dilaton-axion system, whereas the state  corresponds to a complex scalar
being a mixture of the trace of the graviton and the potential
on one of the 's, i.e. the chiral primary sector. Since the dilaton and axion are scalars under  and
the discrete  is just a particular  transformation, the
assignment of positive parity to  appears to be the correct one. Moreover, analysis
of the interaction Hamiltonian for the chiral primary sector shows that invariance of the
Hamiltonian under the  requires the chiral primaries to have negative
parity .

It is therefore natural to conjecture that the two apparently different formulations for light-cone string field theory
are physically equivalent. In the next section we will present additional evidence for this claim
by computing the leading order mass-shift of the simplest stringy state
and showing that at leading order in large  the torus anomalous dimension of the dual
gauge theory operators is again reproduced (as in the  formalism ).

We know that the vertex of  reduces to
the one in flat space when .
It is quite plausible that even in
flat space one could construct a solution to the constraints starting with any  state in the
massless multiplet, e.g. in  the closed string cubic interaction vertex
was constructed in the  formalism, where only a  subgroup of the
transverse  symmetry is manifest.
In flat space the most natural approach is the  formalism,
since there the maximal transverse symmetry is manifest. In the plane wave however, there are two natural choices: to have
a manifest flat space limit (and therefore to be able to work with quantities that are
formally   invariant) or to have the true transverse symmetry manifest, but give up
the smooth connection to the flat space vertex of the  formalism; both approaches have their advantages,
e.g., as we will see in the next section, it is simpler to compute
correlators with fermionic oscillators in the formalism presented here.

Note that our reasoning implies that the recent solution to the dynamical constraints given in , which is
of the form , is only  but not  invariant.
It would be nice to understand the origin for the successful tests of the vertex-correlator duality reported
in  given the fact that the 'phenomenological' prefactor proposed in does not agree with the result found here (nor with the one of ).

Anomalous dimension from string field theory 
In this section we compute the mass-shift due to interactions of the simplest stringy state
(The
change of basis 
for  is for convenience.) 
 
using non-degenerate perturbation theory. In principle one should use degenerate perturbation theory as the
single string state can mix with multi-string states having the same energy.  The same caveat
holds for the computation in gauge theory and we will ignore this complication here.
In the  formalism this has been done for the symmetric-traceless  and
antisymmetric  of
either one of the 's in  and for the trace 
in . Here we repeat this computation in the 
formulation constructed in the previous section and also extend the
analysis to the (We define the states in  
as .) 
of . These
correspond to BMN operators with mixed scalar/vector impurities and
superconformal symmetry of the gauge theory implies that they
have the same anomalous dimension as the other representations .

At lowest order the eigenvalue correction comes from two contributions; one-loop diagram and contact term
 
Factors different from  in the normalization (cf. heff ) are absorbed in the
definition of  and , the extra factor of  in the first term is due to the reflection symmetry of
the one-loop diagram.  The sum
over ,  is over physical double string states, i.e. those obeying the
level-matching condition and for the case at hand
 is the only relevant contribution to the quartic coupling.
As the generators are hermitian we take the absolute value squared of the matrix elements
(also for the contact term after inserting a suitable projection operator).
Time-reversal in the plane wave background consists in
the transformation
 
in particular the reversal of  is needed due to the presence of the flux.
Up to now we have always assumed
that  is non-negative and , , . This is, say, the process where a
single string splits  into two strings.
One can show that for the process in which
two strings join  to form a single string, i.e. ,  and , one should make the additional replacements
 
in all expressions.
This is in agreement with
equation tr . Notice that the
transformation of  is needed to leave the fermionic mass term invariant.
From the formal expressions for the Neumann matrices it is not manifest that the cubic corrections to the dynamical generators are
hermitian as they have to be. However, from the explicit expressions for the Neumann
matrices  one can see that
all the quantities are in fact invariant under the time-reversal.
The string states obey the delta-function normalization
, where
 for the ,  for the 
and  otherwise.
The sum over double string states includes a double integral
over light-cone momenta, one integral is trivial due to the string-length conservation of the
cubic interaction and the factor of  can be cancelled on both sides of
equation de1 .
The remaining sum is then the usual completeness relation for harmonic
oscillators projected on physical states and we have ()
 
The measure arises due to the fact that string states are delta-function normalized.

It is important to note that in gauge theory the dilatation operator was diagonalized
within the subspace of two-impurity BMN operators in perturbation theory in
the 't Hooft coupling 
and then extrapolated to , .
But it is not obvious that the large  limit of the perturbation series in  has to
agree order by order with the perturbation series in , see for
example .
Indeed there is evidence from string theory that this is not the case.
For large  the denominator of the first term in equation de2 
is of order  in the
impurity conserving channel, whereas it is of order  in the
impurity non-conserving one. However, as already noticed in ,
matrix elements where the number of impurities changes by two are of
order  and, therefore potentially can contribute to the mass-shift at leading
order, that is . Notice that impurity non-conserving matrix
elements being of order one, means actually  and as the overall
factor of  is simply for dimensional reasons and should not be counted when
translating to gauge theory, implies contributions
 to matrix elements of the dilatation operator.
It was observed in  that the contribution of
the impurity non-conserving channel to de2  is linearly divergent.
This is due to the fact that the large  limit does not commute
with the infinite sums over mode numbers;
for finite  the divergence is regularized. So a linear divergence reflects
a contribution  and hence of order
 to the anomalous dimension. This constitutes a non-perturbative, 'stringy'
effect.
It remains a very interesting challenge to
investigate the contribution of the impurity non-conserving channel in detail.
In principle, it is possible that besides a divergent contribution there is also a finite
one; this
would then scale as . However, to reproduce the gauge theory result
for the anomalous dimensions of two-impurity BMN operators in string theory one is led to
a truncation of equation de2  to the impurity conserving channel .
This analysis will be performed below.

Contribution of one-loop diagram 

The matrix element  in the impurity conserving channel
is non-zero only if the double string state contains either two bosonic or two fermionic
oscillators. The relevant projection operator is (for brevity written in  form)
* 
where the sum over ,  and ,  is understood. We get the contribution of the
first line 'for free': since the effective vertex for bosonic oscillator states is the
same as in the  formalism, we can use the results
of . Using the large  expansions for the bosonic Neumann
matrices  one finds, for example for ,
 
and the analogous expression for  with an (inessential) overall minus sign.
Here
 
can be split into a symmetric-traceless and a trace part.
There is no contribution to the  nor to . The sum over  and the integral over  can
be done and the complete contribution of the impurity conserving channel with
bosonic excitations at one-loop is
 
The factors of  and 
equal the normalization  of the string states.
Thus the contribution to the  and  is in both cases  
The second case with two fermionic oscillators in the double string state was not analyzed in and is quite tedious in the  formalism. In the formulation used here the computation is comparable to the
one with bosonic oscillators.
This time the bosonic contribution including the normalization is for large 
 
This is automatically symmetric in  and . In particular,
only the symmetric  part of  (and ) can contribute.
In this case we have e.g.
 
and, therefore, there is no contribution to the representations  and  as the sum over  is vanishing.
There is a contribution to
the representation :
the relevant matrix element with fermionic oscillators is ()
 
Taking the large  limit and summing all the contributions we find
 
giving the same contribution as for  and .
(We have also checked this in the  formalism.) 

Contribution of contact term 

To have a non-zero contribution from  the intermediate states need
to have an odd number of bosonic oscillators and an odd number of fermionic oscillators. Thus
the simplest contribution comes from the impurity conserving channel.
In this case the projector is
* 
Including the normalization and taking into account that we already absorbed the string-length conserving delta-function  is
 
and the fermionic contribution is again rather trivial. The bosonic expectation value for large  has been
computed in  so we shall not repeat it here.
Taking into account all the contributions, doing the sum over  and integral over  results in
 
for the antisymmetric  and  and
 
for the ,  and .
Summing the contributions of one-loop and contact diagrams
we see that all (bosonic) two-impurity irreducible representations of
 get the same contribution to the mass-shift from the
impurity-conserving channels
 
This is in exact agreement with the gauge theory
result of .

Conclusions 
In this paper we have presented a supersymmetric extension of the cubic interaction
vertex and dynamical supercharges with the manifest  symmetry
of the plane wave space-time. We have argued that this solution provides an
equivalent formulation to the previously known one in the  formalism.
Our arguments were based on the discrete  symmetry of the plane wave, the equivalence of the effective
interaction vertices for states containing only bosonic creation oscillators in both formulations and, finally, the agreement
of the leading order mass-shift for the simplest string states.
It would be nice to find an exact proof of this conjectured equivalence and
understand the relevance of the solution recently given in .
