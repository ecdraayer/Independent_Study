Four-Point Function with One Independent Angle 

In order to evaluate the path integral for the partition function
of open strings stretching between D-branes intersecting at an
angle  we split the embedding fields 
into a classical solution to the equation of motion, subject to
the appropriate boundary conditions, and a quantum fluctuation.
The mode expansion for the quantum fluctuation is not integer
moded due to the boundary conditions. The vacuum of the  CFT
is then created by primary fields  acting on the
 invariant vacuum. The partition function
naturally factorizes into a classical contribution due to
worldsheet instanton sectors and a quantum amplitude due to
quantum fluctuations.  In contrast to the instanton contribution,
the quantum amplitude contains no topological information about
the worldsheet embedding in target space, but it is still
essential for the complete determination of Yukawa couplings in a
general model with intersecting branes.

Evaluation of Quantum Amplitude 

  We shall employ
 the stress tensor method   to evaluate the quantum amplitude of
four twist operators. For oriented theories the twist operators
live on the boundary of the disk and change the boundary
conditions as we move along the boundary. The boundary conditions
are specified by the D-brane configuration in target space (See
Fig. ). We concentrate on a single  and
D1-branes wrapping one-cycles. The amplitude for branes wrapping
factorizable three-cycles on  is then the product of the
amplitudes for the three  factors.

In terms of the complexified coordinates
 on  the boundary conditions
read bc 
X+ X =0,
X + X=0,on 
(-,x_1)(x_2,x_3)(x_4,+) 
 e^i X+e^-i  X =0,
e^-i X +e^i  X=0,on  (x_1,x_2)(x_3,x_4). These conditions define
the OPEs of the embedding fields with the twist operators, namely
X(z)_(x)(z-x)^

X (z)_(x)(z-x)^- 
  X(z )_(x)z -x)^- 
  X (z )_(x)z -x)^and similarly for . To evaluate the correlation
function of four twist fields
 we
consider the correlators g(z,w)=-1 X(z)X (w)_(x_1)_- (x_2)_(x_3)_- (x_4) 
    _(x_1)_- (x_2)_(x_3)_- (x_4) 
    h(z ,w)=-1  
X(z )X (w)_(x_1)_- (x_2)_(x_3)_- (x_4) 
    _(x_1)_- (x_2)_(x_3)_- (x_4) 
    g (z,w)=-1 X (z)X (w)_(x_1)_- (x_2)_(x_3)_- (x_4)

X (z )X (w)_(x_1)_- (x_2)_(x_3)_- (x_4) 
    _(x_1)_- (x_2)_(x_3)_- (x_4) .
    The OPEs () together with the conditions     g(z,w)(z-w)^-2 , h(z ,w)    regular as  uniquely determine     g(z,w)=_1- (z)_ (w)[(1-)(z-x_1)(z-x_3)(w-x_2)(w-x_4) (z-w)^2 +.

        _(z)=(z-x_1)^- (z-x_2)^- (z-x_4)^    Here  and  are functions of the twist field
    positions to be determined. The boundary conditions and
    holomorphicity imply     h (z,w)=-g(z,w), g (z,w)=-h(z,w).     
 
  

[]World sheet contours. The contours  and
 (Figure 3a) are the two topologically inequivalent contours
leading to two independent conditions. The contours in Figure 3b
define the global monodromy conditions used in Section III.  

    In
    order to determine the functions  and  we
    impose appropriate monodromy conditions which will ensure that
    the quantum fluctuations  are local. This is
    guaranteed if _C_i dX=_C_i dX =0where
     is any non-trivial worldsheet contour. In the case at
    hand there are two topologically inequivalent contours 
    joining the intervals  and  and
     joining the intervals  and  (See
    Fig. a). One can save some effort, however, by noticing that the contours can be analytically
    continued to the worldsheet boundary along which only one
    particular linear combination of target space fields satisfies
    Neumann boundary conditions and can therefore have non-trivial
    displacement (along the boundary of the world sheet   and
    hence the fields satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions
    give no contribution). The non-trivial conditions are     _C_1 d(e^i X-e^-i X )=0     _C_2 d(X-X )=0. Correspondingly
    the correlation functions  and  must satisfy         _C_1 [e^i g(z,w)-e^-i g (z,w)]=0    _C_2 [g(z,w)-g (z,w)]=0.     Invoking
     invariance we fix 
. Dividing then by
     and letting  we get     g(z,w)[(z-x)+A(x)] _1- (z)     g (z,w)B(x) _ (z)where
     and  have been redefined appropriately to absorb
    the singularity arising from  and      _(z)=(z-x_1)^- (z-x_2)^- .    Conditions () and ()
    give
    two linear equations for  and  which can be solved to
    obtain A(x)=12 x(1-x)_x[F(x)F(1-x)]    where F(x)   B(,1-)F(,1-;1;x)=_0^1dy
    y^- (1-y)^- .

    extracted from the OPE    T(z)h_ (z-x)^2 +1 z-x _xZ_qu (x)+    as . Evaluating the left hand side by taking the
    limit  in the expression
        T(z)w    z (g(z,w)-1 (z-w)^2 )=A(x_i) (z-x_1)(z-x_2)(z-x_3)(z-x_4) 

    +12
    (1-)(1 (z-x_1) +1 (z-x_2) +1 (z-x_3) +1 (z-x_4) )^2.    we obtain
        Z_qu (x)=_x_4 x_4^(1-) _(0)_- (x)_ (1)_- 
    (x_4)    const.  [x(1-x)]^(1-) [F(x)F(1-x)]^1/2   .     Evaluation of Classical Contribution 

    The path integral over the target space fields  includes
    a sum over topologically inequivalent configurations from
    strings wrapping around the compact directions of the torus.
    The main contribution comes from configurations  satisfying the
    classical equations of motion while the effect of fluctuations
    about these classical configurations is encoded in 
    and was calculated in the previous section using conformal
    field theory techniques.

    In this section we first determine the
    classical configurations satisfying the equation of motion subject to the boundary
    conditions (), dictated by the D-brane setup. This is a straightforward boundary
    value problem for the Laplace operator in two dimensions and the
    solutions can be expressed in terms
    of holomorphic or antiholomorphic maps from the disk onto the
    target space manifold. We then evaluate the on-shell action
    and sum over the toroidal lattice to obtain the world-sheet instanton
    contribution to the four point function.

    The solutions to the above boundary value problem are         X(z)=a_1- (z)a e^-i  _1- (z)
      
    X (z )=-a_1- (z )a e^i  _1- (z )
         X (z)=b_ (z)b e^i( _ (z)
      
    X(z )=-b_ (z )b e^-i( _ (z )    where the coefficients  and  are the only free
    parameters to be determined. These parameters reflect the freedom in specifying the length of
    the two independent sides of the parallelogram. The classical contribution to the path integral is then
    Z_cl =e^-S_cl   where     S_cl =1 4C _+ d^2z(X X +X  X)

        =-1 4a ^2+b ^2)    where we have used     _C _+ d^2z _(z)^2=_C _+ d^2z _1- (z)^2=2()F(x)F(1-x).    To determine the coefficients  and  we
    impose the monodromy conditions(We assume for simplicity that the branes wrap
    cycles along the two-torus lattice vectors.)       _C_1 ds=2n_1R_1 () ,_C_2 ds=2n_2R_2 Since
     along      ds^2=(dX^1)^2+(dX^2)^2=(dX^1 () )^2.    Similarly,  along . A similar calculation
    as for the quantum monodromy conditions then gives     a =i(n_1R_1 ()F(x) +n_2R_2 F(1-x) )

        b =i(n_1R_1 ()F(x) -n_2R_2 F(1-x) ).    Hence,     S_cl = n_1R_1 ()F(x) )^2+
    (n_2R_2 F(1-x) )^2].The full amplitude  is now of the form:
 
where   is determined in () (up to an overall
 and     is defined in ()).


 Note, in  the limit
         _m_1,m_2 e^-S_cl (m_1,m_2) 1and hence the
    four twist amplitude receives no instanton corrections as expected.

Canonical Form of the Amplitude and Generalizations 
The above   calculation was performed for the
 amplitude of two intersecting branes wrapping two canonical homology cycles  and , respectively
 of  the  with the complex structure specified by . We can however reexpress this amplitude
 in  terms of a four-point twist amplitude for two branes wrapping  two general cycles  specified
 by the wrapping numbers  and  on   with
 the trivial complex structure, first, as:
 Zo 
     Z(x)=const.[x(1-x)]^-(1-) [F(x)F(1-x)]^-1/2 

          _r_1,r_2  r_1L_1 F(x) )^2+
    (r_2L_2 F(1-x) )^2].Where  are the lengths of the corresponding one-cycles and
can be expressed in terms of the wrapping numbers and the radii of
the torus as: .
  On the other hand  can be reexpessed in terms of
    invariant quantities such as the intersection number 
    and the lengths  of the
    one-cycles  as     ()=I_12 R_1R_2 L_1L_2 =I_12  n_1^2+^2 m_1^2 n_2^2+^2 m_2^2  where  is the
    complex structure modulus.  As expected the angle is insensitive to the overall scale, and depends only
    on the wrapping numbers and the complex structure modulus.


It is  straightforward to generalize this result to a  with a
non-trivial complex structure . In this case it is efficient
to parameterize the  wrapping numbers in terms of 
  (see for example). The
complete result takes the form (), but with 's
replaced with .



Of course a generalization of the amplitude to the case of
 (we assume the Kahler structure to
be a product of the Kahler structures of each ) is
straightforward.  In this case each twist field  is just a product
of individual twist fields for each , and the four-twist
amplitude is a product of individual twist amplitudes ().
The most interesting examples where the above calculations can be
applied  are cases of Type IIA string theory on 
 with intersecting D6-branes wrapping a product of
three one-cycles associated with each .

 For that purpose of performing complete string amplitude calculations it is instructive to
  write down the complete  vertex operator for physical  bosonic states   and   which
  in
 the (-1) conformal ghost  () picture(Here for clarity we have denoted the bosonic antitwist
 operators by  modifying the notation  which was used before for the same operators.) :
  
  where   corresponds to the bosonized world-sheet fermion  (worldsheet super-partner of the i-th toroidal
  coordinate ). Here we chose to write explicitly the  complete vertex
  operator for the bosonic states in four-dimensions; they  appear
  in the internal space
  at the intersection of D6-branes wrapping a product of
  three one-cycles  on .


In the case of  supersymmetry  the  intersection angles  satisfy
the condition  which
ensures that these vertex operators  correspond  the massless
bosonic states, which now become superpartners of  massless
fermionic states with the following (-1/2) superconformal ghost
picture vertex operators:
 
 Note that in the case  of supersymmetry the vertex operators ()  for
 and  have the   worldsheet charge 
,  and , respectively and thus correctly
represent the vertex operators for the bosonic component of the
chiral superfield and its complex conjugate, respectively
. Similarly, the
worldsheet charge  for the fermionic vertex operators
() are  respectively  and ,
again in accordance with  worldsheet supersymmetry
representing the fermionic components of the chiral superfield and
its complex conjugate, respectively.

In the above expressions we have suppressed the Chan-Paton
factors, however they are straightforward to incorporate. The
states transform as    under the 
 gauge symmetry of the two intersecting branes (see, e.g.,
 for details).



 The  orientifold projection of Type IIA theory
 involves along with the  world-sheet parity projection also the  mirror symmetry projection, say along
 the horizontal -plane of  . Note that  this projection restricts
 the value of  to be either  or 
. Since each brane now also has an orientifold image, obtained
by a map ,  one can
now consider  four-amplitudes of   states appearing at the
intersection of a brane, denoted by i, and another one, denoted by
, that is an orientifold image of a brane denoted by j. Note
that the calculation of the four-amplitudes proceeds analogously
as above. It is possible to calculate the four-point amplitude of
the states  appearing at the intersection of, say brane , with
its own orientifold image .   Such states can appear as
symmetric or anti-symmetric representations of the  (for
details see). Again, calculation proceeds along the
same lines.








In the following we shall determine the crucial  normalization
 of the quantum part of the correlation function.



Normalization of the  Amplitude 


    The overall normalization of the four-point amplitude can be
    determined  by factorizing the amplitude in the limits  or  in which the
    four-point amplitude reduces to  a product of the two three-point
    amplitudes. Namely in these limits, the four-point amplitude
    
    
    
    
     contains a dominant  contribution from the exchanges of the
    intermediate open string winding states around the compact
    directions.  In the effective field theory description the
    zero winding states correspond to the exchange
    of gauge bosons living on the brane along the cycle which is not collapsed by
    the limiting process. As  brane 2 contributes while as
     brane 1 contributes.


For the sake of concreteness we shall focus on a four-dimensional
example with D6-branes wrapping a product of three-cycles. The
physical states at the intersections are represented by the vertex
operators  () and ().
    For that purpose we shall evaluate the  four-point disk
    amplitude     of  two   bosonic states
     and two  
    at the intersections. We shall relate this
    amplitude to  the product of two three point functions   of
      and     states, and the gauge boson  via the unitarity condition:
   


With these preliminaries  we now proceed with the calculations of
the physical string  amplitudes.   The three-point amplitude takes
the form:
 
This is the standard three point amplitude, since   we have taken
into account that 
, and that in the picture changing procedure
of the gauge-boson  vertex the internal part of the fermionic
stress energy tensor does not contribute.  We have introduced the
disk coupling  and the coupling  of each vertex
operator. The additional factor of  is due to
the picture changing procedure of the   gauge field vertex. The
gauge-field  polarization vector is denoted by . (For
simplicity we calculated the amplitude only for  gauge
field;  generalization to  is straightforward.) The
factorization of the four-point gauge boson amplitude onto the
product of two three-point gauge boson amplitude yields the
standard relationship between  and : 
.   Note that this relationship also automatically
ensures that on both sides of () the dependence on 
drops out; namely .

We have chosen  which allows one to write the
effective kinetic energy action for the gauge fields with the
pre-factor  and the  kinetic energy for the 
fields to be canonical. Here   is defined in terms of
the full gauge coupling for the specific brane as(See,
for example, Vol. II, eq. (13.3.25).) :
 
Thus the unitarity condition () appears with an extra
factor  on the right-hand side  (RHS) of the
equation.

When evaluating the four-point amplitude we chose to picture
change the vertex operators for both   fields, which in turn
ensures that there is no contribution from the internal part of
the  fermionic stress energy contribution. The upshot is the
following form  of the amplitude:
 
where the  is the four-twist amplitude defined  in ()
with  while  are the Mandelstam variables.

In order to compare the LHS and RHS of  ()  and thus
determine  we shall evaluate the amplitude  () in
the limit  first. As ,  and

, where 
 and 
. Therefore, to take the limit  we must
    do a Poisson resummation over .
    
    
    This gives
        Z(x)=2L_2 const.  ()  [x(1-x)]^-(1-) F(x)^-1 
     _m_1,m_2 F(1-x) F(x) [(    m_1L_1 22m_2L_2 )^2
    1 () ]
     2L_2 const. ()   x^-(1-) 
    _m_1,m_2 (x  )^[
    (m_1L_1() 22m_2L_2 )^2]    
   
   
   
   
   
   
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

The pre-factors  from each of
 the the  contribution combine precisely into
  for brane 2 (see eq.()).
 Therefore the  contribution of  on both sides of eq.
 () cancels.
Evaluating the four-point amplitude near  yields a pole
associated with -channel exchange of the corresponding gauge
field. Equating the LHS and RHS  of () in turn then
determines: 

The  limit  gives a  contribution from the  channel
exchange of gauge bosons   associated with  brane 1. In this case
the resummation is over   in () which again
 factorizes to  associated with brane 1 in the four- point amplitude
  () and  thus cancels the same gauge coupling contribution
  on the RHS of (). Of course the rest of the calculation is consistent with
 the values of   in  ().

 Generalization of the Lattice Summation 

 In the amplitude () we assumed that the four twist
 fields were coming from the same  intersection and therefore the
 summation over all possible parallelograms reduced simply to a
 sum over multiples of the lengths,  and
 , of the two cycles the branes wrap. We would like to generalize this amplitude
 to four twist fields coming from more than just one intersection.

 First let us consider the correlation function of a
 twist-antitwist pair from intersection i and a twist-antitwist
 pair from intersection j. Obviously, the fields coming from the
 same intersection must be separated by a lattice translation and
 therefore the distance between them is again a multiple of the
 length of one of the two cycles, namely  or . However,
 the minimum distance between fields from different intersections
 is not zero. In particular, it depends on the total number  of
 intersections between the two branes and the lengths of the
 one-cycles they wrap as we show next.

 By translating the one-cycles by all possible lattice vectors in
 the covering space  of  one observes that along
 one complete cycle each fixed point appears only once and that
 the one-cycle is divided into  equal intervals of length
 , where   stands for either  or  depending on the cycle under consideration.
 Therefore, the minimum distance between two different
 intersections is generally an integer multiple of  or
 . One must first decide on the labelling of the
  intersections. There are obviously two evident but
 equivalent labellings, namely, we can index the
 intersections in increasing order, starting from 0, along cycle 1 or cycle 2. Let us, for concreteness,
 label them along cycle 1. The
 minimum distance between intersections i and j on cycle 1 is then obvious, but the minimum
 distance between the same intersections on cycle 2 is not
 because the intersection points are ordered differently along
 this cycle. So one must first determine how the fixed points are
 ordered along the second cycle.

 To this end consider the cyclic group of order , namely
  Z _I_12  e,c,c^2,,c^I_12 -1 c^I_12  =e where  is the generator of the group. To each fixed point we
 can uniquely associate an element of this group by the rule  jc^jIt can then be shown that the
 ordering of the fixed points along cycle 2 is given by the
 automorphism   gg^k,gZ _I_12  where k is an integer between 1 and 
 which depends on the wrapping numbers of the two cycles. For this
 map to be an automorphism obviously k must not divide 
 for then the map is not injective. A general expression for k as
 a function of the four wrapping numbers has proved difficult to
 find so far apart for special cases of wrapping numbers. We
 emphasize that whatever this expression might be it must
 guarantee that k does not divide . Until
 such an expression is known one can always determine this number
 k by drawing the cycles in the fundamental domain of the torus. k
 is given by the fixed point closest to 0 along cycle 2 (see
 Fig.).

 
 
  

[]The fundamental domain for a brane with wrapping
numbers (3,1) (solid line) and a brane with wrapping numbers (1,2)
(broken line). There are five intersection points labelled in
increasing order starting from 0 along the solid brane. Starting
from 0 and moving along the second brane (broken line) one meets
first fixed point 2. This is the integer k that generates the
automorphism () in this example.   
The four-point function with twist fields from intersections i and
j gets contributions from the two lattice configurations in Figure

fixed points i and j along cycles 1 and 2 respectively, the

[]The two configurations for a twist-antitwist
pair at intersection i and a twist-antitwist pair at intersection
j. Both configurations must be included in the string amplitude.  

The summation of these two lattice contributions in the case of
i=j gives the two terms in the amplitude (). For
distinct i and j, however, there is no t-channel massless exchange
since twist fields from different intersections do not couple.
This can be seen explicitly from the string amplitude. As 
or  only one of the terms  gives a massless exchange after
Poisson resummation. In particular, for the   limit one
needs to do a Poisson resummation in  to see that only the
second term survives in this limit. The first term, which contains
, goes to zero even for  in this limit.
Analogously, only the first term contributes in the 
limit.

To determine the overall normalization of the amplitude we proceed
as in the previous subsection. Instead of two s-channel poles and
two t-channel poles from gauge bosons living respectively on brane
1 and 2, we now get in the amplitude () just two
s-channel poles, one for each type of gauge bosons. The
normalization constant is still given by equation (),
however.

One can ask if similar results hold for four-point amplitudes of
twist fields coming from more than two intersections. Clearly an
amplitude of a twist-antitwist pair from intersection i with a
twist from intersection j and an antitwist from intersection k is
not possible since the fields coming from intersection i must be
separated by a lattice translation which forces k=j. However,
four-point amplitudes of fields coming from four different
intersections are possible. In this case there will be a minimum
non-zero distance between each pair of twist fields which will
depend on the particular brane configuration. At most one lattice
configuration exists for a given set of twist fields all coming
from different intersections. The necessary and sufficient
condition for a non-vanishing amplitude of two twist fields from
intersections i and j and two antitwist fields from intersections
k and l is i-k=l-j. Such amplitudes do not contain massless
exchanges though and so their overall normalization cannot be
determined directly by the above method. Nevertheless, this
normalization constant is part of the quantum amplitude, which is
independent of the global effects of the lattice, and hence it
must be also given by ().




Four and three-point functions with two independent angles 

The above method can be directly applied to the problem of a
four-point amplitude with two independent angles
(Fig.).  The boundary conditions now read
bc1 
X+ X =0,
X + X=0,on 
(-,x_1)(x_2,x_3)(x_4,+) 
 e^i X+e^-i  X =0,
e^-i X +e^i  X=0,on  (x_1,x_2)
 e^-i X+e^i  X =0,
e^i X +e^-i  X=0,on  (x_3,x_4)
 In the appendix we evaluate the quantum amplitude
 .
 The result is Z_qu (x)=    const. x^-(1-) (1-x)^- I(x)^-1/2 where     I(x)(1-x)^1-    ].. is the Euler Beta function and
    ,  are Hypergeometric functions defined in the
    appendix.

     From the boundary conditions () we determine the classical
    solutions          X(z)=a_1-,l(z)a e^i( _1-,l(z)
      
    X (z )=-a_1-,l(z )a e^-i( _1-,l(z )
         X (z)=b_,1-l(z)b e^-i  _,1-l(z)
      
    X(z )=-b_,1-l(z )b e^i  _,1-l(z )    Again the parameters  and  are arbitrary and reflect the freedom in specifying the lengths  and  of the
    four-sided polygon. However, to obtain a three-point amplitude one must take the limit  . Unless
    , which is precisely the case of one independent
    angle considered above, one of the two linearly independent solutions becomes singular in this limit. For , as we will assume
    without loss of generality,
    
    develops a non-integrable singularity at  in the limit
    .  Therefore, the four-point amplitude that reduces to the three point amplitude
    must have . This is to be expected since the distance  cannot be an independent parameter if one wants
    to get a three-point amplitude. In fact if   is set to zero  becomes a function of  and  which tends to zero as  as required.
    To keep the discussion general though we first consider the problem with arbitrary  and .


    The classical action is given by     S_cl =-1 4a ^2_C _+ d^2z _1-,l(z)^2+b ^2_C _+ d^2z _,1-l(z)^2]
    =
 -I(x) 4a ^2+(1-x)^-2(1-b ^2]where the integrals have been
    evaluated using the method of to
    factorize closed string amplitudes into product of open string
    amplitudes. To determine the coefficients  and 
    we impose the global monodromy conditions
    _C'_1 dX^2=d_1,_C'_2 dX^2=d_2where the contours  and
     are shown in Figure b.
     The two other lengths of the polygon are
    automatically determined and no other contours provide any additional
    information(Note, however, that these two conditions become linearly dependent when  because . In that case, which is the problem of one independent angle discussed earlier, one should take the contours of Fig.a.) .
    Solving these conditions for  and
     we obtain a =i[
    (1-x)^-(1-    and
    b =i[
    B(,)F_1(1-x)d_2+(1-x)^(1-    where J(x)    (1-x)^-(1-(1-    Although the general four-point amplitude with arbitrary 
    and  is interesting itself, we want to evaluate the
    three-point amplitude which gives the instanton corrections to the Yukawa
    couplings.  then must be set to zero and the monodromy
    conditions give instead     a =id_1 B(,)F_1(1-x) while 
     is
    -dependent     d_2(x)=d_1(1-x)^1-B(1-,1-)F_2(1-x) B(,)F_1(1-x)     0as  which therefore correctly produces a
   three-point amplitude in this limit. The on-shell action becomes     S_cl =I(x) 4d_1 B(,)F_1(1-x) )^2    and the complete four-point amplitude takes the form     Z_4(x)=const. x^-(1-) (1-x)^- I(x)^-1/2 _mI(x) 4d_1(m) B(,)F_1(1-x) )^2.    Here  is the most general form the distance
     can take when the polygon is embedded in a lattice.
     and the cycle length  will generically depend on the lattice and the
    D-brane configuration. The overall normalization constant can be determined by the same method
    used to fix the normalization of the four-point amplitude with one independent
    angle. We specialize to  since the amplitude of most interest is the one
    involving factorizable three-cycles on . We find     const. =16^5/2 .    The limit  of the four-point
    amplitude produces the full expression for the three-point
    amplitude. In particular, since , the latter
    contains the correct singularity in this limit in agreement
    with the operator product expansion     O _i(z_1)O _j(z_2)_kC_ij ^kO _k(z_2)(z_2-z_1)^h_k-h_j-h_i .    One can then show that the full three-point amplitude for branes wrapping factorizable three-cycles on  takes
    the form
    Z_3=2_j=1 ^34B(_j,1-_j) 
    B(_j,_j)B(_j,1-_j-_j)  _mA_j(m) 2    2_j=1 ^34(1-_j)(1-_j)(_j+_j)  (_j)(_j)(1-_j-_j)  _mA_j(m) 2    where  is the area of the triangle formed by the three
    intersecting branes on the j-th torus. Note that the amplitude is completely
    symmetric in all three angles of the triangle as it should.

    A comprehensive analysis of the triangles that contribute to
    this amplitude for a given set of intersections in diverse brane configurations and
    including the effect of non-trivial complex structure or Wilson lines has been
    done in.

    conclusions 

    We have applied conformal field theory  techniques to obtain three-point and
    four-point correlation functions of twist fields from
    D-branes wrapping  factorizable n-cycles of  and intersecting at points
    in  the internal .  The method allows for a complete
    determination of the amplitude including the quantum
    contribution.  Its most interesting  application  is to
     the three-point function  calculation of intersecting D6-branes wrapping factorizable
     three-cycles of , which in turn gives
    the complete  Yukawa coupling of  four-dimensional two chiral
    fermions  to the Higgs field.

  The method also applies to the study of the
     three-point and four-point
    twist field correlation functions in models with orientifold
    and orbifold projections, as discussed in Subsection II C.  Due to the mirror symmetry projection
    along an -plane in  the branes can now
      intersect with an orientifold image of another brane.
      However the amplitude calculation for states at the
      intersection proceeds analogously.
      As for the  orbifold projection, we mention that the combined orbifold and orientifold action maps cycles into
themselves; thus each intersection is accompanied by  a
combination of the  orientifold and orbifold images that have to
be carefully taken into account. We hope to return to the detailed
discussion of these contributions in the future work.

    
    
    
    
    

    The formalism   can  be applied to the calculation of three and four
    fermion couplings of  classes of  Type II   orientifold   compactifications  with
    intersection D-branes.  Among them the  four-dimensional Type IIA orientifold compactification
    with intersecting D6-branes is interesting; supersymmetric compactifications of this type are directly
    related to  compactification of M-theory. In addition to the Yukawa couplings,
     the four-point amplitude of chiral fermions can
    provide low energy corrections to the effective four-fermion
    coupling
    and may be of phenomenological interest.  We plan to
    address further  these effects in concrete
    semi-realistic N=1 supersymmetric models such those
    constructed in, e.g.,
   .

Evaluation of Quantum Four-Point Amplitude with Two
Independent Angles 

 Here we evaluate the four-point correlation function
 .
 The calculation closely parallels the calculation for closed
 string amplitudes on orbifolds.
 As before we introduce the auxiliary correlators ,
 ,  and 
 as defined in section II.A. In terms of     _,l(z)=(z-x_1)^- (z-x_2)^-l(z-x_4)^ these take the form  g(z,w)=_1-,l(z)_,1-l(w)(P(z,w) (z-w)^2 +A(x_i)) h(z ,w)=_,1-l(z )_,1-lB(x_i) where
 P(z,w)=_i,j=0 ^2a_ij w^iz^j and the condition  g(z,w)(z-w)^-2 determines all coefficients 
 except for ,  and  for which it provides
 two linear equations. Solving these for  and 
  we find T(z)w    z (g(z,w)-1 (z-w)^2 )
    =A(x_i)+z^2+a_21 z+a_20  (z-x_1)(z-x_2)(z-x_3)(z-x_4) 

    +12

    -( (z-x_1) +1- (z-x_2) )
    (1-l(z-x_3) +l(z-x_4) )    where . The
    freedom in  does not affect the final result since
     will be determined after  is fixed.
    Fixing      a_20 =12[(1-+)x_1x_3+(1-    and using  invariance to set 
 we find     _x Z_qu (x)=    12(1-x-1 -(1-) x -(1-)(1-) x-1 +A(x) x(x-1)     where     A(x)=_x_4 -x_4^-1 A(x_i)    and
        Z_qu (x)=_x_4 x_4^(1-) _(0)_- (x)_-l(1)_l(x_4)    As before  is determined by imposing the quantum
    monodromy conditions     _C_i dX=_C_i dX =0leading again to
    conditions () and ().
    We  insert g(z,w)[    12(1- _1-,l(z)    g (z,w)B(x) _,1-l(z)    and arrive at the two equations
    [12(1-C_1 dz _1-,l(z)+(1-)_C_1 dz(z-x) _1-,l(z)
 -e^-2    i B(x)_C_1 dz _1-,l(z)=0 and
     [12(1-C_2 dz _1-,l(z)+(1-)_C_2 dz(z-x) _1-,l(z)
 -
    B(x)_C_2 dz _1-,l(z)=0.     To solve these we need the integrals     _C_1 dz _1-,l(z)=e^i(1-        _C_2 dz _1-,l(z)=e^i(1-) B(1-,1-)(1-x)^1-    where K_1(x)F(,;1,x)    K_2(x)F(1-,1-;1;x)    F_1(x)F(,;+,x)and F_2(x)    F(1-,1-;2-One also needs the following
    identities     (1-)(1-)F(,;2,x)=(1-    K_1(x)        (1-)(1-)F(1-,1-;3-        B(1-,1-)(1-x)^1-    and K_1(x)=(1-x)^1-After some
    algebra we arrive at the desired result     2A(x)=x(1-x)_x[B(,)F_1(1-x)K_2(x)+B(1-,1-)F_2(1-x)K_1(x)].    Hence Z_qu (x)=    const. x^-(1-) (1-x)^- I(x)^-1/2 where
        I(x)(1-x)^1-    ].For completeness let us also give the result for
    , namely B(x)=12 e^-2    ilx(1-x)^(2-B(,)F_1(1-x)K_2(x)+B(1-,1-)F_2(1-x)K_1(x) (K_2(x))^2 ].
