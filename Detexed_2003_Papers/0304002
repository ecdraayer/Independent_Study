in string theory).
The N=1 supersymmetric extension of the action (1) can be interpreted as 
the Goldstone-Maxwell action associated with partial (1/2) spontaneous 
supersymmetry breaking, N=2 to N=1, whose Goldstone fermion is photino of 
a Maxwell (vector) N=1 multiplet with respect to unbroken N=1 supersymmetry
. Manifest supersymmetry does not respect the standard form (1)
 of the BI action. The complex bosonic variable, having the most natural 
supersymmetric extention, is given by 



The BI Lagrangian (1) can be rewritten in terms of  and   as




where the particular structure function  has been introduced,
  


A supersymmetrization of the bosonic BI theory (1) in the form (3) amounts to 
replacing the field strength  by the N=1 chiral spinor superfield 
strength , and  by the N=1 chiral scalar superfield 
, viz.   

 
with the same  structure function (4), so that the bosonic terms of 
eq. (5) exactly reproduce eq. (1). We use the standard notation,
 and , and 
similarly for the N=1 flat superspace covariant derivatives  and
  with  and . The gauge 
superfield strength  obeys the superfield Bianchi identities

 
In the chiral basis the gauge superfield strength reads



where  is the fermionic superpartner (photino) of the abelian BI 
vector field , and  is the real auxiliary field. In the N=1 
super-BI theory (5) setting  is consistent with its equations of motion
(this is called the 'auxiliary freedom').

The action (5) can be put into the simple 'non-linear sigma-model' form 
 

whose chiral superfield Lagrangian  is determined via the recursive 
relation


The BI action (1) is well-known to be invariant under non-trivial 
electric-magnetic duality. This means that treating  as a 
generic two-form, enforcing the Bianchi identity, , by means of a 
Lagrange multiplier (= dual vector potential) in the first-order action, and 
integrating out  in favor of the Lagrange multiplier yield the dual action 
having the same  form as eq. (1) in terms of the dual vector potential. 
The same is true in N=1 superspace for the action (5) when introducing the 
dual N=1 superfield strength as an N=1 Lagrange multiplier, and integrating
over  in the corresponding first-order action, i.e. after the N=1 
superfield Legendre transform.  

Another highly non-trivial property of eq. (5) is its invariance under the 
(non-linearly realized and spontaneously broken) second N=1 supersymmetry 
with rigid spinor parameter ,

 
The transformations (10) are consistent with the N=1 Bianchi identities (6), 
and they realize a supersymmetry algebra. The invariance of the action (5) 
under the transformations (10) follows from 
 total derivative. 

To make manifest the hidden second supersymmetry of the the N=1 BI theory, one
can reformulate it in the formalism of non-linear realizations. 
The Goldstone superfield  having the standard transformation law in the 
chiral version of the non-linearly realized N=2 supersymmetry, 
, is given by 


where the dots stand for the higher-order fermionic terms. The new
Goldstone superfield  obeys the non-linear N=1 superspace constraints 

that are also covariant under the second non-linearly realized supersymmetry. 
 The N=2 covariant derivatives in N=1 superspace

where 
, form a closed algebra. The action (5) may be 
rewritten in terms of  and the N=2 covariant derivatives (13) as 


whose N=1 chiral superfield  
, should transform as a density under the second 
supersymmetry, .

Both the electric-magnetic self-duality and the second non-linearly realized 
supersymmetry of the N=1 BI action may have been expected from its anticipated 
connection to the D3-brane action. It is just these key properties that allow 
one to identify the N=1 BI action with the low-energy effective action of the 
spacetime-filling D3-brane in the case of slowly varying fields. Any direct 
gauge-fixing of the kappa-symmetric D3-brane action would yield 
highly involved supersymmetry transformations, whose precise relation to the 
standard N=1 superspace transformations implies complicated field 
redefinitions. We didn't attempt to establish this connection explicitly.

N=1 BI action with dilaton-axion coupling 

The bosonic BI action coupled to a background dilaton  and axion  reads


The dilaton-axion background now plays the role of the effective coupling
constant, so that we chose  for simplicity. We also rescaled the BI 
action by a factor of , in order to make it invariant under the T-duality
 transformations, , where , because  multiplies 
the topological density in eq. (15).

It is not difficult to supersymmetrize eq. (15) in N=1 superspace, by using
the results of sect. 2. First, let's define a complex scalar

and assume that it belongs to an N=1 chiral superfield,

where we have introduced the physical dilatino  and the 'auxiliary' 
field . This is not quite innocent procedure in the theories with higher
derivatives, because the field  should be truly auxiliary or, at least, 
 should be a solution to the equations of motion (the auxiliary freedom).
Equation (5) implies the N=1 supersymmetric extension of eq. (15) in the form




with the same  function  defined by eq. (4) at , where we
have used the identity


The N=1 Legendre transform of the action (18) with respect to the gauge
superfield  yields the dual N=1 superspace action that has the same 
form (18) in terms of the dual N=1 superfield strength and  the dual 
coupling 

Together with imaginary shifts of  by integers the S-duality transformation
 (20) generates the full  duality, as required. In fact, the 
action (18) is invariant under the continuous  duality, as it 
belongs to the class of the  duality invariant actions 
constructed in ref. . Of course, in quantum theory only 
 survives. 

The  duality invariant dilaton and axion kinetic terms to be
added to eq. (18),

are given by the Kahler non-linear sigma-model with a Kahler potential
 
The N=1 supersymmetrization of eq. (21) in superspace is straightforward,


There is, however, a problem with another (non-linearly realized) 
supersymmetry. A variation of the leading terms in eq. (18) yields 

which is a total derivative only for a constant  dilaton-axion 
background . Yet another problem is the auxiliary freedom of .  

The way out of both problems may be the assignment of dilaton and axion to an
N=1 linear  multiplet , instead of the N=1 chiral multiplet . 
As regards the bosonic action (15), this means trading  against a gauge 
two-form , at the expense of giving up the manifest  gauge invariance,
viz. 

where the star denotes the Poincare dual,  and  
is the abelian Chern-Simons three-form. In N=1 superspace a real linear 
supefield  is defined by the constraints

It consists of a real scalar (dilaton), an antisymmetric tensor  subject
to the gauge transformation  with the one-form gauge parameter ,
a dilatino , and no  auxiliary fields. The two-form  enters
 the superfield  only via its field strength .

The leading term in eq. (18) can then be rewritten to the form


where we have introduced the Chern-Simons superfield  via the equations

By using a solution  to the Bianchi 
identities (6), in terms of the real gauge scalar superfield  subject to 
the gauge transformations , with 
, we easily 
find 

The full action given by a sum of eqs. (18) and (23) is now dependent upon the
 chiral superfields  and  only through their linear combination 
, so that it is 
possible to dualize this action in terms of the linear superfield  by 
Legendre transform. (The possibility of such transformation was 
noticed in ref. .)  We replace in eqs. (18) and (23) the combination 
 by a general real superfield , and add extra term

to the action (18). On the one hand side, varying eq. (26) with respect to  
(in fact, with respect to a potential  in the general solution 
 to the 
defining constraints (26)), we get  back. On the other hand
side, varying with respect to  in the action


we find an algebraic equation on :




Since  due to the anti-commutativity of , the
second term on the right-hand-side of recursive relation (31) can be 
considered as an 'exact' perturbation. This leads to a complete solution to 
eq. (31) in the form




where we have introduced the 'modified' N=1 linear multiplet  as
 
The appearance of the N=1 Chern-Simons superfield  is quite
natural from the point of view of string theory and D-branes, where 
Chern-Simons-type couplings (in components) are known to appear in the 
famous Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism and in the (dual) D-brane
actions. In particular, the dilaton superfield  must transform under the
 gauge transformations as  
 
in order to make  gauge-invariant. Equations (26) and (28) lead to
 the manifestly gauge-invariant constraints on ,


Such couplings were extensively studied in superspace (see e.g., 
ref.  for a recent review), while the relevant superspace geometry
appears to be closely related to a three-form N=1 multiplet introduced in
ref. . 

Substituting the solution (32) into the action (30) yields the dual action in 
the form




The existence of another non-linearly realized and spontaneously broken 
supersymmetry with the transformation law  implies 
a non-trivial transformation law of  as well, because of the
constraint (35),


The natural (minimal) manifestly N=2 covariant version of the constraints (35)
 is given by


where we have substituted the Maxwell-Goldstone N=1 superfield  by the N=1 
Goldstone superfield , and the N=1 linear (dilaton-axion) superfield 
 by its fully covariant counterpart . 
The superfield  obeys the 'canonical' constraints (6) but it has the 
complicated transformation law (10), whereas  the N=1 Goldstone superfield 
 has the 'canonical' transformation law under the second supersymmetry
but it obeys the complicated constraints (12). The same remarks also apply 
to  and , respectively. 

The defining constraints (38) on  are apparently 
consistent with the constraints (12) due to the identities 

 
that follow from the definitions (13). It may be useful to rewrite the action
 (36) into the covariant form

with respect to the hidden (extra) supersymmetry, where we have introduced a
 density  in the full N=1 superspace.
