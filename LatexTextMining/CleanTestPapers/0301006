 supersymmetric  gauge theory with adjoint matter
 and a polynomial superpotential  has been much
studied recently. The classical theory has several vacua labeled
by integers , with the classical unbroken gauge
group . Quantum mechanically, each classical
vacuum leads to  different vacua.  As the parameters
of  are varied, these vacua change in a continuous (and
holomorphic) fashion. We find that vacua associated with
 can be continuously transformed to vacua with
, thus leading to a new kind of duality.
Traditional order parameters, like the Wilson loop and 't Hooft
loop, sometimes distinguish different phases.  We also find phases
that are not distinguished by conventional order parameters. The
whole picture of the phase diagram is reminiscent of the phase
diagram of -theory.

Introduction 

Dynamics of four-dimensional  supersymmetric gauge theories has
proved to be a remarkably rich subject -  one that hopefully will
ultimately be important for the understanding of nature! Among
other attractions of these theories, models with 
supersymmetry exhibit many subtle properties, such as dynamical
generation of mass, confinement of charge, and dynamical symmetry
breaking, that are seen in the world of strong interactions and
are still not fully understood (for a review, see e.g.
).  One example that has been much-studied in
recent years is a  gauge theory with a chiral superfield
 in the adjoint representation and a general single-trace
superpotential , for some polynomial function 
that we will take to be of degree  and suitably generic. This
model has been studied by its relation to geometric transitions
and mirror symmetry in string theory
and more recently by its
surprising relation  to a bosonic matrix model - a zero-dimensional model with an
 matrix  and potential , where
.  In this paper, we will investigate some
additional fascinating properties of this example.

Let us first explain the original question that motivated our
investigation. In this model, if the function  has critical
points , , then a classical vacuum is chosen by
taking  to be a diagonal matrix whose eigenvalues are the
, taken with multiplicity ; the  are any
non-negative integers such that . We let  be the
number of choices of  with . Clearly, . At the
classical level, the choice of  spontaneously breaks the
gauge group from  to  (where we include in
the product only the positive ).  Locally, this group is
isomorphic to .  At low energies, the
 gauge theories become confining and massive, so quantum
mechanically, the gauge group that is actually observed at low
energies is .

Since this is independent of , the question now arises of
whether it is possible quantum mechanically to distinguish in a
precise way between vacua that have the same value of  but
different .  To make this question clear, start with a choice
of  such that the  are far apart and the classical
description of the  field is a good approximation, and put
the theory in a vacuum characterized by a given choice of
integers . Now vary the parameters in , possibly
passing through a region in which  are not far apart, but
then return to a semiclassical region in which the  are
widely separated.  In such a process, can one interpolate from a
vacuum with one set of integers  to a vacuum with another set
of integers ?

Let us provide a more systematic framework for this question. For
each choice of , the theory under investigation has only
a finite set of vacua.  We will allow the parameters in  to
vary, keeping only the leading coefficient (and the microscopic
gauge coupling parameter of the underlying  theory) fixed.
The varying parameters describe a complex manifold 
.In this counting, we discard an irrelevant
additive constant in  and set the highest power in 
to .  As we vary
the parameters in , the vacua fit into a moduli space
 which because of supersymmetry is a complex manifold.
 is a union of components (irreducible complex
submanifolds)  which may possibly intersect at
singularities. Each component  is a finite cover
of , and hence by going to infinity in , we
reach in each  at least one semiclassical "end"
with a definite set of .  Our question is now whether the
same  can have different ends with different sets
of .

To avoid undue suspense, let us assert that the answer to this
question has turned out to be "yes."  In considering the
question, however, it soon becomes clear that  one really should
ask all the questions that are usually asked in string theory and
-theory. What are the components of  and what
distinguishes them? What semi-classical ends do they have and to
what extent do they intersect at singularities? What is the
physics at these singularities?  (Some examples of singularities
have been studied in .)  When  does have
distinct components , what kind of natural
"off-shell" interpolations can one make between them? Without
going back to the underlying  gauge theory (which really
gives the most incisive definition of the whole problem), what
kind of a low energy phenomenological Lagrangian or a "string
field theory" can one find that describes all of the 
 at once?

Smooth interpolations between classical limits with different
gauge groups have been found in some other four-dimensional
models.  For example, in , in the context of -theory
compactification on a  manifold, an interpolation from
 to  was argued, along with several other
examples. This was generalized by Freedman , who
considered some additional examples, including models with 
gauge symmetry broken by Wilson lines to , and proposed interpolation between different
sets of  in that case. Because the symmetry breaking pattern is the
same, one may wonder if the model is actually equivalent by some
string duality to the one considered in the present paper. One obstacle
to finding such a duality is that it is not
clear what the superpotential  would correspond to in the
model considered in . At any rate, the present paper
is devoted to studying a field theory problem by field theory
methods; our interpolations and dualities are purely field
theoretic and do not depend on stringy phenomena.

It will become clear that the subject we are exploring is very
rich, and in the
present paper we will really only describe some general properties
and explore some examples.  Most likely, many interesting
phenomena remain to be uncovered.

Since it turns out that  does have many components, one
basic question is how to distinguish them. One fundamental
invariant that we have already identified is the rank  of the
true low energy gauge group. In many physical theories, another
important invariant comes from the realization of symmetries:
which subgroup of the global symmetry group is unbroken in a given
component of the moduli space of vacua?  In the present paper,
this criterion will be somewhat less useful, because for generic
 there generally are no global symmetries; still, the
realization of global symmetries, and more generally,
transformations of  that must also be taken to act on the
parameters in , will give some important information.
Additional important information will come from a more subtle but
still standard type of order parameter that is provided by
confinement: for an external Wilson loop in a given representation
of , does one observe a Coulomb law or an area law?

All these standard order parameters will play a major role in the
present paper, but we will see that they do not suffice.  We also
will encounter a more subtle sort of order parameter that only can
be defined using supersymmetry.  It may be characterized as
follows.  Suppose that a theory with  supersymmetry
has  independent chiral superfields ,
.When we say that they are independent, we mean
that they obey no relations in the chiral ring of the theory that are
independent of the parameters  in the superpotential.  Since we
are working over the parameter space , we are treating the
 as variables rather than as fixed complex numbers.   By
supersymmetry, the  (or more precisely their
expectation values)  are holomorphic functions on .  Now
suppose that  exceeds the complex dimension of the moduli space
.  Then as functions on any given component 
, the  inevitably obey some algebraic
equations; if these equations are different for different 
, this gives an order parameter of sorts by which the
 can be distinguished.  We will find many
examples of this situation, where the  cannot be
distinguished by any conventional order parameter that we can see
but can be distinguished by the chiral equations that are obeyed
on them. When this occurs, we do not know if the
-dependence of these chiral  equations should be regarded
as an explanation for the existence of different branches, or
merely as a description of the phenomenon.

Organization Of The Paper 

This paper is organized as follows.   Section 2 is devoted to
general considerations. In section 2.1, we describe what can be
predicted about the moduli space of vacua from a "weak coupling"
(actually weak gauge coupling) point of view in which the effects
of the superpotential  are assumed to set in at much
higher energies than the effects of the gauge coupling.  We focus
on understanding what can be said about the moduli space of vacua
using the expected confinement of the low energy gauge theory.

In section 2.2, following previous literature
, , we consider a strong (gauge) coupling
point of view, in which the superpotential is considered as a
small perturbation of a strongly coupled gauge theory with ;
this theory has  supersymmetry and a vacuum structure
determined in In previous
work, the strong coupling point of view was used to analyze the
vacua with a given rank  of the unbroken symmetry group. That
analysis assumed that the  defined above are all nonzero and
that the degree of  is not too large.  We generalize the
analysis to remove these restrictions.  (This analysis is
completed in Appendix A.)


In section 2.3, we review a construction originally described in
 whereby, given vacua for the  gauge theory with any
given set of , and any integer , one can construct vacua
for the  gauge theory with .  Comparing to our
analysis of confinement in section 2.1, we will see that the vacua
arising this way are precisely the confining vacua in which the
confinement index (defined in section 2.1) is .  Conversely,
all vacua with confinement index  arise by this construction.
Since the theory with  also has vacua without
confinement or with lower confinement index (as will be clear in
section 2.1), there must be additional vacua with ;
they will be studied (in examples) in section 3.

In section 2.4, we present some ways in which different branches
 can arise and some constraints on the possible
classical limits of a given branch.   We also describe the
simplest mechanism by which different branches may intersect.

In section 3, we will explore the question of interpolating from
one set of  to another.  For this, we want to consider the
simplest case in which   is as small as possible. For ,
the gauge group is completely unbroken at the classical level, so
the question of interpolating between classical limits with
different unbroken gauge groups does not arise.  So the first case
is really that the rank of the low energy gauge group is 
which (in the minimal case with all  non-vanishing) arises
for a cubic superpotential, . Since we do not know how to
make the analysis for general , we will explore in detail the
cases of , and 6. For these values of  and ,
we determine in detail all branches of the moduli space of vacua,
recovering the confining vacua that were found in section 2.3 and
describing the vacua without confinement.  For the vacua without
confinement, we do get the promised smooth continuations between
different values of , including interpolation from
 to  for ,  from  to 
for , and from  to  to  for . We
conjecture that for any , smooth interpolations are possible on
the Coulomb branch from any  to any other
.


In this detailed description for , we also see how
branches with  meet branches with  at singularities. In
addition to these intersections at finite points on the moduli
space, we find for  that all branches meet the
Coulomb branch at infinity, where the semiclassical description is
valid.

In section 4, we consider the opposite limit of large .  For
, that is all , there is a unique vacuum for each
function  and so our question about the different
branches does not arise.  So we consider the case that  is
small but positive.  Here, the simple strong coupling analysis of
section 2.2 predicts that there must be at least  branches
of vacua.  As far as we know, they are not distinguished by
conventional order parameters.  We show, as suggested above, that
they can be distinguished by determining which holomorphic
functions of the chiral superfields vanish on each branch.  We do
not know how best to interpret this result.

In two appendices, we give more details of the strong gauge
coupling analysis.  In appendix A, we extend the proof that
relates the matrix model curve to the  curve to  of
high degree. In appendix B, we show how the generalized Konishi
anomaly ,  which was derived and used
in  arises in the strong gauge coupling regime where the
elementary gauge fields are not visible.  In appendix C we list
some useful properties of Chebyshev polynomials.  Appendix D
defines a magnetic index  which characterizes the confinement
in a theory with massless photons.  It is related to the
confinement index  of section 2.3 through .

General Considerations 

Confinement 


Here, we will see what we can say about the  gauge theory
with adjoint superfield  by using confinement as an order
parameter.  First we consider the matter directly in field
theory, and then we re-examine the issues using the matrix model.


We consider a classical vacuum in which  eigenvalues of
 are placed at the  critical point of the
superpotential .  To keep the exposition simple, we will
assume that the  are all positive. We also assume that the
critical points of  are distinct, so that all components of
 are massive classically.
 Supposing that the underlying  gauge theory is weakly
coupled at the scale set by those masses, the low energy physics
is simply that of the pure supersymmetric gauge theory with
classical gauge group 
.

If , each of the  theories becomes confining at
exponentially smaller energies. For any , the 
theory has  vacua, each with a mass gap. The total number of
vacua for fixed  and fixed  is hence .
If only  and  are specified, and not the
individual number  of eigenvalues at the  critical
point, then the total number of vacua is larger, as one must allow
for permutations of eigenvalues among the critical points.

In the limit of small gauge coupling, the different 
factors decouple and each of them confines.  This confinement can
be diagnosed by the possible area law of the Wilson loops  of
the various .
 In the full theory, these  are not well-defined.
Correspondingly, the full  theory is not necessarily
confining even if the sub-theories are.
 (In this discussion, the
 factor in the underlying gauge group 
 is unimportant, as it decouples and does not contribute to
the dynamics.)  For a precise criterion for confinement, we have
to use Wilson lines of the full  theory.


To probe confinement, we consider a large Wilson loop in some
representation  of , and ask if it exhibits an
area law or a Coulomb law. All that matters about  is
how it transforms under the center of , which is ,
generated by 
.  The reason that only the center matters is
that if  and  are two irreducible
representations that transform in the same way under the center,
then an external charge in the representation  can
combine with gluons to make an external charge in the
representation , so one of these external charges is confined
(has infinite energy) if and only if the other is. Turning one
representation into another by combining with gluons is a process
that we may call electric screening.

To give an example with any desired action of the center, we can
simply take  to be the tensor product of  copies of
the fundamental representation, for some . If  is a
Wilson loop in the fundamental representation, the Wilson loop
for the representation  is just .  Only the value of 
modulo  matters.

If two representations  and  are unconfined,
then so is the tensor product .  So the set of
values of  for which there is no confinement is closed under
addition. There is no area law for  (since  is
equivalent to ), so the smallest positive value of  for
which there is no area law is always a divisor of .  We denote
this number as  and call it the confinement index. If the
theory is completely confining (all Wilson loops with non-trivial
action of the center have an area law), then , and if the
theory is completely unconfining (no Wilson loop shows an area
law), then .

Let us now give a few examples of the behavior of the 
theory.  Suppose that  is broken classically to
.  All vacua will be unconfining simply
because there is no confinement in .  The fundamental
representation of  has a component which is an 
singlet, and this component feels no confining gauge forces.  When
we evaluate the expectation value of a Wilson line in the
fundamental representation ,
  _R P_CA, 
the gauge field is effectively an  matrix and a
commuting  component associated with the  factor
(plus massive fields that will not influence the question of
confinement). In computing the expectation value in ,
assuming that  is very large compared to the scale at which
 becomes strongly coupled, the dominant contribution will
come from the "bottom" component of . This component does
not interact with the  gauge fields, so there is no area
law.  Since this component interacts with the massless 
gauge field, the Wilson loop  exhibits the behavior of a
Coulomb phase rather than a Higgs phase.

Computation Of Confinement Index In An
Example 

For a simple example with a non-trivial confinement index, we will
explore the case
 that  is broken to 
. The fundamental representation of 
decomposes as 
under .  (We ignore the  charges,
which will not affect confinement.)  The tensor product of 
copies of  contains a singlet. So, as in the
above example, the Wilson line  will show no area law.
Likewise,  will show no area law.

Let  be the greatest common divisor of  and .
Absence of confinement for  and for  implies that
there is no confinement for  for any positive
integers .  We can pick  and  so that
 is congruent mod  to . So the confinement
index  can be no bigger than , and if electric screening,
which we have considered so far, were the only mechanism, it would
equal  precisely.

However, there is another mechanism, magnetic screening. Let us
first recall 't Hooft's description of confined phases of 
gauge theory.   One introduces an 't Hooft loop, which we will
call ;  is constructed using a twist by an element of the
center of .  The general loop order parameter is ,
where  both take values from  to  (alternatively,
their values only matter modulo ). Massive phases are described
by saying for which values of  there is no area law; one says
that charges with this value of  and  are "condensed." (In
some situations, for example a confining theory obtained by a
small perturbation of an  theory, one can make the
intuition behind this language precise .)  In
particular, there are  possible confining phases; in the
 such phase,  has no area law, or equivalently a
charge with quantum numbers  is "condensed."

 super Yang-Mills theory with gauge group  has
 confining vacua, with each type appearing precisely once. In
fact, an adiabatic increase of the theta angle by  has the
effect of increasing  by 1.

So when we break the underlying  theory to 
, we get a low energy theory that indeed has
 vacua, but they are not equivalent.  They can be
distinguished by the type of confinement.  For each pair 
(with ), there is one vacuum in which
 and  are unconfined. (Here we write
 and  for Wilson lines in the fundamental
representations of  and , respectively, and
similarly  and  are the 't Hooft loops of the two
factors of the low energy gauge group.  As we remarked above,
this makes sense only near the weak gauge coupling limit.)

This theory also has 't Hooft-Polyakov magnetic monopoles.  If
, , we take the basic  monopole whose
magnetic field at infinity is (in a unitary gauge) a multiple of
(1 & 0 0 & -1  ).  For any
 , and , we just embed the  monopole in
 in such a way that it does not fit entirely in either
 or  - we take the "1" in the upper left to
act in  and the "" in the lower right to act in
.  (We could also embed the monopole entirely in
 or entirely in , but this would give nothing
interesting for our present purposes.)

Now suppose we probe the  vacuum of the full 
theory with  the external Wilson loop . Although
 is not necessarily a multiple of , we claim that
this Wilson loop will not show an area law. The external 
charge  can, after symmetry breaking to 
, be divided between the two factors in various ways, and
confinement will be avoided if there is any way to divide the
charge to make the energy finite.  We simply put  units of
charge in  and  units in . (The charges
are only well-defined modulo  and .)  So in other words,
 can behave in the low energy theory as 
. But the external Wilson line  can
be screened by the spontaneous nucleation from the vacuum of the
magnetic monopole described in the last paragraph. Since the
monopole has magnetic charge  in  and  in
, it can be represented as .  So in
conjunction with a monopole,  can be represented in the
low energy theory as , and has no
area law since (by the definition of  and ),
 has no area law in , and
 (which is obtained from  by
reversing the orientation of the loop) has no area law in
.

The net effect is that there is no area law for , for
, or for .  Hence the confinement index 
is at most the greatest common divisor of , , and 
.  We claim that this is the correct value, since by now
we have considered screening by all of the electric and magnetic
objects that exist in the theory.

It is easy to see why the confinement index depends not on 
and  separately but only on their difference .  In fact,
under , one has , for ,
while external Wilson loops are unaffected.  The confinement index
must be invariant under this operation, so can only depend on the
difference of the .

General Case 

We can easily extend this analysis to the general case that 
is broken down to .  Electric screening
ensures that there is no area law for , . In
addition, we must consider magnetic screening. The low energy
theory  has  vacua, which are characterized by
giving integers ,  (with )
such that in the low energy  theory,  has
no area law. A magnetic monopole can be shared between 
and  in such a way that it has charges
.One can more generally share a monopole
between  and  for any , but this monopole
leads to nothing new because its charges are a linear combination
of the charges of monopoles considered in the text.  It follows,
just as in the case with  that was considered above, that the
external Wilson line  has no area law. (To make
the argument, we simply place  units of charge in 
and  units in  and then screen this
configuration using the monopole.)

So if we let , the confinement index  is now
the greatest common divisor of the  and the .

There are  different types of branch with confinement index
. For a branch of the  type, the operators that do not
have an area law are  and .

Interpretation In The Matrix Model 

The matrix model is described  by a complex curve :
 y_m^2= W'(x)^2+f_n-1 (x), 
where  depends on the gauge coupling and the . We assume
for simplicity that ; i.e. no  vanishes.  is a
double cover of the -plane. With  being of degree , the
right hand side of  has  zeroes; the projection of
 to the complex -plane is branched at these 
points.

figure1.eps  
Figure 1 :
Branch cuts, depicted by zigzags connecting the , and
 cycles  surrounding the cuts, are depicted here
for .  
The situation can be described particularly simply for weak
coupling, where  is small. The polynomial  has  roots
, and for small , the polynomial  has, for each
, a pair of roots  that are near .When
the parameters are such that the roots  are real, we ask
that .   More generally, the symbols  are just
labels.  We connect the  with branch cuts, as in figure
1, so that  is a single-valued function away from these cuts.

In , the operator-valued differential
T(x)=dxx-   was introduced.  It was shown
that over a cycle  surrounding the  cut (also shown
in figure 1), the period of  was
 N_i=_A_i  T. 
(To keep the formulas simple, in this paper we define the contour
integral  to include a factor of .) In the
present paper, we want to go away from the weak coupling limit, so
we cannot assume that the  zeroes of  are neatly
paired up.  Likewise, we will not have a distinguished set of
 cycles.  So in developing the theory, we will have to
include, along with the , the other compact cycles with which
the  will mix. There are  of these, sketched in figure
2.  The new cycles, which we call , roughly connect 
to , for .  We define
 c_i=_C_i T. 
One might guess that since the  are integers, and will mix
with the  under strong coupling monodromies, the  are
also integers.  We will prove this at the end of this section,
using results from .  It turns out that the periods of 
 are the integers  only on shell; i.e. only after all
the equations of motion have been solved. Off shell, before
solving the equations of motion of , the periods around the
 cycles  are given by the integers  but the periods
around the  cycles are not constrained. A more detailed
discussion of this point will appear below and in a separate
publication.

depicted by a dashed line is on the second sheet below the cut.
  
Now let us recall the matrix model construction of the gauge
theory  effective superpotential. Here one uses another
differential, which in the matrix model is
 R(x)=g_mN dxx-M  
where  is the finite 't Hooft coupling of the matrix model.

                    S_i .  
Here  are the noncompact cycles sketched in figure 3.  The
 and  are a canonical basis of the homology of the
compact surface made by adding points at infinity to ;
their intersection pairings are ,
.  The  are related to the compact
cycles  introduced in the last paragraph by
 C_i=B_i+1 -B_i . 
Furthermore, 
is the gluino bilinear of   (a more rigorous definition of
 is given in ), and  is called the
"prepotential."

figure3.eps  
Figure 3 :
Non-compact cycles  for . The bullets represent the two
punctures of the Riemann surface (that is, the two points lying
above ). The  cycle  passes through the  cut
and connects the two
punctures, which are on different sheets.  
To obtain the matrix model expression for the superpotential, one
starts
 with the fact that the model is dual to string theory on
a certain non-compact Calabi-Yau threefold .
On the threefold, the superpotential is
, where   is the   covariantly constant
 holomorphic
three-form of ,
and the flux  has integral periods on compact cycles.
By integrating out the extra dimensions, one reduces
this expression to an integral over a Riemann surface (subsequently
understood as the
matrix model curve).  In this reduction,  descends to a differential
form  whose periods on compact cycles are integers, and
 descends to the differential .  The superpotential becomes

, like , is real;
we have denoted it  because  is a differential of
type , so only the  part of  actually
contributes to the integral. 
Evaluating this in the usual way in terms of contour integrals
over one-cycles  and  (and remembering our factor of  in the
definition of a contour integral), we get the  usual matrix model formula
for the effective superpotential for the :
 W_eff (S_i)=2i _i(_A_i T_0
 _B_i  R- _B_i T_0_A_i R) 
We will modify previous treatments only in not assuming that
 is independent of .

According to the familiar analyses  of the superpotential,
.  In addition, we set 
. Let us compare these to the periods of  as given in
equations  and . Since  and  have the
same periods on the -cycles, and the -cycles will mix with
the -cycles under strong coupling monodromies, it is natural to
conjecture that also their periods on the -cycles are equal,
. As will be explained in detail in a separate
publication, this holds on-shell, that is after imposing the
equations of motion of the . (Off-shell, the  periods of
 depend on the , while  has integral periods
even before imposing the  equations of motion.)


The integrals of  over the noncompact cycles  must
then be as follows.   for some
complex number , and more generally
 _B_i T_0 = -_0 -b_i, 
with
 b_i=-_j=1 ^i-1 c_j. 
So we get for the effective superpotential
 W_eff (S_i)=_i=1 ^n N_i S_i  +2i _0 _i=1 ^n S_i +2i
 _i=2 ^nb_iS_i.  The derivation of   does not require
 the knowledge that  on shell.

The only addition that we are making to previous studies of this
problem is to include the last term, proportional to the .
Let us explain what this term does.  The Veneziano-Yankielowicz
superpotential for  supersymmetric gluodynamics is
 W(S)=S[(^3M /S^M) +M]. 
The logarithm is only defined modulo , so  is not
defined on the -plane but on an infinite cover thereof where
for the time being we allow all possible branches of the
logarithm. On this infinite cover, the number of critical points
of  is ; the equation for a critical point is indeed
 (^3M /S^M)=0, 
and this equation implies that , an equation
that has the familiar  roots. (Moreover, after picking  so
, we must, to obey , pick the correct
branch of the logarithm, so each solution of 
leads to only one vacuum.) Now consider, instead of , the
superpotential
 W(S)=M[ S(^3/S)+S]. 
Again, this superpotential is defined on an infinite cover of the
 plane, but now on this infinite cover, the equation for a
critical point is , which implies 
. There is only one root, namely .

What has happened?  Mathematically, there are really  different
ways to define an infinite cover of the -plane on which the
Veneziano-Yankielowicz superpotential  is defined. The
reason is that when the argument of  shifts by ,
 shifts by .  We do not need to
allow all branches of the logarithm to get a space on which  is
defined; it suffices to consider  of all of the branches.  We
could pick an arbitrary integer  and say that when
 is positive, we want  to
have an imaginary part congruent to  .
So the Veneziano-Yankielowicz superpotential can be defined on
each of  different spaces , , each
of which is an infinite cover of the -plane.  Chiral symmetry
permutes these, so physically we should include all of them, which
is equivalent to including all branches of


The superpotential  is equivalent to  defined
only on .  It therefore only describes one of the
vacua.  To describe the others, in this language, we should
explicitly include additional branches on which the
superpotential is
 W_b=M[ S(^3/S)+S]
 +2i b S. 
The physical meaning of  is very simple.  A superpotential
term which is an imaginary multiple of  is just a shift in the
theta angle.  So including  just shifts the theta angle by
, which will rotate confinement (condensation of an 't
Hooft loop) to oblique confinement (condensation of a mixture of
't Hooft and Wilson loops). Thus, for given , the vacuum that
is realized has condensation of  a -dependent combination of
't Hooft and Wilson loops .

Since in this paper we will be interested in studying  gauge
theories rather than , we would like to extend  to
this case.  As in , we define 
.  Here  is the trace over the 
fields and it is taken to be an independent chiral superfield in
the effective theory.   is the field strength superfield
of the .  A fact which was useful in  is
the decoupling of this .  This decoupling is implemented by
considering the "superfield" 
, where  is an auxiliary
anticommuting Lorentz spinor.  The first term in  is then
written as 

, which is independent of
. (In fact, any expression of the form 
 is independent of .)   The  term in
 can also be written equally well in terms of  in (in
) or  (in ), since  is an integer and
abelian gauge theory is invariant under a  shift in the
theta angle.

Now let us go back to the matrix model superpotential ,
replacing  in the above discussion with any of the .  For
small , 
.  So our effective superpotential
for small  is (we drop the terms which involve two
derivatives of the prepotential )
 W_eff (S_i)=_i ( 2i _0S_i + N_iS_i
 [ (_i^3/ S_i) +1] + 2ib_iS_i)
 + (S_i S_j). 
The first term is the bare coupling.  The second term includes the
one loop renormalization of the coupling constant and the strong
 IR dynamics.  The last term  represents
the perturbative contribution of the high energy theory.  Our new
term  arises also from the strong IR dynamics of
.  It should be independent of the photon of 
 and therefore the constants  are quantized.

 From  it is clear that the integers  represent
relative shifts by  of the theta angles of the various
. More explicitly, relative to the theta angle in
, the theta angle in  is greater by .
So if  has condensation of ,The value of
 depends on the bare coupling  and on how  is
defined.  then  has condensation  of , where
. (Our definitions are such that .)

Thus, the  that we have defined in  are the same as
the ones we introduced in our general discussion of confinement.
So the confinement index  is the greatest common divisor of
the  and the , or equivalently, the greatest common
divisor of the  and .  Since  and  are a
complete set of periods of  (integrated over  compact cycles),
we can describe this by saying that the confinement index is the
greatest integer  such that all compact periods of   are
integral.  This gives, in the context of the matrix model, a
manifestly "modular invariant" definition of the confinement
index.

In section 2.3, we will (following ) describe an operation
that multiplies  by an arbitrary positive integer , also
multiplying the individual  by  and multiplying  by
. This operation only generates confining vacua.  In fact, it
multiplies the confinement index by .  We will see that all
confining vacua arise by applying this operation, starting with a
non-confining vacuum with a smaller value of .  So for any
given , the "new" vacua that cannot be predicted based on
what happened for smaller  are the "Coulomb" vacua, the ones
without confinement.  For every , and every set of ,
there are Coulomb vacua - for example, those vacua in which any
of the  is 1.

Finally, we explain how to deduce from the results of  that
the   are integers.  Instead of studying the present problem
using the matrix model curve, we can use the  curve
 y^2=P_N(x)^2-4^2N . 
(According to , these curves are closely related, with
; we will not need here
to explicitly use this relation.) In appendix A of , it was
argued that .  This can alternatively be written
 T=1P_N+y d(P_N+y)=d(P_N+y). 
Like any logarithmic derivative,  has integer periods (recall
that we include a factor of  in the definition of
). In other words,  over a compact cycle is the
change in  around that cycle, and
this is an integer.

Considerations based on strong gauge coupling 

The opposite of the weak gauge coupling approach of section 2.1
is a strong gauge coupling approach in which the superpotential
is regarded as a small perturbation of the  gauge
dynamics that one would have if . This approach was
developed in  by using methods of .  Here we will
review this analysis and extend it to allow some of the  to
vanish and to allow superpotentials of any degree.

We write the superpotential as

W = _r=0 ^k g_rr+1   ^r+1   . 

In our present discussion, the superpotential is considered a
small perturbation of an   theory. We interpret 
as an effective superpotential on the  Coulomb moduli space
by replacing   by its vev 
, regarded as a function on the  moduli space.  In
order to look for vacua in which the low energy gauge group is
, we must extremize the superpotential  constrained
to submanifolds of the Coulomb branch where  monopoles of
the  theory are massless (physically, the constraint
is imposed because the massless monopoles get masses and vevs
when  is turned on).  The perturbation by  lifts all  vacua
of the  Coulomb moduli space, except for a finite number
which survive.

It is convenient to introduce, for each  vacuum, a
classical  matrix  such that 
 for .   Moreover,
we set   for all positive
integers . For , the  are independent and
are the usual order parameters of the  theory.  For ,
both  and  can be
expressed in terms of the  of , but for 
, as shown in Appendix A of , they are unequal.

 The classical
vacua of this theory are obtained by setting all eigenvalues of
 and  equal to
 roots of .  In the present section,
we will  take the degree of the superpotential to be ,
so that the  that appear in the superpotential are
independent and .  In
Appendix A, we generalize to arbitrary .

At a generic point on the Coulomb branch of the 
theory, the low energy gauge group is .   We want to
study vacua in which the perturbation by  leaves only 
gauge group  at low energies, with . This occurs if the
remaining degrees of freedom become massive when 
because of the condensation of  mutually local magnetic
monopoles. This can happen only at points where (at ) the
monopoles are massless. Monopole condensation for   can
be seen by including the  monopole hypermultiplets in the
superpotential,

 W_eff  = _l=1 ^N-n  M_l(u_k) q_l q_l +
_r=0 ^k g_r u_r+1 .  

Here ,  are the monopole fields and 
is the mass of  monopole as a function of the .  In a
supersymmetric vacuum,  the variation of  with respect to
 and  is zero. However, for suitable , the
variation with respect to the 's does not allow 
 to be zero. Therefore the mass of the monopoles has to
vanish, i.e.  for 
.

The masses  are known to be equal to periods of a certain
meromorphic one-form over some cycles of the  hyperelliptic
curve,

 y^2 = P_N^2(x) - 4^2N   

where  is a polynomial of degree
.

In , it was shown that it is more convenient to use the fact
that at points with  mutually local massless monopoles, the
 curve degenerates as follows:

  y^2 = P_N^2(x) - 4^2N  = F_2n (x)
H_N-n ^2(x).  

This factorization is satisfied on an -dimensional subspace of
the Coulomb branch on which the superpotential should be
extremized to find the points that preserve 
supersymmetry.

The condition  can easily be incorporated by means of
Lagrange multipliers . Using such a superpotential, it was
shown in  that on shell and when the degree  of  is
equal to , the highest  coefficients of  are
given  in terms of  as follows,

F_2n (x) =1g^2_n  W'(x)^2 + O (x^n-1 ). 

Assuming that  is given and the problem is to determine the
 vacuum or equivalently ,  is used as
follows.  determines  in terms of  unknown
coefficients. These are then determined, together with the
desired , by asking for existence of a polynomial 
such that , as in .  It
is also often convenient to study the inverse problem: starting
with an  vacuum with  massless monopoles - in
other words, a  that enables the factorization in  for
suitable  and  - one asks what superpotential
 would lead to this vacuum.  For , this problem has a
unique solution (modulo an irrelevant additive constant) since if
 is known,  determines .

The main result of this subsection is to give the generalization
of  to , or in other words to the case in which some
of the  are zero. We  repeat the proof of  given in
, using a slightly different way to introduce the
constraints. In Appendix A, we make a
further generalization to arbitrary , dropping the restriction
.

Let us add to the superpotential constraints imposing the
factorization . It is useful to write 
; i.e.  are the locations of the
double roots of . Then we take

  
 W_eff  =&  _r=0 ^k g_r u_r+1  +
 _i=1 ^N-n  ( L_i P_N(x)
 -2_i ^N x-p_i  dx
 + B_iP_N(x)-2_i ^N 
 (x-p_i)^2 dx )=&
 _r=0 ^k g_r u_r+1  +
 _i=1 ^N-n  ( L_i(P_N(x)x-p_i 
 dx -2_i ^N )
 + B_iP_N(x)(x-p_i)^2 dx )   

Here  is a function of .  and  are Lagrange
multipliers imposing the constraints,  and
the contour of integration is a large curve around  that
encloses all 's. We also have included a factor of 
 in the definition of the symbol  in order to avoid
cluttering of equations.

The variation with respect to  leads to
  0=P_N(x) (x-p_i)^2  dx= P'_N(p_i) =
 P_N(p_i)1p_i-_cl  
  
(The last step in  follows from the fact that
, where
 are the eigenvalues of .  Since
 (given  and the fact that
), we learn that
 1p_i-_cl   =0 
We can use either  or  to solve for  in terms of
the , but let us not do it now.  Equation  or 
will be used in Appendix B.

Minimization of 
leads to . However, we will not
attempt to carry this out. Instead, we will try to get information
about  at the minimum by continuing to study the field
equations.

Let us consider variations of  with respect to ,

 P_N(x) ( _i=1 ^N-n 
L_i(x-p_i)^2  +2 B_i(x-p_i)^3 ) dx=2 B_i
  P_N(x) (x-p_i)^3  dx =0 

where we used .  Assuming that  does not have any
triple or higher roots,  implies that .

Let us now consider variations with respect to .  We use
 P_N(x) = ( (x-_cl  ) )
 = x^N (-_r=0 ^u_r x^r ) . 
Since  is a polynomial in ,  can be used to
express  with  in terms of  with  by
imposing the vanishing of negative powers of . (See Appendix
A.) We can also write  as
 P_N(x) = [ x^N
 (-_r=0 ^u_r x^r )]_+ 
only in terms of the independent , those with 
.The symbol  denotes the polynomial part of a
Laurent series .  The derivative of  with respect to
 is
 P_N(x) u_r  = -
 [ P_N(x) x^r  ]_+ 

We are now ready to differentiate  with respect to :
  g_r-1  = [ P_N(x) x^r  ]_+
 _i=1 ^N-n  L_ix-p_i  dx = P_N(x) x^r 
 _i=1 ^N-n  L_ix-p_i  dx 

It is convenient to multiply  with  and to sum
over  ( is inside the contour of integration)
  W'(z) =  P_N(x) x-z 
 _i=1 ^N-n  L_ix-p_i  dx. 
We define the polynomial  in  terms of
 _i=1 ^N-n  L_ix-p_i  = Q(x)  H_N-n (x) . 

and write  as

  W'(z) =  Q(x)H_N-n (x)  P_N(x) x-z  dx. 

Since  is a polynomial of degree , the polynomial
 is of degree , and we will denote it as 
(its definition  determined it as a polynomial of degree 
).

Finally, notice from  that,



So we can freely replace  by 
 in  to get,


 W'(z) =  Q_k-n (x) F_2n (x)  x-z
 dx . 

We can easily recognize  if it is written

 W'(z) =  y_m(x) x-z  dx 

with

  y_m^2(x) = F_2n (x) Q^2_k-n (x).  

 is the  matrix model curve (for a case in which only 
of a possible  cuts have "opened up"), and  is the
corresponding "equation of motion" for the matrix model
eigenvalues.

 From  we conclude that  has to be generalized to

 F_2n (x) Q^2_k-n (x) = W'_k(x)^2 + O (x^k-1 ).
 

In the case when , we recover  with .
 can be used just like  to determine the 
vacuum if  is given.  With  known,  determines
, assuming its leading coefficient is normalized to 1, in
terms of  parameters, which are then determined, along with
 and , by requiring the factorization .  For
the inverse problem, things are a little different.  If we start
with an  vacuum, so that , , and
 are known, and we want to constrain , then 
actually leaves  free parameters in the determination of .
In the classical limit, the meaning of this is that if all
eigenvalues of  are placed at  zeroes of , then the
expectation values  are entirely
independent of the other  zeroes.


In appendix A, we prove that the generalization of  for
arbitrarily large  is

 F_2n (x)Q _k-n ^2(x) = W'_k(x)^2 + O (x^k-1 )   

where



and  is a polynomial of degree  whose
coefficients are new Lagrange multipliers.

Note that  and  have the same structure. Moreover,
they provide enough equations, as in the case of , to
determine the vacuum if  is given, or to determine  modulo
a physically sensible redundancy in the case of the inverse
problem.


It is interesting to note that this result is consistent with the
fact that the matrix model does not have information about the
rank of the field theory gauge group . It only knows about
the number of  cuts, i.e. the number of non-zero .

See Appendix A for the generalization to superpotentials of
arbitrary degree.

The Multiplication Map And The Confinement Index  

In , a construction was described that, for any positive
integer , maps vacua of the  theory with a given
superpotential  to vacua of the  theory with the same
superpotential.
 This operation maps classical limits with unbroken
 to classical limits with unbroken
 and so in particular leaves fixed the rank
 of the low energy gauge group. We now review this construction
and show that it multiplies the confinement index by  and that
all vacua of  with confinement index  arise from the
Coulomb vacua of  under this multiplication map. This
implies in particular that, for any , the only "new" vacua,
which cannot be deduced from a  vacuum (for some )  via
the multiplication map, are the Coulomb vacua.

A key role is played in the analysis by the polynomials
 that describe those  vacua of the 
theory that have the maximum number of massless monopoles, namely
. These are the vacua that survive when the 
theory is perturbed by a quadratic superpotential
; this perturbation removes  from the
low energy theory, whereupon the  gauge theory becomes
massive at low energies, with  vacua.  From the 
point of view, this mass generation in the  sector arises
from   condensed monopoles. To have  massless monopoles
before the superpotential is turned on, the right hand side of
the equation of the  curve
 must admit a special factorization,

 P^2_t(x) - 4^2t  = F_2(x)H_t-1 ^2(x),  

where we can assume that , , and  all have
leading coefficient 1.  Moreover, setting , we see
that if , we want  for some constant
. This problem leads to  possibilities for  and
, found by using Chebyshev polynomials.

Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kind of degree 
and  respectively are defined as follows.  (See Appendix C
for some explicit formulas.) Set  and let

 T _t(x) =(t)  U _t-1 (x) =1t  dT _tdx (x) = (t) ,  

the point being that  and
 are both polynomials in . Some
identities that can easily be checked are

 & T _t(x)^2 - 1  = (x^2 - 1)U _t-1 (x)^2   & T _t(x)   =12 ( (x+x^2-1 )^t +
 (x-x^2-1 )^t ).
   

 From the second identityTo prove this, write 
  it is clear
that the coefficient of  in  is .

The solutions to  areWe are making a slight refinement
of the formulas as they have been presented previously. 

 P_t(x) = 2^t^t T _t( x2 ),     F_2(x)=x^2-4^2^2,  
H_t-1 (x) = ^t-1 ^t-1  U _t-1 ( x2 ) , 

with  a -th root of unity, i.e. . Using
the fact that , one can see that  is a
function only of  and hence  gives us precisely the
expected  solutions of the factorization problem.

Using this, we can go back to the original problem of mapping
 solutions with a given superpotential, and some
renormalization scale , to  solutions with the
same superpotential and renormalization scale .

 By assumption,
we have polynomials ,  and , all
with leading coefficient 1, obeying the following relations:

P_N^2(x) - 4_0^2N &
=F_2n (x)H^2_N-n (x)F_2n (x)&=(W')^2+f_n-1 (x).  

 From , one can show that 
 with 
satisfies   2^tN ^tT _t(x) & = x^tN  + O (x^tN-1 ) (
2^tN ^t T _t(x))^2 - 4^2tN 
& = (P^2_N(x) -4^2^2N ) (
^t-1 ^N(t-1)  U _t-1 (x))^2  .   
Using  in the last equation with the identification
, one finds

( 2^tN ^t T _t(x))^2 - 4^2tN  = F_2n (x)
H^2_N-n (x)(^t-1 ^N(t-1)  U _t-1 (x))^2.  


The factorization problem for vacua of the  problem with
low energy gauge group  is

P_tN ^2(x) - 4^2tN  = F_2n (x)H_tN-n ^2(x).  

Comparison of  and  leads to the identification of

P_tN (x) & =  2^tN ^t
 T _t
 ( P_N(x)2^N  ) F_2n (x)& = F_2n (x)H_tN-n (x) & =
^t-1 ^N(t-1) H_N-n (x) U _t-1  (
P_N(x)2^N  )  

as solutions of .  Since , the vacua
constructed this way for the  theory have the same
superpotential as the vacua of the  theory.

For a given superpotential , the  theory has a finite
number of vacua with given .  This number is independent of
. For  different values of the  parameter
, namely
_0^2N =^2^2N ,  we have been able
to construct   vacua.  Thus, this construction gives 
times as many  vacua as there are  vacua. The
relation  shows that, to obtain  vacua in which the
-angle equals , the analogous angle
 of the  theory must be 
 for some integer .

This construction gives  branches in  for every branch
in , since the construction depends on the choice of
. Since we will show that the construction multiplies the
confinement index by , the counting of branches is in accord
with the observation in section 2.1 that Wilson and 't Hooft
loops can distinguish  types of branch with confinement index
.

Unbroken Gauge Group 

As a check of our formalism, let us see how the  vacua with
unbroken  arise by applying the multiplication by  map
to the unbroken vacua of .

In this case,  satisfies  with , i.e. it is
given by,




with .

Using this in , we get

 P_tN (x) = 2^tN ^t T _t(
 _0^N ^N ^N  T _N
( x2_0 )  )   

Using , one can easily check
that the combination 
 squares to one and can be pulled out of 
 giving a factor of 
. This implies that  can be written
as

 P_tN (x) = 2(_0)^tN  T _t(
 T _N
( x2_0 )  )   

Let us introduce  obeying
 as well as 
, and define . Finally,
using the identity 
in , one gets


 Recalling that  is a
-root of unity we get that  is a -root of
unity, and so is  since  is a -root of
unity. This, as we wished to show, is the expected solution of the
 problem.

Generating Function of Observables  

In section 2.1, a criterion for confinement was given in terms of
the operator-valued one-form constructed from the generating
function of ,

T(x) =  dx x- 
. 

Let us denote by  and  the one forms of 
and  respectively.

Recall that (according to Appendix A of )

 1x-  =
P'_tN (x) P^2_tN (x) - 4^2tN   . 

 From  and ,  we get

 P'_tN (x) = 2^t^tN  dxdx 
T '_t(x) = t ^t-1  P'_N(x) ^N(t-1) U _t-1 (x). 

Using this, , and , we get 1x-  = t P'_N(x)P_N^2(x)-4_0^2N   .   If we denote by  the
adjoint field in the  theory, then  can be written as

1x-  =
t1x- _0     

or equivalently .

So the multiplication by  map multiplies all periods of  by
.  Since the confinement index is the greatest common divisor
of the periods, it follows that this map multiplies the
confinement index by .  Since the  are certain periods of
, it follows also that the map multiplies the  by , as
originally shown in .


All The Confining Vacua 

As a special case, if we start with a Coulomb vacuum in ,
the multiplication by  map produces vacua with confinement
index  in .

The converse is also true: all vacua in   with confinement
index  arise in this way from Coulomb vacua in . This can
be shown by counting vacua.  Because of the freedom to choose
, the multiplication by  map produces  times as many
vacua  with confinement index  in  as there are Coulomb
vacua in .  Let us show that this is the correct number.

As explained in section 2.1, a Coulomb vacuum in  with a
classical limit based on  is specified by picking
some integers  with  and such that the
collection of the   and  are relatively
prime. Instead, to give a vacuum in  with classical limit
based on  and with confinement index , one must
pick some integers , ,
such that the collection  and 
 have greatest common divisor .  Any such 
are uniquely of the form  with 
 (and that formula works for any  and for any  that
solve the problem in ).  As there are  choices of ,
the number of  vacua with confinement index  should
indeed be  times the corresponding number of  Coulomb
vacua.


Further Strong Coupling Generalities 


Here we will consider some additional issues from the strong
coupling point of view, in which one starts with the solution of
the  theory and treats the superpotential as a small
perturbation.  The  dynamics is described by the curve
: y^2=P_N(x)^2-4^2N .  Here
.  Generically, the expectation value of
 breaks  to , and  has genus
. Its Jacobian determines the effective couplings of the
 low energy abelian vector multiplets.  Including the 
center of , which is free and not described by , the
low energy unbroken gauge group is .In this paper,
we will not require  to be traceless. So  describes
all chiral superfields, including the  partner of the
center of .  But the Jacobian of  describes the
gauge couplings only for the  gauge fields. When a
superpotential is turned on, the trace part of  interacts
with the other fields, but the  gauge field remains free. 

If the right hand side of  has  double roots, this
corresponds to existence of  independent massless monopoles.
After small perturbation by a generic superpotential, reducing
the supersymmetry to , the monopoles will condense,
reducing the low energy gauge group from  to .
So to describe a vacuum of the  theory with low
energy gauge group , we need  double zeroes of the
polynomial .



This polynomial factorizes
 P_N^2-4^2N =
 (P_N+2^N )(P_N-2^N ). 
The two factors  and  never vanish
simultaneously, so a double root is a double root of one factor or
the other.  To get  double roots, we therefore place 
double roots in one factor and  in the other factor, with
.  If  is given, there are  ways to pick 
and  with , so if all possibilities actually
occur, there are (at least)  branches of the moduli space of
vacua on which the rank of the unbroken group is .  In the
examples that we have looked at, all values of  and 
with  are possible - they all are realized for
some  order polynomial .  (Note that every 
is of the form  for some .)
We actually will meet cases with several branches for the same
 and .



This multiplicity of branches cannot, as far as we know, be
explained using conventional order parameters.  The exchange
 can be understood as a discrete chiral
symmetry of the  theory under which  changes
sign. In some cases (with  close to ) that we will study in
section 3, confinement goes a long way in explaining why there are
several branches. However, in general, chiral symmetries and
confinement (and any conventional order parameters we know) do not
suffice to explain why there are so many branches.  In section 4,
we study examples in which  is small compared to  and show
that the branches with different  and  can be
characterized according to which holomorphic functions of the
chiral order parameters vanish on a given branch.

Now let us explain something that will be useful background for
our computations in section 3.  Consider a family of 
vacua with  massless monopoles and given  (and
). As we take , can the theory converge
to a classical limit in which the unbroken gauge group is


If such a limit does exist, then for very small , the
 theories approximately decouple from each other.  Each
has its own polynomial  and its own mass scale
, and its own curve
. If each  theory
has  massless monopoles, we need  so that the
full theory has  massless monopoles.  But in , the
maximum possible number of massless monopoles is , and
since , we must in fact have 
for all .

The particular polynomials  such that
 has  double roots are known
explicitly in terms of Chebyshev polynomials  and were
used in section 2.3. Even without recalling the details, we can
determine what numbers  and  of double roots of
 are possible if
. A polynomial of degree  has at most
 double roots, so . If  is
odd, the only possibility is , and if
 is even, there are two cases
 or .

Finally we can answer our question of which classical limits can
exist for given .  A branch of given  and  can
have a classical limit with unbroken  only if
one can write  , with 
 and . The above
argument shows that this condition is necessary; in examples that
we have studied, it is also sufficient.  For example, in section
3, we will examine in detail the case of  with , so
. For  or , our conditions only
allow the classical limit , in agreement with
what we will find. But for , they allow
, , and , all
of which will duly appear.

Intersections of Branches 

Now let us consider whether different branches might meet at
singularities. For example, can a branch  with
 meet a branch  with
? This will naturally occur at a point with
 massless monopoles and . Such a point is
on both  and , as well as being on a branch 
with  massless monopoles. So in general, distinct branches
with "adjacent" values of  will meet at singular
points with an extra massless monopole.

Such a singularity corresponds to shrinking a cycle in the
Riemann surface of the  theory.  From  it is
clear that the differential  cannot have a pole.
Therefore, a cycle can shrink only if  the period of 
around it vanishes.  This leads to restrictions on the
possible singularities in a branch.  Similar restrictions
have been pointed out in .   They do not affect
the examples we study below because even if  around
a certain cycle is not zero, we can find another cycle with
vanishing period which can be shrunk.

Here we have described the situation in an 
language.  From an  point of view, the situation is
different.  For a given branch with given , the superpotential
that leads to a given  curve on the branch can be
found by the recipe of , reviewed in section 2.2.  (It
generically triggers condensation of all the massless monopoles.)
For simplicity, we assume that on the branches  and
,  so the superpotential is uniquely determined. The
superpotential needed to get a given  curve on a
branch with  is generically different from the
superpotential needed to get the same curve on a branch with
.  So this type of intersection of branches
is not really relevant for , which is our main
interest in the present paper.

What is more relevant for  is that a branch 
with  meets a branch  with
 at a point with an extra double root.  (An
example was discussed in .)The branch 
 likewise meets the branch  with
; as we have just explained, this occurs with
the same  curve but a different superpotential from
the one that leads to  intersecting . 

The notion of  and  "meeting" may seem
confusing since from an  point of view, 
is just a subspace of  singled out by existence of an
extra double root.  So let us elaborate.
  actually has a reduced rank of the low energy gauge
group , so on this branch the superpotential is not
uniquely determined by the  curve, but depends on one
extra complex parameter.  This parameter controls the
condensation of the massless monopole that appeared when
 developed an extra double root.  This
parameter should be included in describing the 
branch from an  point of view.  Thus, from an  point
of view,  is not a subspace of , and in fact
they have the same dimension.

Starting on , the intersection with  is
obtained by adjusting the  curve to get an extra double
root.  Starting from  (at a generic point where  the
extra monopole is condensed), the intersection is reached by
varying the superpotential until it becomes the 
superpotential for the same  curve.



For this to make sense, we need to know that the 
superpotential of any  curve with 
is always one of the allowed superpotentials that can lead to
that curve on .  This can readily be shown from the
generalized  recipe for the superpotential that was
presented in section 2.2 (see  and the discussion following
it).

Sometimes it will happen that the branch  is confining
while  is not confining (or has a smaller confinement
index).  If so, then as one approaches the intersection of the
two branches starting on , the coefficient of the area
law must vanish (as noted in an example in ).

Actually, a point with  is on an -fold
self-intersection of , since there are  different ways
to forget a double root of , leaving  of them.
Such a point is likewise on a -fold self-intersection of
.   However, the different branches do not really meet as
 theories, since they would require different
superpotentials.


Though in the present paper we focus on double roots of
, it is also possible to consider the case of
triple or higher order roots.  The first example was studied by
Argyres and Douglas .  At the  level,
before turning on a superpotential, these configurations are
believed to correspond to non-trivial critical points.  What
happens if a superpotential is turned on, breaking to 
?  A generic superpotential will not be extremal at a point
with a triple root, but by tuning parameters to get a
superpotential that is extremal at such a point, one can
presumably get a nontrivial critical point with 
supersymmetry.

Off-shell Interpolation 

Most of this paper is devoted to the question of branches of
physical vacua.  As the parameters in  are varied, the
vacua change and we explore the various branches and the smooth
interpolation from one vacuum to another within a branch.  These
are on-shell interpolations.  It is interesting to ask whether
there exists a Lagrangian which allows us to extrapolate between
the different branches.

This question can be answered at various levels. The most
complete description of the theory is in terms of the microscopic
gauge theory.  It describes all the vacua of the theory.

A more macroscopic description is the effective Lagrangian of
 for the fields .  The vacua are found by solving the
equations of motion of .  As we vary the parameters in
, these vacua change and we find the on-shell
interpolation.  One of our results is that we can continuously
interpolate between vacua with one value of  to vacua with
other values of .  Therefore, the superpotential of 
has many stationary points corresponding to the different vacua
with different  on the same branch.  We will see examples of
this in the next section.



Another type of an effective Lagrangian we can consider is the
following.  The effective Lagrangian for a given branch has the
form 
 _i N_i S_i ((^3  S_i )+ 1) + 2i b_i S_i + _iN_i(S_jS_k) 
(we absorbed  into  and ). We can replace
it with
 _i S_i ((^3N_i    S_i^N_i   )+ N_i ) +_iN_i(S_jS_k). 
As we explained in section 2.1, this superpotential has more
stationary points than .  For small  it has 
 vacua, rather than a single vacuum.  Therefore, it describes
different branches, some of them can be confining and others can
be in a Coulomb phase.  A superpotential like  might be
a good effective Lagrangian for all vacua for a given  for
small , i.e. at weak coupling.  However, it is unlikely to
describe the proper interpolation to large  where vacua with
different values of  are present.

Examples 

In this section, we will analyze several explicit examples
demonstrating the phenomena we have discussed.  In the first five
subsections, we will study examples with gauge group  for
 and with low rank of the low energy gauge group. The
case that the rank is  is too trivial for our purposes; this
means that  is unbroken classically.  The corresponding
 curves are described by Chebyshev polynomials and
were reviewed in section 2.3.  We focus therefore on the next case
that the low energy group has rank ; thus, classically 
is broken to , and the question arises of
whether smooth interpolation can occur between different pairs
.  In section 3.6, we present some special examples
with .

For each , the "new" vacua are the Coulomb vacua, since
according to the discussion in section 2.3, the confining vacua
with confinement index  are determined by what happened for
.  In our systematic construction of all vacua with 
for given , we will come across all vacua, both Coulomb and
confining.  For the range of  we consider, interpolation
between different pairs  occurs only for Coulomb vacua,
simply because (if )  is always too small for such
interpolation to be possible in .


We will analyze the theory along the following steps.  We start
by considering the   gauge theory whose Coulomb
branch is described by the hyper-elliptic curve
 y^2=P_N(x)^2 -4 ^2N =(P_N(x)+ 2^N)
 (P_N(x)- 2 ^N ) 
where the  order polynomial 
parameterizes the point in the moduli space.  This point is
labeled by the  eigenvalues of the matrix  modulo
permutations.

To get , the  theory must have   massless
magnetic monopoles, so the polynomial  must have  double
roots.  Since  depends on  complex parameters, the
subspace on which  has  double roots is
two-dimensional. As discussed in section 2.4, the distribution of
double roots between the two factors in  is labeled by two
integers. There are  double roots in the first factor and
 double roots in the second factor. The two integers 
and  must satisfy  and .
Different values of  and  correspond to different
branches.

After picking values of  and  we solve the factorization
problem
 
 &P_N(x)+ 2^N=H_s_+ ^2(x) R_N-2s_+ (x)  &P_N(x) - 2 ^N=H_s_- ^2(x) R_N-2s_- (x)  
with polynomials , ,  and
, where the subscript of the polynomial denotes
its degree.  We normalize the coefficient of the highest power of
 in each polynomial to be one, and solve for the other
coefficients such that
 H_s_+ ^2(x)R_N-2s_+ (x)-4^N= H_s_- ^2(x) R_N-2s_- (x). 
We will see in the examples below that often there are several
distinct branches for the same .

The moduli space  is parametrized by the coefficients in the
polynomials , ,  and 
. As we mentioned above,  is two dimensional. In
solving the factorization problem , we will sometimes shift
 by a constant in order to simplify the equations. This
constant can trivially be reinstated at the end of the
calculation.  Ignoring this constant, our moduli space is one
dimensional.

We then examine the semiclassical limit . Since we
limit ourselves to the case , in the classical limit the
microscopic  gauge group is broken to 
.  We want to determine for each branch  of the
moduli space what values of  and  are possible.

We will also study singular points on . Triple roots
of  lead to Argyres-Douglas points . We will not
determine them here.  We will focus on singularities in which
 has a new double root. These occur when either
 or  acquire a double root. This
means that these points have  or 
double roots in the two branches. At these subspaces, there are
 massless monopoles. As explained in section 2.4, at these
points  meets a branch with , i.e., the fully
confined branch that classically has unbroken .

We then break  to  by turning on a tree level
superpotential which leads to a vacuum at a point on ;
this lifts the degeneracy of , and only a finite set
of vacua survive for given superpotential. We want to determine
what superpotential can lead to a given point on the moduli space.
Since , the superpotential must have at least two critical
points, and to keep things simple we will consider the case of a
cubic superpotential, which has exactly two critical points.  In
section 2.2, we reviewed the recipe of  for determining what
cubic superpotential, normalized to have leading term ,
leads to a given point on the  moduli space. We take the
matrix model curve, which in this case is
 y_m^2=R_N-2s_+ (x) R_N-2s_- (x), 
and we write R_N-2s_+ (x) R_N-2s_- (x) =W'(x)^2
+ f_1(x).  Recall that , and therefore the left hand
side of   is a quartic polynomial.  determines ,
and hence determines  up to an irrelevant additive constant.
Moreover, the value of the gluino bilinear  can be read off
from ; if , then .

The intersection  points of different branches are points where
 has a double root and therefore equation 
describes a genus zero curve. This is consistent with the fact
that such points are also on the  branch because, as
explained in section 2.2, when  (here ), the matrix
model curve has double zeros. The physics of these points in the
 theory is interesting. The low energy spectrum at these
points consists of the two  multiplets which exist at
generic points in  as well as another massless
monopole. Moving away from this point along , this
monopole acquires a mass.  Moving away from this point through
the condensation of this monopole takes us to the fully confining
vacua with unbroken  and only a single massless 
multiplet.

If we denote the critical points of  as  and , we
have
 W'=(x-x_1)(x-x_2). 
The physics is essentially unchanged by adding a constant to ,
which shifts  and  by a constant. The invariant
information contained in the choice of , modulo shifting 
and exchanging the two critical points, is contained in the
parameter
 (x_1-x_2)^2. 
It is possible and sometimes convenient to shift  so that a
superpotential of given  takes the form
 W=x^33 -4  x. 
 is odd under the transformation , which thus
corresponds to an -symmetry.  (Of course, the symmetry is
present whether or not we shift  to put  in the form
.)  The critical points  are exchanged by  the
symmetry, so a choice of classical vacuum with 
spontaneously breaks the symmetry.  In some examples, the
symmetry exchanges different branches , and in other
cases, it acts within a fixed branch.

The matrix model formulas can be used to compute .  Though
we will not do this in detail, it could be done as follows.
Following ,
 T(x)=dx x-  =P_N'(x)P_N^2(x) -4^2N   dx. 
 From 
 
 P_N'(x) &=H_s_+ (x)(2 H_s_+ '(x)R_N-2s_+ (x)+H_s_+ 
 (x)R_N-2s_+ '(x))  & =H_s_- (x)(2 H_s_- '(x) R_N-2s_- (x)+ H_s_-  (x)R_N-2s_- '(x)) & = -14  c(x) H_s_+ (x)H_s_- (x).  
Since we learn from the first two expressions that  is
divisible by  and ,  must be
a polynomial (the factor of  is in order to agree with the
conventions of ).  Therefore  can be written as
 T(x)=-c(x) 4y_m dx 
which leads to the identification 
 in .

In some of our examples, we will find , and find that this
can be interpreted as a consequence of the symmetry. However, the
symmetry is special to a cubic superpotential. A generic
superpotential of higher degree does not have such a symmetry and
it can still lead on certain branches to , as we will
demonstrate in section 3.6. Lacking such a symmetry, vanishing of
 on a branch of vacua would not be natural in a
nonsupersymmetric  field theory. With supersymmetry, such
"unnatural" phenomena can be dictated by holomorphy. In section
4, we discuss more elaborate examples of such phenomena.

Let us consider the examples.


 

Our first example is a  gauge theory.  The hyper-elliptic
curve  is
 y^2=(P_2(x) + 2^2)(P_2(x) - 2 ^2 ). 
The factorization problem  in this case is quite trivial,
since to get  we do not need double roots at all - just the
classical symmetry breaking . We write
 P_2(x)  = (x-a) (x-b)   
Our moduli space  with  is parametrized by  and 
modulo the exchange . In other words, it is
the whole  Coulomb branch.

The semiclassical limit  is also trivial since
 is independent of . Setting
, we find 
, breaking  to .

The subspace with a massless monopole is determined by looking for
points where  has a double roots.  This happens when
 (a-b)^2 = 8 ^2. 
These subspaces are also on the unbroken  branch
corresponding to . If we shift  such that  (as in
), at these points
 P_2(x)=x^22^2,  y^2=x^2(x^2 4^4). 
Note that   with ; this is
equal to 
from section 2.3.  After a small perturbation causing the
monopoles to condense, one of these points has confinement and
one has oblique confinement.

We now break  to  by turning on a cubic
superpotential chosen to put the system at the point . We
find it through the matrix model curve
 y_m^2 = P_2^2-4^4=((x-a) (x-b))^2
   -4 ^4 
from which we derive
 
 W'(x) &=(x-a)(x-b)  f(x)&=-4^4  S &=0 .   
In this case, vanishing of  can be attributed to the discrete
chiral symmetry.

If  is given,  determines  and  modulo the
exchange .  Since the moduli space is obtained
by dividing out by this exchange, there is in this example only
one vacuum for given .  This occurs whenever all  are 1,
as then there is no strong dynamics at low energies.

 

Our next example is somewhat more interesting.  It is based on
the gauge group .

We start by finding the subspace of the  moduli space with
one monopole.  The  curve
 y^2=(P_3(x) + 2^3)(P_3(x) - 2 ^3 ) 
should have a single double root.  The solution of this problem
has two branches labeled by  depending on which factor
of  has the double root; i.e.  or
.  In either case, the factorization we need is
 
 &P_3(x) + 2 ^3 = (x-a)^2 (x-b),   
 implying also
 P_3(x) - 2 ^3 = (x-a)^2 (x-b)
-4^3.  As in the previous example,  and  are the
parameters on the moduli space; now there is no symmetry
exchanging them.

The semiclassical limit  leads to 
 and therefore it corresponds to  broken to
.  The existence of two branches - via the
choice of  - has a simple explanation: the  that is
unbroken classically is strongly coupled at low energies and has
two supersymmetric vacua, corresponding in our problem to the two
branches.

Each branch has three one-dimensional subspaces with one more
massless monopole.  They are determined by looking for points
where  has two double roots.  This happens when
 (a-b)^3 = 27 ^3. 
Since these points have , at these points the two
branches labeled by  meet each other, and they also meet
the  subspace of the  moduli space.  Therefore, they
can be interpreted as unbroken  vacua, in keeping with the
discussion in section 2.4.  In fact, once we impose  in the
form  with  and shift 
,  becomes 
which is equal to 
 from section 2.3.

We now break  to  by turning on a superpotential
which puts the system at the point  in the  moduli
space.  We find it through the matrix model curve, as in :
 y_m^2 =(x-b) ((x-a)^2 (x-b)  -4^3
 ) = ((x-a)(x-b))^2 -4^3(x-b). 
 From this we derive
 
 W'(x) &=(x-a)(x-b)  f(x)&=-4^3(x-b)  S &=^3.   

For fixed superpotential, there are two values of . Either
of them can be the double root of , and the
vacuum also depends on the choice of .  So for each tree
level superpotential, the system has four vacua with low energy
gauge group . Semiclassically, they can be interpreted as
follows. First, the unbroken  can be associated with either
one of the two different minima of the potential, spontaneously
breaking the global  symmetry. Each of these choices
leads from the strong coupling  dynamics to two vacua,
which differ by the sign of .

 

We now repeat the same analysis for .  We look for the
subspace of the  theory with  magnetic
monopoles. The two double roots of the  curve
 y^2=(P_4(x)^2 + 2^4)(P_4(x)^2 - 2 ^4) 
can be distributed between the two factors as ,
 or .

Confining Branches, Monopoles Distributed As 
 or  

With both double roots in the same factor of ,
we get two branches, labeled by the choice of :
  
 &P_4(x) + 2 ^4= (x^2-ax +b)^2  &P_4(x) - 2 ^4 = (x^2-ax +b)^2 -4^4.  

The semiclassical limit of   leads to 
, which has two double roots, so  is broken to
.  That this is the only classical limit for
 or  could be predicted from the reasoning
in section 2.4.

Each branch has four singular subspaces with another massless
monopole, i.e., on which   also has a
double root. This happens at the solutions of
 (4b-a^2)^2=64^4. 
These points correspond to  or , so they
are on the branch with  and unbroken .

As in , the matrix model curve is
 y_m^2=(x^2-ax +b)^2 -4^4 
from which we derive
 
 W'(x) &=x^2-ax+b  f(x)&=-4^4  S &=0.  
We see that for each superpotential, we have two vacua (labeled by
), one on each branch.  This can be understood
semiclassically as follows.  The low energy  is
characterized by scales which are given in the semiclassical limit
by .
Gluino condensation in these groups leads to four vacua 
, . The
 exchanges  and , and since it is an -symmetry,
it acts by .  There should therefore be
two -invariant vacua, with  and ; these are
evidently
 the vacua that we have found on the branches with 
 or .  We will clearly have to find the two
vacua with  and  elsewhere.

Of the four  vacua, the analysis of section 2.1
shows that two are confining and two are in a Coulomb phase. In
fact, the vacua that we have found are confining, because the
branch that we have just described can be constructed by
"multiplication by 2," of  as in section 2.3,

 P_4(x) = 2^4^2 T _2
(P_2(x)2^2   )  

with  and . This is the same as .

Coulomb Branch, Monopoles Distributed as 
 

The other branch occurs when each of the factors 
 has a single double root.  It is not too hard to show
that, modulo the freedom to add a constant to , this implies
that
  
  &P_4(x) + 2 ^4= (x-a)^2[(x+a)^2 +^4   a^3 (x +2a)]   &P_4(x) - 2 ^4 =(x+a)^2[( x-a)^2 +^4   a^3 (x -2a)  ]  
for some .

There now are two semiclassical limits with :
1.  Fixed : .
Therefore  is broken to .
2.   with fixed :
, showing that here  is broken to 
.

This is the first example of our new duality: the same moduli
space has two distinct semiclassical limits corresponding to
different gauge groups.  One can continuously deform a
 vacuum to a  vacuum.

Since the numbers 1 and 3 are relatively prime, these 
 vacua are all in a Coulomb phase.  This whole branch is
therefore in a Coulomb phase, and the classical limit with 
 will turn out to give the two 
vacua that did not appear earlier. The upshot will be
 that  vacua that are
in a Coulomb phase can be smoothly transformed to 
 vacua, while confining  vacua cannot make
such a transformation, since there are no confining 
 vacua.

The special points on this branch where another monopole becomes
massless are at the solutions of
 16 a^8 = ^8. 
Explicitly,  with .
Note that shifting  and using the
solutions to  we get from  that 
. These are the same
four points that we found in .

 From , we find the matrix model curve, as in :
 
 y_m^2= &[(x+a)^2 +^4 a^3 (x +2a)]
 [( x-a)^2 +^4 a^3 (x -2a)  ]  = &(x^2 + x^4 a^3 -a^2 )^2
   - 4^4a x -4^8 a^4 .  
The superpotential and  are therefore
 
 W'(x)&=x^2 + x^4 a^3 -a^2  f(x)&=-  4^4a x -4^8 a^4   S&=^4a .  

Finally, we count the number of vacua for fixed tree level
superpotential.  The most convenient way to proceed is to compute
the discriminant of the quadratic polynomial 
; it is ^8a^6 .  By
shifting , we could put the superpotential in the form
.  If  is given, then  is equivalent to an
eighth order equation for , namely
 4a^8-a^6+ ^8=0. 
So there are eight possible values of  for every ,
implying that the theory has eight vacua for each tree level
superpotential.  In the semiclassical limit of large
, these vacua can be understood as follows:
1.   leads to  vacua.
The factor of  arises from the broken global symmetry which
exchanges the two minima of the potential.  Indeed, for large
,  has six roots with 
.
2.   leads to  vacua.  Here
we do not need to include the factor of  which exchanges the
two minima of the potential and we subtract the two confining
vacua that we found on other branches.  To check this prediction,
we see that for large ,  has two roots
with .

 

 To find points on the Coulomb branch for  with three
 massless monopoles,
we want polynomials  such that
  y^2 = (P_5(x) +2^5) (P_5(x) - 2^5)  
has  double zeros.  This leads to two branches with
 or .   We will label them by 
.   should have a pair of double roots, and
 should have a single double root; we use the
freedom of shifting  to place this double root at the origin.
Requiring the existence of the stated double roots leads to
 
 P_5(x) + 2^5 = & (x^2+a x-2ac)^2(x+c) P_5(x) - 2^5 = & x^2[x^3+(2a+c)x^2 + a(a-2c)
 x-ac(3a+4c)]    
where the parameters  and  are constrained to satisfy

 a^2 c^3 = ^5 . 


 From  it is clear that there are two classical limits: as
, either   or . In the former case,
 corresponding to  while in
the latter,  giving .  This
is another example showing that the same branch can have different
classical limits.  (If we let both  and  to to zero, we will
get , corresponding to a classical limit with unbroken
.)

The points with another massless monopole correspond to
.  They occur when  has
two double roots.  This happens when  subject
to the constraint . Solving for  we get,

  c = 12  (11+ 5 5  ) a  with  ^2=1  

and

  a^5 = (-682+3055 )^5=
 (-2+5 )^5 ^5 . 
Equation   has 10 solutions for each 
 a=(-2+5 ),  ^5=. 
However, using the freedom to shift  such as to cancel the
 term in  (bring it to the  form), 
,  becomes
 
 P_5(x) + 2^5 = & ( x+2) (
 x^2- x- ^2^2 )^2 P_5(x) - 2^5 = &  ( x-2)(
 x^2 + x - ^2^2  )^2
    
 from which it is clear that there are only 5 different points
on each branch. Note that this is equal to 
 from section
2.3.

Why has the same   appeared for two different values of the
pair ?  These values of  are characterized by the
fact that  has a second double root - but
there are two choices of which double root is the "second" one.



 Using the recipe of , we identify the matrix model curve,
 y_m^2=
 (x+c)[x^3+(2a+c)x^2+a(a-2c)x-ac(3a+4c)]. 
 From this we find


 W'(x) = & x^2+(a+c)x-ac    f(x) = &-4c^2 a(x+a+c)   S  = &c^2 a.  


Finally, we count the number of vacua for fixed tree level
superpotential, by the same reasoning as in previous examples. By
computing the discriminant of , we get .
Using  to solve for , we find that for fixed 
there are 20 vacua, corresponding to the roots of

  a^8(a^2-)^6 - 2a^4(17 a^2+)(1153 a^4
 + 142 a^2 + ^2) ^10  + ^20 = 0. 

In the semiclassical limit of large , these
vacua can be understood as follows:
1.   leads to  vacua,
with .
2.   leads to  vacua,
which are at roughly .

We have not found any confining branches for  for the simple
reason that 5 is a prime number, so if , then 
and  are relatively prime. Hence for , all vacua are
 in a Coulomb phase.

 

 is the last and richest example that we will examine in
detail. We look for points in the Coulomb branch of the 
 theory with  double zeros. These can be
distributed between the two factors of
 y^2= P_6(x)^2-4^12  = (P_6(x)-2^6)
 (P_6(x)+2^6) 
as ,  or .

Confining  Branches, Monopoles
Distributed As  or  


We first wish to consider the branches of the moduli space of
 with four massless magnetic monopoles distributed as
 and  between the two factors. The solution of the
factorization problem  is

 
 P_6(x) +2^6 & = [ (x-a)^2(x-b)-2 ^3 ]^2  P_6(x) -2^6 & = (x-a)^2 (x-b)[ (x-a)^2(x-b)
 -4^3 ]
     

with  and .

The semiclassical limit  leads to 
, and therefore  is broken to 
.  That this is the only semi-classical limit with 
 or  follows from the reasoning in section 2.4.

The points with another massless monopole occur when 
 has two double roots. This happens when 
.  These special points on the 
branches have ; they also meet the 
 branches we will discuss below and the  branch with
. The special points on the  branches have
 and they meet the  branches
and the  branch.

Using , the matrix model curve is found from  to be
 y_m^2=(x-a)^2(x-b)^2 -4^3(x-b)  .  
 From this we derive
   W'(x)= & (x-a)(x-b)                     f(x) = & -4^3 (x-b)           S = &^3  .    

For fixed superpotential  there are 8 solutions.
They correspond to the four solutions of  for each
choice of . In the semiclassical limit
these 8 vacua can be understood as follows. 
gives a total of  vacua, where 
 reflects the strong dynamics and a factor of 2 comes from the
broken  symmetry. But, following the analysis in
section 2.1, only half of these vacua (those with  even) are
confining.  So we expect 8 confining vacua.

The eight vacua with  or  actually are
confining, since they can be obtained by  applying the
"multiplication by 2" map to the polynomial
 with , which
describes the breaking  (and was
presented in ). Following the general discussion of section
2.3, the scales of the theories are related by 
 with . Using this in

 we recover  with 
.


Confining  Branches, Monopoles
Distributed as  

We now consider the case of .  In this case, the
factorization problem  has two types of solution. The first
case leads to three branches parametrized by a cube root of unity

 
 &P_6(x)+2^6=(x^2+g -^2)^2 (x^2+g +
 2^2)  &P_6(x)-2^6=(x^2 + g+^2)^2
 (x^2+g-2^2)   &P_6(x)=(x^2 + g)[(x^2+g)^2 -3^2^4].  
These three branches are distinct.  Since  depends on
 and not on , the change 
 (and therefore ) does not
lead to more branches. Instead, there is a global symmetry 
 which acts on each branch.

In the classical limit  we have 
 and therefore  is broken to .
On each of these branches there are two " points" -
points with five double roots: .

We now break  to  by turning on a superpotential 
which puts the system in the ground state labeled by .  It is
determined from the matrix model curve, which is found, as in
, from :
 y_m^2= (x^2+g + 2^2) (x^2+g -
 2^2) =(x^2+g)^2 - 4^2^4. 
 From this, we find

  W'(x)= & x^2+g                        f(x)= & -4^2 ^4                     S  = & 0.      

These expressions are consistent with the  R-symmetry
which maps  and .

 From the expression , it is clear that 
determines  and hence , so for fixed , there is a
single quantum vacuum on each branch. The three branches give a
total of three vacua. Semiclassically, these  can be interpreted
as coming from , with the two gluino
condensates in the two  factors anti-aligned.  As in the
discussion after  of , this leads
to , which respects the global  R-symmetry
of the system.

 is expected to give a total of 
vacua, but according to the analysis in section 2.1, only 3 of
them (those with ) are confining.  We claim that the three
vacua obtained by the construction above are confining. In fact,
they can be obtained by the "multiplication by 3" of 
 which is a solution to . One can
check that 
 reproduces  with 
 and  cubic roots of unity.

The fact that these three branches are confining, with a
confinement index of 3, explains why they have no semi-classical
limit with  or .  There are
three branches for a reason explained in section 2.1; they are
distinguished by which of , for , has  no area law.

Coulomb Branch, Monopoles Distributed as 
 

The second kind of solution of the factorization problem 
in this case is
 
 &P_6(x)+2^6= [x^2 + (h+g)x+(3h+g)(9h^3+15h^2g -hg^2+g^3)
 108 h^2 ]^2 & [x^2 -(h-g)(3h-g)^2(3h+g)108
 h^2 ] &P_6(x)-2^6= [(x+2g3 )^2 + (h-g)(x+2g3 )
 +(3h-g)(9h^3-15h^2g -hg^2-g^3) 108 h^2 ]^2 &[(x+2g3 )^2
 -(h+g)(3h+g)^2(3h-g)108 h^2 ]  
with  and  satisfying the constraint
 g^5(g^2-9h^2)^2 = 27^3h^3^6. 
We used a parametrization which makes the global symmetry 
 combined with  manifest.

The classical limit  is obtained at:
1.   with finite . Here 
; i.e. 
.
2.   with finite .  Here 
; i.e. .
3.   with finite .  Here 
; i.e. .
4.   with  fixed.  Here 
; i.e. .

This is a richer example demonstrating that the same branch can
have different classical limits.  Since 1 and 5 are relatively
prime, what we have found is clearly a Coulomb branch.

The  points are obtained when either 
or  acquires another double zero.  This
happens when
 (h+ g)(3h+ g)^2(3h -g)108 h^2 =0 
or the same equation with . Taking into account
, this happens only for
 h=gwith   g  a  solution  of 
 (2g)^6 = 27^3^6 
or
 h=-gwith   g  a  solution  of 
 (2g)^6 = -27^3^6. 
Superficially, this leads to 12 points.  However (after an
appropriate shift of ) one finds that at these points 
 depend only on  and therefore there are only
6 such points. Indeed, both solutions lead to 
 with
. At these points, this branch meets the various
confining branches that we have found.

We now break  to  by turning on a superpotential
.  It is determined from the matrix model curve
  y_m^2= &[x^2
 -(h-g)(3h-g)^2(3h+g)108 h^2 ] [(x+2g 3 )^2 -(h+g)(3h+g)^2(3h-g)108 h^2 ]  = & (x^2 + 23   g x + g^4 - 6 g^2 h^2 - 27 h^4
 108 h^2 )^2 - 4 g^2(g^2 - 9 h^2)81h  x +2 g^2
 (g - 3 h)^3(g + 3 h) 729 h^2 
    
and therefore
 
 W'(x) &=x^2 + 2g3  x + g^4 - 6g^2 h^2 - 27 h^4  108 h^2  =x^2 + g^4-18g^2h^2  - 27 h^4  108 h^2   f(x) & = - 4 g^2(g^2 - 9 h^2)81h x +2 g^2
 (g - 3 h)^3(g + 3 h) 729 h^2  = - 4 g^2(g ^2- 9 h^2)
 81h  x +2 g^2 (g^4 - 81 h^4)729 h^2   S & =g^2(g^2 - 9 h^2)81h   .   
We used the freedom to shift  by  to
put the superpotential  in a canonical form 
.

We would like to parametrize the theory in terms of .
Including the constraint , we have two equations with
two unknowns:
 
 &27 h^4-g^4+18g^2h^2  27 h^2   &g^5(g^2-9h^2)^2 = 27^3h^3^6. 
  
Using these equations we can solve for ,
 h= 4g^5(16g^10 (g^2-94 )^2 - 3(9 4 ) (3)^12  )9(3)^6 (32 g^10 (g^2 -
 34 )  + 3(3)^12 )  
and find a single equation for a single unknown ,
  g^16 (g^2-94  )^4  =(3
 )^12  ( 98  g^12  - 38 
 (94 )^2 g^8
 +1 4 (94  )^3g^6 +27
 256 (3)^12 ). 
In deriving this equation we assumed that .

Since the final constraint  is of degree 24, for fixed
superpotential (fixed ) there are 24 vacua. These can be
interpreted as follows:
1.    vacua. Their number is
 (the factor of 2 is associated with the
global  symmetry of the theory).
2.   vacua.  Their number is
  (we subtracted the 8 confining vacua).
3.   vacua.
Their number is  (we subtracted the 3 confining
vacua, and we did not multiply by 2 because for 
the  symmetry is not broken).

It is interesting to contrast this situation with the classical
theory ().  Here we find 3 solutions: 
.  The corresponding values of  depend
on the details of the limit.  The two solutions with 
 correspond to  vacua
(compare with the analysis of the semiclassical limits above).
Each of them splits to 4 vacua in the quantum theory.  The
solution  corresponds to  and to 
.  This point splits in the quantum theory to 16 vacua
(compare with the analysis of the semiclassical limits above).

Examples with  

This completes what we will say by way of systematic analysis for
relatively small . In this subsection, we study another kind of
example in which the factorization problem is easily solved
explicitly.  This is the case that all the double roots are in one
factor of the  curve - for example,  and therefore
. There is an analogous discussion for . The
condition  shows that this is possible only when
. The factorization problem is solved by
 
 &P_N(x) + 2^N=H_s_+ ^2(x) R_N-2s_+ (x)  &P_N(x) - 2 ^N=H_s_+ ^2(x) R_N-2s_+ (x) -4^N   
with arbitrary coefficients in  and
.

 From , we easily find the semiclassical limit
 P_N(x) H_s_+ ^2(x) R_N-2s_+ (x). 
We see that  is broken to .

 From  the matrix model curve is
 y_m^2=R_N-2s_+ (x)[H_s_+ ^2(x) R_N-2s_+ (x)
 -4^N ]=[H_s_+ (x) R_N-2s_+ (x)]^2
 -4^N R_N-2s_+ (x). 

If , the degree of  is 
, and we immediately find the superpotential and :
 
 W'(x)= &H_s_+ (x) R_N-2s_+ (x) f(x)= &-4^N R_N-2s_+ (x)  
If , the degree of  is smaller than  and we
conclude that .


We have seen an example of this when we studied  with 
above with .  As a more interesting example,
consider  with  and therefore .
Following the general solution , we find
 
 &P_5(x) + 2^5=(x^2+ax+b)^2(x+c)  &P_5(x) - 2 ^N=(x^2+ax+b)^2(x+c) -4^5.   
In the semiclassical limit, , and
therefore  is broken to .

 From  ,, we deduce
 
 y_m^2= &[(x^2+ax+b)(x+c)]^2 -4^5 (x+c)   W'(x)= & (x^2+ax+b)(x+c)  f(x)= &-4^5  (x+c) S= & 0.  
The theory has a quartic superpotential, and therefore there is no
global symmetry.  Yet we still find .  This is a special case
of a more general phenomenon we will see in the next section.

Interpolation and duality 

As discussed in section 2.4, a given branch, Coulomb or confining, can have
different classical limits. We have given explicit examples of
the interpolation between classical limits  and
.  Since the  are certain periods of
the one-form , such an interpolation must involve a rearrangement of the compact
one-cycles on the Riemann surface.
With some numerical work, we have determined how this happens in all the examples
of section 3.  Here we will simply illustrate the result qualitatively, without
attempting any proofs.   In the process, we will
see that the two descriptions are related to each other through an
electric-magnetic duality.

For a general breaking pattern , there are  compact
cycles, as sketched (for ) in figures 1 and 2.  There are  cycles 
that in a weak coupling limit surround a pair of roots, and  cycles  that
connect neighboring pairs.  The intersection numbers are ,
 .
In particular, the sum 
is a null vector.  In fact, it is clear from figure 1 that this cycle is homologous to
a cycle at infinity that winds once around the whole -plane; this cycle will
not be affected by the motion of the roots. So the null vector  will be  invariant
under the monodromy.   If the action of the monodromies on  and ,
, is known, then the behavior of  is determined using the fact that  is
invariant.

To illustrate, we will examine examples with . In this case, there are just three
cycles, , , and .  If we know what happens to  and , the
behavior of  is known.  Given the intersection relations of  and ,
the monodromies must act on them by an  transformations plus possible
addition of a multiple of the null vector .  (The null vector is
uniquely determined by the fact that the  are  non-negative.)

Now we will sketch the  mechanism of
interpolation we found to operate in all examples.
These branches all have complex dimension two, but one complex parameter
is associated with
the freedom of shifting  in . This parameter can be removed,
leaving only a space with complex dimension one.
We want to discuss how the zeroes of  move and the cycles evolve
as one interpolates from a classical limit with unbroken  to
a classical limit with .


We start in the semiclassical limit with the group . As
discussed in section 2, the polynomial  is given in
this limit in terms of the Chebyshev polynomials of the two factors 
and . Each factor leads to  double roots and two single roots.
This is depicted in figure 4a for .

 four single roots (labeled 1,2,3 and 4) and two double roots; single

As we vary the superpotential to go to a strongly coupled region,
 the two groups mix (figures 4b and 4c)
and the zeroes then separate
into two new groups (figure 4d).  One group has two single roots and
 double roots, and the other has two single roots and  double
roots.

It is easy to see the way the cycles are transformed.  Following the steps from
figure 4a to figure 4d,  evolves into  and  evolves into .
We can describe this by the monodromy matrix

 A_1 C  =
 0 & 1 -1 & 0   A_1 C  .  

In this example, with this choice of cycles, the monodromy is in , with no
addition of a null vector.  In fact,
the transformation matrix in 
is the  generator of , revealing the electric-magnetic nature
of the duality.  Since
  , it follows from the above that
 A_2 = A_1 + A_2 - C. 


Since  and , we have
 N_1 & = c                    N_2 & = N_1+N_2-c                     c  & = -N_1.  
For example, if we start with the Coulomb vacuum , ,
then we get , , . This is the
case depicted in figure 4. For producing such an interpolation, we used
 in .
It is convenient to introduce a dimensionless parameter 
. The figures, from  to , show the roots of

as the parameter changes from  to . Other examples from section 3
can be described similarly.

Let us now interpret this in the  theory, where superpotentials of the
form  describe the low energy dynamics.
To construct the  effective superpotential for the gluino bilinears ,
we need the periods of the differential  as well as those of .
We have as in  and eqn. 
S_i&=_A_i R,                   12i F S_i &=
                               _B_i R.  
To evaluate these expressions, we need the transformation laws of the noncompact
cycles .  These are uniquely determined modulo possible addition of a null
vector by the intersections with the compact cycles.  Since the monodromy must
also preserve , it is fixed modulo addition of a common null vector to
 and , and this is irrelevant in the sense that it is equivalent to
a  shift in the theta angle.  So we get
B_1 & = A_1+B_2                  B_2 & = B_2.  
Consequently, the transformation laws are

 S_1 = &
-12i ( F S_1  -
F S_2  ) S_2 = & S_1+S_2 + 12i ( F S_1  -
F S_2  )12i F S_1 &= S_1+12i 
F S_2 12i F S_2 &=12i 
F S_2  
 


Equations Characterizing Components Of Moduli Space 

With the exception of section 3.6, we have discussed so far
examples in which the rank  of the low energy gauge group is
small and the number  of condensed monopoles is
correspondingly large.  Here we will concentrate on examples with
relatively small , and correspondingly a large rank of the low
energy gauge group .

If  is broken classically to , then
.  This implies that if , a typical range
in the following discussion, then some of the  are 1.  This
means that all vacua are Coulomb vacua and confinement is not
relevant in distinguishing different branches.  Nevertheless,
there are different branches of the moduli space of vacua, for a
reason explained in section 2.4.  The different branches
correspond to decompositions , where  and 
are, respectively, the number of double roots of the two
polynomials  and .

Not having confinement as a useful order parameter and with only a
very limited role for discrete symmetries, there appear to be no
conventional order parameters that explain the existence of 
branches labeled by .  Instead, as sketched in the
introduction, we will seek here to characterize each branch by
describing holomorphic functions of chiral operators that have a
vanishing expectation value on a given branch.  The functions with
this property will depend on  and .

Certainly, there is no loss of essential generality in focusing on
the case .  If  or , then the
analysis below does not reveal any unusual equations obeyed on a
given branch.   For each , precisely one of these possibilities
is realized, and  we know of no unusual equations obeyed on this
branch. We will find such equations in all the other cases
s_+s_-+2,  and these relations will depend on
.

To make explicit the double roots, we write
P_N+2^2N  & = H_s_+ ^2
R_N-2s_+                        P_N-2^2N  & = H_s_- ^2
R_N-2s_- .   The curve of the  theory is
y^2=(P_N+2^2N )(P_N-2^2N ) =(H_s_- H_s_+ )^2 R_N-2s_+ R_N-2s_- .  However, in the
matrix model we remove the quadratic factor 
, setting , so
y_m^2=R_N-2s_+ R_N-2s_- .  We write this
y_m^2=R_N-2s_+ (H_s_+ ^2R_N-2s_+ -4^2N )H_s_- ^2 =(H_s_+ R_N-2s_+ H_s_-  )^2(1-4^2N H_s_+ ^2R_N-2s_+   ).  As shown in , the order
parameters  are
t_r=_dxx^r y_m =_dxx^r
 H_s_+ R_N-2s_+ H_s_-  1-4^2N H_s_+ ^2R_N-2s_+   .  Here
the contour is over a large circle near infinity in the complex
-plane (and we recall that a factor of  is included
in the definition of the symbol ). A standard argument
shows that the factor 
 can be replaced by 1 if rs_++s_-2=w-2  as then the terms obtained by expanding the square
root vanish too rapidly at infinity to contribute.  The number of
values of  for which this inequality is obeyed is ;
given our assumption , this is at least .

For  such that  is obeyed, we have simply
t_r =_dxx^r  H_s_+ R_N-2s_+ H_s_-  .  The rational function 
 has poles only at the  zeroes of ,
so it has the form H_s_+ R_N-2s_+ H_s_-  =_i=1 ^s_- b_ix-a_i +polynomial   for
some complex numbers , . Now we evaluate  to
give t_r=_i=1 ^s_-  b_ia_i^r,  valid for 
.

This equation expresses the  quantities , 
, in terms of the  quantities  and
. So the  cannot be independent; they will obey at least
 independent algebraic equations. Before working out
these equations in general, let us consider the first few cases.
If , we have simply , .  If
, we have  for some  and , whence
 whenever  (and ).  The
first such relation (and the only example if  and
) is the equation . We can write this
equation as the vanishing of the determinant of the 
matrix M_2=( t_0 & t_1 t_1 & t_2
 ).  One way to prove that  for  is to
write M_2=(1 & 1 a_1 & a_2  )
( b_1 & 0 0 & b_2 )(1 & a_1
1 & a_2  ),  where we have written a formula for
 that is valid if .  But if we set , we should
take  (and then ) and clearly 
 since the second factor in  has vanishing
determinant.

In general, for any , we set  to be the matrix whose 
matrix element is .  For example, the next case is
M_3=(t_0 & t_1 & t_2 t_1 & t_2 &
t_3 t_2 & t_3 & t_4  ). 
If ,  can be written as a product of three matrices,
namely M_n=A_nB_nA_n^T  with
 A_n=( 1 & 1 & & 1a_1 & a_2 &
 & a_n   a_1^2 & a_2^2 & & a_n^2   & &  &     a_1^n-1 &a_2^n-1  &&a_n ^n-1  ), 
and  a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 
. (Thus, the  matrix element of  is .)
 is a Vandermonde matrix, whose determinant is
_i<j (a_i-a_j).  The determinant of  is
hence M_n=_i<j (a_i-a_j)^2_kb_k  and in
particular is generically nonzero for .

 depends on the  with .  Since our
derivation has assumed that , the maximum value of 
that we should consider is n=[w - 1], 
where for any real ,  denotes  the greatest integer less
than or equal to  . In what follows we set  to this value.
If , the formula  for  remains valid, but we
should set all but  of the  (and ) to zero.  Hence
the matrix , and consequently also , has rank .  It
follows that the rank  minors of  (the determinants of
 matrices obtained by omitting some rows
and columns from ) vanish. These are our relations.

Each minor is a homogeneous polynomial in the  of degree
.  For example, for , the rank  minors are
simply the  themselves, and for , they are the
quadratic functions  (for  ) whose
vanishing we found  earlier for .

Since  is an  matrix, it has minors of all
ranks up to  (the rank  minor being simply ).
The relations we have found are hence non-trivial whenever 
, or equivalently whenver . For , we
have , and the unique relation of this type is 
.

 For any given
, the rank  minors do not generically vanish, since one
of them (the determinant of the upper left 
submatrix of ) is , which is evaluated by
setting  in .  So a branch with given , and
, is characterized by saying that the rank 
minors of  are generically nonvanishing, while the rank
 minors vanish identically. We have accomplished our goal
of finding holomorphic functions of chiral order parameters  whose
vanishing on some branches and not others distinguishes the
different branches, at least modulo the exchange
.

A Generalization to Superpotentials of Arbitrary Degree. 

In section 2.2 we restricted the degree of the superpotential to
be less than . The main reason was that only the first 
coordinates  are independent. In this section we will
generalize the discussion by allowing a superpotential of any
degree. The idea is to regard all 's as independent
coordinates on a larger space subject to constraints.
Classically, a simple way of obtaining the constraints is by
looking at the generating function of ,

 1x-_cl    = _l=0 ^
_cl ^lx^l+1   =
 Nx  + _l=1 ^l u_l x^l+1   .  

Notice that this object is also written in terms of 
 which is a function only of  for 
 as follows,

  1x-  = P'_N(x)P_N(x)  =
ddx P(x).  

Integrating  and  with respect to , we get,

 P(x) = x^N ( - _i=1 ^  u_ix^i ) .  

where the integration constant was fixed by matching the 
terms.

The constraints we are after come from imposing  i.e, the
Laurent series has to terminate at order . Since the
coefficient of  only depends on  with  and
is linear in , imposing that to vanish gives a system of
equations for  with  in triangular form that can
be solved in terms of the first  coordinates.

In writing the effective superpotential  one has to use
 instead of . In
the first section we did not make any distinction since  
 for . For
 the relation receives instanton corrections. This
implies that a modification to the constraints is needed. We now
turn to this issue.

Consider the quantum mechanical analog of ,

1x-  =
 Nx  + _l=1 ^l U_lx^l+1     

where we have denoted  by
.

The full quantum mechanical analog of  is,

1x-  =
P'_N(x)P_N^2(x)-4^2N    =
 ddx ( P_N(x)+P_N^2(x)-4^2N   )  


Integrating with respect to  both  and  we get,

 12 ( P_N(x)+P_N^2(x)-4^2N  
)  =
 x^N ( -_i=1 ^  U_ix^i )  

where the constant of integration was determined to be  by
taking  to zero.

Finally we can find the analog of  by solving for 
in ,

 P_N(x) =  x^N ( -_i=1 ^ 
U_ix^i ) + ^2N x^N   (
_i=1 ^  U_ix^i ).  

Now we are ready to write the generalization of  for a
superpotential of any degree.

  W_eff  = & _r=0 ^k g_r U_r+1  +
V_k-N (x) (   x^N ( -_i=1 ^ 
U_ix^i ) + ^2N x^N   (
_i=1 ^  U_ix^i )  ) dx & +
_i=1 ^N-n  ( L_i(P_N(x)x-p_i 
 dx -2_i ^N )
 +  B_iP_N(x)(x-p_i)^2 dx )    

where  is a polynomial of degree  whose
coefficients are to be thought of as Lagrange multipliers imposing
constraints determining  for  in terms of
 with  and .

The next step is to follow the computations in section 2. The
derivative of  with respect to  is

 g_r + & V_k-N (x)x^r+1   (
 - x^N ( -_i=1 ^  U_ix^i ) +
^2N x^N   ( _i=1 ^  U_ix^i )  ) dx + & Q_N-n-1 (x)H_N-n (x)  P_N(x) U_r+1   dx  = 0  .   

Using  and the fact that in the relevant range of  we
have ,





However, inside the integral we can write 
 for any  since for 
the integral vanishes.

In order to simplify  note that after imposing the
 constraints,




It is easy to see that the  terms do not
contribute to the integrals. Therefore, we can write the integral
in  that contains  as,







Using these results we can multiply  by  and sum over
 from zero to  to get,






Finally, using  we can replace
 by 
in the first integral and  by 
 in the second. As in section 2.2, the 
 does not contribute to the integral. Note that had we
not included instanton corrections in the constraints, we would
have obtained  instead of 
in the first integral and the  could not have
been dropped for .

The final result is thus

  W'(z) = F_2n (x)  ( V_k-N (x)
H_N-n (x) + Q_N-n-1 (x) ) dx(x-z) .  

This agrees with the matrix model equation of motion 
W'(z)=y_m(x)dxx-z   if the matrix model curve is

 where 
. Moreover,
 implies that  is known up to a polynomial
 of degree , i.e.




providing the generalization of  and the result 
discussed in section 2.2.

Let us consider some special cases:

1.  No massless monopoles : Then 
.

2.  Degree of superpotential equal to , i.e. :
. In
particular, for , i.e.  completely broken to ,
 is a constant and 
.


B Proof of the Generalized Konishi
Anomaly from Strong Coupling Analysis. 

In this appendix, using the results from section 2.2 we show that
the generalized Konishi anomaly equation

 W'()z- 
= 2 R(z) 1z- 
 

follows from the effective superpotential .  For simplicity
we will assume that the degree of  is less than  such
that .

Instead of viewing  as the coordinates on the 
Coulomb branch, we can use  and mod out by . This
is valid except at points where some of the eigenvalues of
 coincide. Then, instead of varying  with
respect to  as in , we vary with respect to ,
the eigenvalues of  (recall that
), to get
 W'(_I)=_i=1 ^N-n  L_i P_N(x)  (x-_I)(x-p_i)  dx 
 (We have used the result  from section 2.2.)
 From this we derive that with  outside the contour of
integration
 
 W'(_cl )  z-_cl  =&_I=1 ^N_i=1 ^N-n  L_i P_N(x)  (z-_I) (x-_I)(x-p_i)  dx =&_I=1 ^N_i=1 ^N-n  L_i
 P_N(x) (z-x)(x-p_i)   (1 x-_I  
 -1 z-_I   ) dx=&_i=1 ^N-n  L_i
 P_N(x) (z-x)(x-p_i)   (1 x-_cl   
 -1 z-_cl    ) dx   
Using  , and the
fact that  the first term does not contribute. The
second term can be simplified using  
 W'(_cl ) z-_cl  =  - 1
 z-_cl   _i=1 ^N-n  L_i  P_N(x) (z-x)
 (x-p_i)   dx= - 1
 z-_cl    P_N(x) Q_k-n (x) H_N-n (x) (z-x)  dx
  
where we used manipulations as in . It is important to keep
in mind that we can not replace  by
 as we did in . The reason in that
the terms of order  can not be dropped in the
integral. To see this, note that  for any  inside
the contour of integration. Therefore,  can be expanded
as .

A convenient way to deal with this is to write,





where  is a small contour around . "" and ""
refer to the point  being outside or inside the contour of
integration. The first integral on the rhs gives  as 
indicates. The second one can be evaluated at the pole.

Using  to write,




and  from , we get  to be,

   W'(_cl ) z-_cl  =1
 z-_cl   ( W'(z)  - y_m(z) P_N(z) P^2_N(z)-4^2N    ) 

The left hand side becomes a polynomial in  when combined with
the term proportional to  on the right hand side. The
right hand side can also be simplified by using that 
.  is then,

W'(_cl ) -W'(z)  z-_cl  = y_m(z)
P_N'(z)P^2_N(z)-4^2N    

In the right hand side we use the relation in the chiral ring of





For the left hand side we use the fact that
 

contains only  with  which for  is
equal to ,




Finally, we can write  as follows,

 W'()z-  = 1z-  (W'(z) - y_m(z))
 

By definition, the resolvent of the matrix model  satisfies
. Therefore  becomes the
generalized Konishi anomaly equation,





C Chebyshev polynomials 

In this appendix we list the first six Chebyshev polynomials of
first and second kind. These are used in the examples discussed
in section 3.

The definition given in section 2.3 of Chebyshev polynomials of
the first and second kind of degree  and  respectively is
the following. Set  and let

 T _t(x) =(t)  U _t-1 (x) =1t  dT _tdx (x) = (t)  .  

 From this it is simple to compute the first of then,

 












D A Magnetic Index 

Here we want to explain an interesting result that was obtained
in an unsuccessful attempt to find a new order parameter for
these models.  The attempt was unsuccessful because the object 
 that we defined turned out to be computable in terms of
objects that are already known.

We will examine closely the physical spectrum of particles in a
theory in which classically  is broken to a low energy
subgroup such as  . (Eventually we will
generalize to an arbitrary breaking pattern
.)  Allowing for the strong quantum
dynamics, the true low energy gauge group is .
One  is the center of  and decouples from the
theory.  We will disregard it and focus on the  that is not
decoupled, whose generator we call .

Physical particles in the theory are in general electrically and
magnetically charged with respect to this .  The product of
the smallest nonzero electric charge  (of an unconfined
magnetically neutral particle) times the smallest physical
magnetic charge  is, according to Dirac, an integer . (We
measure  as a multiple of the Dirac quantum .) We
will call this integer the magnetic index, and we claim that
always t=N,  where  is the confinement index
defined in section 2.1.

First let us verify this in examples.  We consider first the case
of  broken to .  We embed  as the
upper left  block in .  For the monopole, we
consider an 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole embedded in  in such
a way that (in a unitary gauge) the magnetic charge is
(0 &   &   &                          & 0 &   &                          &   &  1&                          &    &  & -1  ), 
where in other words the "1" acts in  and the "" in
.  To find the smallest electric charge that is not
confined, we start with the massive -bosons, which are a
 triplet embedded as follows in :
(0 & & & W^1& 0 & & W^2& & 0 &
W^3& & & 0  ).  The components , , and
 have, respectively, electric charges  and , with
respect to the electric charge generator given in .In
evaluating the electric charge of an  singlet, we can
simply use the charge matrix that appears in ;  subtracting
an  generator to get a multiple of  would not change
the result.   The  singlet combination
 is unconfined.  Its electric charge is
.  Since the minimum magnetic charge  in this
theory is 1 (in Dirac units), the product  equals 4.  The
breaking of  to  gives a Coulomb branch,
so , and , as claimed in .

Now we consider the breaking of  to .
 We embed the two factors of  as the upper
left and lower right blocks in , and the monopole charge as
(0 &   &   &                          & 1 &   &                          &   &  -1&                          &    &  & 0  ). 
We focus on the upper right  block of  bosons,
transforming as  of 
: (W^11  & W^12 W^21  &
W^22  ).  The components 
have (with respect to the charge generator in ) respectively
electric charges , and the basic 
singlet

hence has charge .  In the confining branch, with  in
the notation of section 2.1, the confining index is , the
minimum magnetic charge is again , and . So again
, as claimed.

What, however, happens in the branch with classical breaking to
 and with ?  In this case, there is no
confinement, and .  What about ?  Shifting the value of
 changes us from confinement to oblique confinement in one of
the 's, but this does not affect which combinations of 
bosons are confined.  So the minimum electric charge, in the same
units, is still .  However, in section 2.1, we described a
process of magnetic screening that occurs in this model when an
external Wilson loop in the fundamental representation of 
is considered; it is screened by the nucleation of an 't
Hooft-Polyakov monopole with unit charge, and this is the
mechanism that leads to . The fact that the 't
Hooft-Polyakov monopole screens an external Wilson line means
that, in the absence of the Wilson line, it would have infinite
energy and would be confined (we explain the mechanism in more
detail below).  So the minimum unconfined magnetic charge when
 actually has .  Since  is still , this gives
, which, with , is again consistent with .

At least in hindsight, it should not come as too much of a
surprise that we had to consider  here the confinement of certain
magnetic monopoles. We have taken account of electric confinement
to evaluate , so we should expect to consider magnetic
confinement, that is confinement of some magnetic monopoles, to
evaluate .

More directly, the confinement for  of the minimum charge
monopole arises as follows.  The monopole has a collective
coordinate whose quantization leads to the Julia-Zee dyon.  There
is only a single collective coordinate, and quantizing it gives
the monopole  equal color charges in the two
's.Global  charge is not defined in the field
of a magnetic monopole . What we here call the color
electric charge (for a given ) is the quantity that is
well-defined.  It originates from the projection of the charge
generator in  into the  of interest; this charge is
an integer for  generators, and would be a half-integer
for external quarks.  In  gauge theory, ordinary
confinement means that a monopole is unconfined if its color
electric charge is an integer multiple of the  boson color
electric charge, and oblique confinement means that the color
electric charge of an unconfined monopole is a half-integral
multiple of the  boson color electric charge. Setting 
means that one  has ordinary confinement and the other has
oblique confinement. Given this, the states obtained by
quantizing the collective coordinate are all confined, as we have
claimed.

Proof Of The Relation 

Now that we have given an idea of what the relation 
means semiclassically, we proceed to a mathematical proof of this
relation.  In the process, we will also define the index 
for arbitrary rank of the low energy group; above, we assumed
rank 1.

We start with the  Coulomb branch.  The low energy
gauge group (omitting the center of ) is .  The
massive gauge bosons and monopoles have charges that fill out a
rank  lattice that we will call .  On  there is an
integer-valued antisymmetric inner product that we will call
.  For example, if , there is a single  and a
vector in  is specified by giving electric and magnetic charges
. Given two vectors  and , the inner
product is then . In general, for any
number of 's,  is defined by a similar formula,
summing over all of the 's. The Pfaffian of  is in
absolute value Pfaff ()=N.  This relation
reflects the fact that if we incorporate electric charges in the
fundamental representation of , then  would become
unimodular.


Now, after perturbing the theory by a superpotential (or in any
other way, for that matter), some charges may condense.  The
condensed charges generate a sublattice  of .  The
condensed objects are always "mutually local," in the sense that
for , (m,m')=0.  A particle is
confined if its charge vector  is such that 
 for some .  So the charge vectors of unconfined
charges lie in , the sublattice of  consisting of 
such that  for all . Physically, the
charge of an unconfined particle can only be measured modulo ,
since particles with quantum numbers in  have condensed.  So
the measureable charges in the low energy theory take values in
.  The antisymmetric product  induces an
analogous antisymmetric product  for the physical,
unconfined charges in the low energy theory.  The general
definition of  is Pfaff ( determines how many extra types of charge could be added to
the low energy theory (keeping fixed its gauge group) without any
inconsistency.

 is the lattice of charges that are not confined, and hence
the quotient  might be regarded as the lattice of
charges that are confined.  There is a well-defined inner product
; for any , 
, we simply lift  to an element   in an
arbitrary fashion, and define .  The
choice of  is well-defined modulo an element of ;
adding such an element to  does not change .  We
can extend  to an antisymmetric form on  by
defining .  The confinement index
 is .  In fact, the confinement index
measures how many types of charge are conceivable (they have
integer inner products with vectors in ) but are absent in the
theory and can be represented instead by external Wilson loops.

Now it is a fact of linear algebra that in this situation
Pfaff ()= Pfaff (Pfaff (Putting all of this together, we get the
promised relation .

If we are willing to make some unnatural choices, we can define
the lattices and explain the key fact  in a way that might
be easier to follow. There is not any natural way to embed 
as a sublattice of , because vectors in  can only be
interpreted as elements of  modulo . However, this
indeterminacy is unimportant for us; we simply embed  as a
sublattice  by picking a basis of  and lifting
each basis vector to a vector in , making a choice that (for
each basis vector) is unique up to adding an element of . If
we do this, then  can be identified with , the
restriction of  to .

Having identified  as a sublattice of , we can without
further arbitrary choices  define another sublattice
; that is,  consists of elements 
such that  for all .  With respect
to the decomposition ,  is
block-diagonal, _1 & 0 0
& _2 ).  From this,  is clear.
