Abstract 


By performing the matrix integral over the tree level superpotential
of  supersymmetric  gauge theories 
obtained from  SQCD by adding the mass term for the adjoint
scalar field,
the exact effective superpotential in terms of meson field  contains
the nonperturbative ADS superpotential as well as the classical tree
level superpotential. 
By completing the meson matrix integral with the help of saddle point
equation, we find the free energy contributions from matter part
in terms of glueball field, the adjoint field mass and quark mass.
By extremizing the effective superpotential 
with respect to the glueball field,
we analyze the vacuum structure and describe the behavior of
two limiting cases:zero limit of quark mass and  infinity limit of
adjoint field mass.
We also study the magnetic theory. 












Introduction 


A technique for calculating the effective superpotential 
for the glueball
field in an  supersymmetric gauge theory
via a hermitian matrix integral over tree level superpotential was
proposed by Dijkgraaf and Vafa.
Their work is based on mainly the  gauge theory coupled
to adjoint chiral fields with a general superpotential of a polynomial.
There are many related works-along the lines of.
The matrix model calculation with flavors have been found in various 
places

. 
In particular, in the matrix integral
was completely calculated and infinite series in a perturbative expansion
was represented by a single analytic function. Based on this, the 
nonperturbative Affleck-Dine-Seiberg (ADS) superpotential was rederived in 
. On the other hand, there was a different approach to get ADS 
superpotential by including a matrix valued delta funcion, 
which is known as the Wishart integral.
In,
there are some relevant 
works on the  gauge theories in the view point of matrix 
model.    

In this paper,
we calculate the matrix path integral over tree level 
superpotential obtained from
 SQCD by taking into account the 
mass term of adjoint scalar field. The adjoint field
mass  is taken
to be much larger than the dynamical scale  
of the 
theory.  
In the gauge theory side,
one can consistently integrate out the adjoint scalar to obtain
a low-energy effective  superpotential.
This effective theory can be determined exactly using the information
of the low-energy degrees of freedom
of   gauge theories  which was discovered by
Intriligator and Seiberg and  gauge theories by
Intriligator and Pouliot.
By inserting a matrix valued delta function initiated by Demasure and Janik 
 in our problem,
the exact effective superpotential in terms of meson field  possesses
the nonperturbative ADS superpotential 
plus the classical tree
level superpotential. It is rather surprising to see this 
nonperturbative ADS superpotential within the Dijkgraaf-Vafa matrix
model.
   

By completing a  matrix integral over meson field, 
we find the free energy contribution from matter part
in terms of glueball field, the adjoint mass and quark mass.
By extremizing the effective superpotential obtained from
the contributions of free energies, 
with respect to the glueball field,
we analyze the mesonic vacuum structure.
In the gauge theory side, the number of  vacua
and the pattern of flavor symmetry breaking can be determined 
in the limit of zero mass of quark with  and  fixed
while the infinity  limit of
adjoint field mass keeping the quark mass and  the scale of 
 theory fixed corresponds to
the standard  theory without adjoint field.
For  gauge theory with  flavors of quarks in the 
fundamental and anti-fundamental representations,
the exact mesonic vacua in
the matrix descriptions have been found in. 


Matrix model description of supersymmetric  theory  

Let us
consider  an  supersymmetric  gauge theory 
with  flavors of quarks 

 in the vector (fundamental)
representation (). 
The tree level superpotential of the theory is obtained from 
 SQCD
by adding the mass   for the adjoint scalar
 belonging to the  vector
multiplet
W_tree (, Q) = 1 2  Tr   ^2 +
2  Q^i_a _ab  Q^j_b J_ij  + 1 2  m_ij  Q^i_a Q^j_a
where 
  is the symplectic metric 

used to raise and lower 
 flavor indices ( 
 is the  identity matrix )
and  is a quark mass matrix

.
The vacuum structure and phases of resulting 
theories by integrating out the adjoint scalar was found in 
. The  theory (with  
supersymmetry) has a  R-symmetry which
is broken to  by the vev of .
On the other hand, in an 
 theory with , the adjoint
mass explicitly breaks the R-symmetry down to . 

By manipulating this tree level superpotential as 
the potential for the matrix model,
we describe  matrix model at large  by 
replacing the gauge theory fields with matrices to
get the contributions to the free energies. Then the 
partition function can be written as
Z= 1 vol(SO(N))  
[d ] [d Q] 
e^-1 g_s  W_tree (, Q) 
 
where the large -limit behavior of the volume for  gauge group
can be read off from vol(SO(N)) 
 =  -1 4  N^2 ( N 2e^3/2  
) + .
In order to describe and study
the effective theory by the gauge invariant meson fields 
, we make a change of variable in the superpotential
by using a matrix valued delta function defined inwhich is valid for the region  
along the line of 
e^-1 g_s  W_tree (, Q) =
[dM] (M^ij -Q^i Q^j) 
e^-1 g_s  W_tree ( , M) 
where the new superpotential in terms of  
can be written as 
W_tree ( , M) = 
1 2  Tr    ^2 -
1  2  Tr  M J M J + 1 2  Tr  mM, 
 _ab  = _ab  + 2    Q^i_a Q^j_b J_ij .
Now we substitute () into () with matrix path integral
over 
Z  =  1 vol(SO(N))   
[d  ] [d Q] [dM] (M^ij -Q^i Q^j)
e^-1 g_s  W_tree ( , M) .

We make a matrix gaussian integral over   (in the gauge theory
side this is equivalent to the statement that as the mass  is
increased beyond the scale of the asymptotic free  theory
one can integrate out the adjoint field)
and get
Z & = & 1 vol(SO(N))   (
4 g_s   )^N^2/2  
[d Q] [dM] (M^ij -Q^i Q^j)
e^-1 g_s  W_tree ( X) 

where the tree level superpotential depends on the meson fields  only
and
is given by
W_tree (M) = -
1  2  Tr  M J M J + 1 2  Tr  mM.
We execute a matrix integral over  and use the result of Wishart
random matricesZ(S) & = & 1 vol(SO(N))   (
4 g_s   )^N^2/2  e^-1 2  N_f N N 2  
[dM]  ( det  M )^(N-N_f-1)/2 
e^-1 g_s  W_tree (M)  

& & [dM]  Z(S,M).
In the large -limit we are interested in, the glueball 
field  can be identified with  and
the size of  depends on  and the matrix integral over
 does not contribute to the function of .
Let us denote  as the partition function before the integral
over .
Then 
one can write
the log of the partition function as follows:
Z(S,M) 
&=& 1 4  N^2 (8g_s^2 N  e^3/2  ^2 )  
-1 2  N_f 
N ( N 2  ) + N 2  
 det  M  -1 g_s  W_tree (M) + 

& = &  S^2 4g_s^2  
( 8g_s S  e^3/2  ^2  )  -S N_f 2g_s   
( S 2g_s  ) + S 2g_s  
 det  M
 -1 g_s  W_tree (M) + 

& & -1 g_s^2  F _2 -1 g_s  F _1.
Then
the effective superpotential  for the glueball field  by 
identifying the  and  terms can be 
computed as the derivative of the contribution to free energy 
 plus 
the contribution  from flavors
W  & = &
(N_c-2) F _2 S  + F _1


& = & 1 2  (N_c-2 ) 
[ S - S ( S  ^3  ) ]  -
S N_f 2   ( 1- S ) -
S 2  det   M   + W_tree (M).
Solving the F-flatness condition  
(minimizing  with respect to a glueball field )
one gets
S  = ( ^3(N_c-2)   det  M   
)^1/(N_c-N_f-2)  
e^2i k/(N_c-N_f-2) ,  
k=1, , (N_c-N_f-2)
with the phase factor 
reflecting the  supersymmetric vacua. 
Then the exact superpotential  by plugging back 
 
into () leads to
W(M) & = &
1 2  (N_c-N_f-2 ) S     + W_tree (M) 

& = &  1 2  (N_c  -N_f-2 ) _N_c-N_f-2  ( 
 ^3(N_c-2)   det   M  
)^1/(N_c-N_f-2)  + W_tree (M) 

&= &   1 2  (N_c -N_f -2 ) _N_c-N_f-2  ( 
16 _N_c,N_f ^3(N_c-2)-N_f  det  
M  )^1/(N_c-N_f-2)  + 
W_tree (M) 

& =& W_ADS (M)+W_tree (M)
where

 is the strong coupling
scale of the  theory obtained by decoupling
the adjoint field   and 
 is the -th root of
unity.
We have checked that the nonperturbative ADS superpotential
 was obtained from the large  asymptotics of 
the constrained matrix integral measure 
in the context of Dijkgraaf-Vafa matrix
model.
In the low energy effective theory, the classical vacuum degeneracy was 
lifted by quantum effects which is represented by a dynamically 
generated superpotential for the light meson fields . 
The superpotential alone generated by gaugino condensation 
has no vacuum but by adding the 
to the superpotential ,  
the theory has  supersymmetric vacua.
If not all of the matter fields are massive, in the gauge theory side,
one can integrate  out massive quarks and get the effective superpotential
at low energy for the massless ones. 
It is the same form as the above  but with the scale replaced by
the low energy one.


In order to perform the matrix integral over  in (), 
the evaluation of this matrix integral is 
approximated around the solution of the saddle point equation 
(for  matrix model this approach was done in) 
-1   _i + 1 2  m_i - S _i  =0 
where the matrix  has the following form
 and 
.
In the gauge theory side, this can be obtained by differentiating 
() with respect to the meson fields  and looking at
the equations of motion for the .
This has two solutions for each  as a function of
 denoted by 
_i ^()  = m_i ( 1 1-16 _i S   4 )
m_i f^() (_i S), _i =1 m_i^2 .
Let us remind that 's are the component of a quark mass matrix  

.
By using the solution () at the  saddle point and eliminating 
the quadratic part of meson field of the effective superpotential, 
one can read off the free energy in terms of glueball field ,
a quark mass  and the adjoint field mass  from the matter part
as follows:
F _1(S, _i) = -S _i=1 ^n_f  (1 2 -
1 4 f^() (_i S)  -f^() (_i S)  )
where we also used the fact that the product of two roots of 
behaves like 
_i^(+)  _i^(-)  =S.
It is ready to write the effective superpotential from 
the complete matrix integration 
and the free energy due to the matter part above in terms of guleball 
field :
W(S,,m_i,) = S [ 1 2  (N_c-2 ) ( 
 1 -  S  ^3 
)-
_i=1 ^n_f  (1 2 -
1 4 f^() (_i S)  -f^() (_i S)  ) ].
By differentiating this with respect to  and using the explicit expression
for  in () we get
( S ^3  )^N_c-2 2   & = &
_i=1 ^n_f   f^() (_i S)  


& = & 1 2^2n_f   
_i=1 ^r ( 1 + 1-16 _i S  )
_i'=r+1 ^n_f  ( 1 - 1-16 _i S  )
where the index  runs for the positive sign among the roots
of  and the index 
does for the negative sign respectively. 
Here we used 
.
This relation () 
is exactly the same as the defining equation of  in the
notation of.
Although one cannot solve exactly, one determines
the number of distinct solutions (or the number of distinct vacua)
and symmetry breaking patterns in certain limiting regimes. 
In the  limit (),
one can ignore the second term in () and from 
() one gets
_i = ^()  -S , S^N_c-n_f-2  ( _N=2 ^2 )^N_c-n_f-2 .
Here the strong coupling scale of the  theory is related to
the dynamical  scale   by one loop matching
condition through
^N_c-2  _N=2 ^2(N_c-2-n_f)  = _N_c,N_f ^3(N_c-2)-N_f .

Then there exist  distinct solutions 
(that is, the expression of () is a polynomial
of degree  in  and the number of ways for choosing
 positive signature is given by ) 
and the total number of  vacua is 
given by
 = (N_c-n_f-2) _r=0 ^n_f  ( n_f r  ) =
 ( N_c-n_f-2) 2^n_f 
which coincides with the number of the semi-classical vacua 
. The quantum
corrected effective action shows a spontaneous breakdown of the global
 symmetry into  since
some of the meson vevs remain non-zero in this limit.
The proof for this was given in.
When the quark masses are nonvanishing, 
the unbroken flavor symmetry 
is  which agrees with the classical description.

The solutions of the full nonlinear coupled equations 
() and () can be classified according to
the number of 's.
For large quark masses () assuming that
,  
the multiplicity of solutions gives
 and  there are  ways of selecting
a vacuum configuration with  nonzero  and
the number of vacua with   symmetry
is  which is the same as the 
semi-classical results.  
In particular,  vacuum will lead to 
S^N_c-2  ^N_c-2  ^2(N_c-n_f-2) _N=2  det  m  _N_c,N_f ^3(N_c-2)-N_f  det  m
which was observed in in the description of 
Dijkgraaf-Vafa matrix model.

As the number of flavors is increased,
in the IR theory of electric theory, the magnetic theory
is described by an  gauge theory
() 
with  flavors of dual quarks 

 and the additional
gauge singlet fields  which is an elementary field of dimension 1
at the UV-fixed point.
The matter field variables in the magnetic theory
are the original electric variables  and magnetic quarks
 with the superpotential together with mass term
W = 1 2   M^ij  q_i q_j + W_tree (M)
where  is given in ().
The partition function can be written 
as follows:
Z & = & 1 vol(SO(N ))   
 [d q]  [dM] e^-1 g_s  (   
 1  2   M^ij  q_i q_j +
W_tree (M) ) . 
After calculating a gaussian matrix integral over , 
the effective superpotential from the
log of partition function
can be expressed as by using the method in in dual gauge
theory 
W(M) & = & 1 2  (N _c-2 ) 
( S - S S  
  ^3  )   
-
S N_f 2     + 1 2  S 
det  ( M   ) +W_tree (M) 


& = &  1 2  (N _c-2 ) 
( S-  S S  
(  ^3(N _c-2)-
N_f  det   ( M   ) )^1/
(N _c-2)   ) + W_tree (M). 
Solving the F-flatness condition 
one gets, with the phase factor 


reflecting the  supersymmetric vacua,
S =( 2^12   ^3(N _c-2)-
N_f _N_f-N_c+4,N_f  det  ( M   ) 
 )^1/(N _c-2)  _
N _c-2 ,  ^3(N _c-2)-
N_f 
= 2^12   ^3(N _c-2)-
N_f _N_f-N_c+4,N_f .
Then the exact superpotential by plugging this  into 
() leads to
W & = & 
1 2  (N _c-2 ) S  +W_tree (M)


& = & 1 2  (N _c  -2 ) _
N _c-2  ( 
 2^12   _N_f-N_c+4,N_f ^
3(N _c-2)-N_f  det  M  
 ^N_f   )^1/(N _c-2) +W_tree (M)


& = & 1 2  (-N_c +N_f+ 2 )
_-N_c+N_f+2 
( 
 2^12   _N_f-N_c+4,N_f ^3(N_f-N_c+2)-N_f 
det  M 
 ^N_f   )^1/(-N_c+N_f+2) +W_tree (M)


& = & 
 1 2  (N_c -N_f -2 ) _N_c-N_f-2  ( 
16  _N_c,N_f ^3(N_c-2)-N_f  det  M   )^
1/(N_c-N_f-2) +W_tree (M)


& = & 
W_ADS (M)+W_tree (M)
which is exactly the same as the one in (). 
Here we used the fact that 
 and

.
The scale of the magnetic theory in the gauge theory side was 
related to that of 
electric theory by2^8 _N_c,N_f ^3(N_c-2)-N_f  
 _N_f-N_c+4,N_f ^3(N_f-N_c+2)-N_f  = 
(-1)^N_f-N_c  
^N_f 
where the normalization factor  was chosen to get
the consistent low energy behavior under large mass deformation and along the 
flat directions.
Note that the factor  
in () is cancelled exactly
by the overall  factor.


Matrix model description of supersymmetric  theory  


In this section, we continue to study the matrix model  
for the symplectic group .
Let us
consider  an  supersymmetric  gauge theory 
with  flavors of quarks 

 in the fundamental
representation (). 
The tree level superpotential of the theory is obtained from 
 SQCD
by adding the mass   for the adjoint scalar
 belonging to the  vector
multiplet 
W_tree (, Q) =  Tr   ^2 +
1 2   Q^i_a ^a_b Q^i_c J^bc  + 1 2  m_ij  Q^i_a 
Q^j_b J^ab 
where 
  is the symplectic metric 

and  is a quark mass matrix

.
The vacuum structure and phase and flavor symmetry breaking pattern
of this  theory was studied in. 

By manipulating this tree level superpotential as 
the potential for the matrix model,
we describe  matrix model at large  by 
replacing the gauge theory fields with corresponding matrices to
get the contributions to the free energies. Then the 
partition function can be written as
Z= 1 vol(Sp(N))  
[d ] [d Q] 
e^-1 g_s  W_tree (, Q) 
 
where the large -limit behavior of the volume for  gauge group   
can be read off from vol(Sp(N)) 
 =  -1 4  N^2 ( N 2e^3/2   ) + .
In order to describe the effective theory by the meson fields 
 which is 
antisymmetric, 
we make a change of variable in the superpotential
by using a matrix valued delta function 
e^-1 g_s  W_tree (, Q) =
[dM] (M^ij -Q^i Q^j) 
e^-1 g_s  W_tree ( , M) 
where the new superpotential in terms of   
can be written as 
W_tree ( , M) = 
Tr    ^2 -
1  8  Tr  M J M J - 1 2  Tr  mM, 
 ^a_b = ^a_b + 1 22    J^ac  Q^i_c Q^i_b.
Now we substitute () into () with matrix path integral
over 
Z  =  1 vol(Sp(N))   
[d  ] [d Q] [dM] (M^ij -Q^i Q^j)
e^-1 g_s  W_tree ( , M) .

We make a matrix gaussian integral over  
Z & = & 1 vol(Sp(N))   (
2g_s   )^N^2/2  
[d Q] [dM] (M^ij -Q^i Q^j)
e^-1 g_s  W_tree (M) 

where the tree level superpotential depends on the meson fields  and
is given by
W_tree (M) = -
1  8  Tr  M J M J - 1 2  Tr  mM.
We execute a matrix integral over  and use the result of Wishart
random matricesZ(S) & = & 1 vol(Sp(N))   (
2g_s   )^N^2/2  e^-1 2  N_f N N 2  
[dM]  ( det  M )^(N-N_f-1)/2 
e^-1 g_s  W_tree (M) 
 

& & [dM]  Z(S,M).
In the large -limit we are interested in, the glueball 
field  can be identified with  and
the size of  depends on  and the matrix integral over
 does not contribute to the function of .
Let us put  as the partition function before the integral
over .
Then 
one can write
the log of the partition function as follows:
Z(S,M) 
&=&   1 4  N^2 (8g_s^2 N  e^3/2  ^2 ) 
 -1 2  N_f 
N ( N 2  ) + N 2  
 det  M  -1 g_s  W_tree (M) + 

& = &  S^2 4g_s^2  
( 8g_s S  e^3/2  ^2  )  -S N_f 2g_s   
( S 2g_s  ) + S 2g_s  
 det  M
 -1 g_s  W_tree (M) + 

& & -1 g_s^2  F _2 -1 g_s  F _1.
Then
the effective superpotential  for the glueball field  can be 
computed as the derivative of the contribution to free energy 
 plus 
the contribution from flavors
W  & = &
(N_c+2) F _2 S  + F _1


& = & 1 2  (N_c+2 ) 
[ S - S ( S  ^3  ) ]  -
S N_f 2   ( 1- S ) -
S 2  det   M   + W_tree (M).
Solving the F-flatness condition  
(minimizing  with respect to a glueball field )
one gets
S  = ( ^3(n_c+1)   Pf  M   
)^1/(n_c-n_f+1)  
e^2i k/(n_c-n_f+1) ,  
k=1, , (n_c-n_f+1)
with the phase factor 
reflecting the  supersymmetric vacua. 
Here  is the Pfaffian of the antisymmetric matrix . 
Then the exact superpotential by plugging  into () leads to
W(M) & = &   1 2  (N_c-N_f+2 ) S  + 
W_tree (M) 

& =& (n_c  -n_f+1 ) _n_c-n_f+1  ( 
^3(n_c+1)   Pf   M  
)^1/(n_c-n_f+1)  + W_tree (M) 


&= &   (n_c -n_f +1 ) _n_c-n_f+1  ( 
2^n_c-1  _n_c,n_f ^3(n_c+1)-n_f  Pf  
M  )^1/(n_c-n_f+1)  + 
W_tree (M) 


& =& W_ADS (M)+W_tree (M)
where

.
The classical vacuum degeneracy was 
lifted by quantum effects which is represented by a dynamically 
generated superpotential for the light meson fields . 
The superpotential generated by gaugino condensation 
has no vacuum but by adding the ()
to the superpotential ,  
the theory has  supersymmetric vacua.

In order to perform the matrix integral over , it is 
approximated around the solution of the saddle point equation 
(for  matrix model this approach was done in) 
1 2  _i -  m_i - S _i  =0 
where the matrix  has the following form

.
This has two solutions for each 
_i ^()  = m_i ( 1 1+2 _i S  )
m_i f^() (_i S), _i =1 m_i^2 .
By using the solution () at the  saddle point and eliminating 
the quadratic part of meson field of the effective superpotential, 
together with the fact that
_i^(+)  _i^(-)  =-2S,
one gets the free energy in terms of glueball field, quark mass and
adjoint field mass from the matter part
F _1(S, _i) = -S _i=1 ^n_f  (1 2 -
1  f^() (_i S)  -f^() (_i S)  ).
The effective superpotential from 
the complete matrix integration 
and the free energy due to the matter part above in terms of glueball 
field  is
W(S,,m_i,) = S [ 1 2  (N_c+2 ) ( 
 1 -  S  ^3 
)-
_i=1 ^n_f  (1 2 -
1  f^() (_i S)  -f^() (_i S)  ) ].
By differentiating this with respect to  we get
( S ^3  )^n_c+1  & = &
_i=1 ^n_f   f^() (_i S)  


& = &

_i=1 ^r ( 1 - 1+2 _i S  )
_i'=r+1 ^n_f  ( 1 + 1+2 _i S  )
where we choose 
 negative signs and  positive signs in the roots of 
.
Here we used 

obtained from () easily.
As in the case of previous section, this relation corresponds to
the defining equation of  in.
The distinct vacua can be determined in certain limiting regimes.
In the massless quark limit () 
with fixed  and , 
there are  solutions for  by ignoring
the second term in () and 
there is  possibilities for the signs among 's
_i = ^()  2 S , S^2n_c-n_f+2  ( _N=2 ^2 )^2n_c-n_f+2 .
where 
the strong coupling scale of the  theory is related to
the dynamical  scale   through
^2n_c+2  _N=2 ^2(2n_c+2-n_f)  = 
_n_c,n_f ^2(3(n_c+1)-n_f) .


Moreover, for a particular phase of  with even or odd solutions, 
the number of 
minus signs among  must be even or odd, respectively. 
This will reduce to the choice of the signs by half 
. 
Therefore there exists 
 ( 2n_c-n_f+2) 2^n_f-1 
vacua which is consistent with the semi-classical result. 

For  limit which is different from previous 
limit,  some of the 's of () are of order of
 while others are much smaller. For large 's there 
exists the relation  and the smaller 's
can be found by substituting the large 's into the defining
equation (). 
According to the analysis of 
, the total number of the vacua agrees with 
the one of the classical vacua.    
We can see the standard supersymmetric vacua of the theories 
without adjoint field corresponding to  vacua
S^n_c+1  ^n_c+1  ^2(n_c+1)-n_f _N=2  Pf  m
_n_c,n_f ^3(n_c+1)-n_f  Pf  m  
which can be interpreted similarly as the one in.
For , it is evident that ADS superpotential vanishes
and the classical moduli space of vacua is changed quantum mechanically.
The large  theory develops a quantum modified
constraintPf  M = 2^n_c-1  _n_c,n_c+1 ^2(n_c+1) .

By introducing a Lagrange multiplier 
in order to impose this constaint
the effective  superpotential will be 
W = Y ( Pf  M - 2^n_c-1  _n_c,n_c+1 ^2(n_c+1) 
) + W_tree (M).

One can check that the total number of vacua will be consistent with
the semi-classical result.
When , the large  theory develops a superpotential
W = -Pf  M 
 2^n_c-1  _n_c,n_c+2 ^2(n_c+1)  
 + W_tree (M).


In the IR theory of electric theory, the magnetic theory
is described by an  gauge theory
() 
with  flavors of dual quarks 

 and the additional
gauge singlet fields  which is an elementary field of dimension 1
at the UV-fixed point.
The matter field variables in the magnetic theory
are the original electric variables  and magnetic quarks
 with the superpotential together with mass term
W = 1    M^ij  q_i q_j + W_tree (M).
where the scale  is the matching scale between the electric
and magnetic gauge couplings and  is given in
().  
The partition function can be written 
as follows:
Z & = & 1 vol(Sp(N ))   
 [d q]  [dM] e^-1 g_s  (   
 1     M^ij  q_i q_j +
W_tree (M) ) . 
The effective superpotential from the
log of partition function
after calculating a gaussian matrix integral over  
can be expressed as
W & = & 1 2  (N _c+2 ) 
( S - S S  
  ^3  )   
-
S N_f 2     + 1 2  S 
det  ( 2M   ) +W_tree (M) 


& = &  1 2  (N _c+2 ) 
( S-  S S  
(  ^3(N _c+2)-
N_f  det   ( 2M   ) )^1/
(N _c+2)   )+W_tree (M) 


& = &   (n _c+1 ) 
( S-  S S  
(  ^3(n _c+1)-
n_f  Pf   ( 2M   ) )^1/
(n _c+1)   ) + W_tree (M) 
where .
Solving the F-flatness condition 
one gets, with the phase factor 


reflecting the  supersymmetric vacua,
S =( 2^n _c-1  
 ^3(n _c+1)-
n_f _n_f-n_c-2,n_f  Pf   ( 2M  
) 
 )^1/(n _c+1)  _
n _c+1 ,  ^3(n _c+1)-
n_f 
= 2^n _c-1  
 ^3(n _c+1)-
n_f _n_f-n_c-2,n_f .
Then the exact superpotential by plugging 
this  into () leads to
W & = &  
1 2  (N _c+2 ) S 
+ W_tree (M)


& = & (n _c  +1 ) _
n _c+1  ( 
 2^n _c-1+n_f   _n_f-n_c-2,n_f ^
3(n _c+1)-n_f   Pf  M  
 ^n_f   )^1/(n _c+1) +W_tree (M)

 
& = &  (-n_c +n_f-1 )
_-n_c+n_f-1 
( 
 2^-n_c+2n_f-3  
 _n_f-n_c-2,n_f ^3(n_f-n_c-1)-n_f 
Pf  M 
 ^n_f   )^1/(-n_c+n_f-1) +W_tree (M)


& = & 
  (n_c +1-n_f  ) _n_c+1-n_f  ( 
2^n_c-1   _n_c,n_f ^3(n_c+1)-n_f  
Pf  M   )^
1/(n_c+1-n_f) +W_tree (M)


& = & 
W_ADS (M)+W_tree (M)
which is exactly the same as the one in (). 
Here we used the fact that 
 and

.
This suggests Seiberg duality in the context of matrix model.
The scale of the magnetic theory in the gauge theory side was 
related to that of 
electric theory by _n_c,n_f ^3(n_c+1)-n_f  
 _n_f-n_c-2,n_f ^3(n_f-n_c-1)-n_f  = 
2^4-2n_f  (-1)^n_f-n_c-1  
^n_f 
where the normalization factor  was chosen to get
the consistent low energy behavior under large mass deformation and along the 
flat directions. Note that we take different convention for mass term and that 
is the reason why there exists  factor in the above ().   
Of course, the number of vacua can be also obtained from 
the vacuum  equation in the magnetic theory like as the electric theory.
By making the ansatz 


, we get similar vacuum equation. In the massless limit,
the solution for  will provide 
X^2n_c+2-n_f  =  ^-2(3(n_f-n_c-1)-n_f)  ^2n_f  
^-n_f 
and together with  possibilities coming from the sign choices
for each , it will be the same number as 
as we have seen before.
