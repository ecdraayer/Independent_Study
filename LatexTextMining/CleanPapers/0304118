A path integral formula for
the associative star-product of two superfields is proposed. 
It is a generalization of the Kontsevich-Cattaneo-Felder's formula for
the star-product of functions of bosonic coordinates. 
The associativity of the star-product imposes certain conditions on the background of  our sigma model.
 For generic background the 
action is not supersymmetric. The supersymmetry invariance of
the action constrains the background and leads to a simple formula
for the star-product. 





Introduction 


An outstanding problem is the following:  Given a classical structure find its quantum extension(s) . Deformation quantization theory is an interesting 
approach to this problem. 

In it was shown that any symplectic manifold can be deformation-quantized.
The question whether any Poisson manifold can be quantized was 
answered in affirmative only recently by Kontsevich. The solution presented
by Kontsevich uses in a essential way ideas of perturbative string theory.
Kontsevich's construction was further clarified by Cattaneo and Felder  in, where an explicit
path integral
formula for the star-product
of functions on  the Poisson manifolds was given. 

Unlike the star-product on the Grassmann-even manifolds, the star-product on the supermanifolds is not sufficiently studied. For a list of
papers on the subject, see. 
Ref. gives a systematic analysis of 
the deformation of the algebra of four dimensional supercoordinates.(
For an earlier discussion of the quantum deformations of the Poincare supergroup, see
.)  
The most general deformed ,  supercoordinate algebra which satisfies Jacobi identities and is compatible with the 
 supersymmetry reads
[x^i,x^j] = i  ^ij (),     [x^i,^ ] = i  ^i ,      ^ ,^  = 0,
susyalg 
where  is -independent and is a linear function of .  is independent of  and , and satisfies
an equation following from the Jacobi identity.

Recently, using Berkovits' covariant formalism for quantizing type II superstring compactified on a Calabi-Yau
three-fold, Ooguri and Vafa made an interesting observation that the RR field strengths can give
rise to a non-zero  anticommutator  in four dimensions.(For an earlier
discussion of RR backgrounds in the context of noncommutativity in string theory, see.)   
De Boer, Grassi and van Nieuwenhuizen generalized this observation to ten dimensional superspace using the
covariant formalism. Ref. also pointed out that the gravitino 
yields a non-zero value for .

The purpose of this paper is to give a general path integral formula for the star-product of functions of  and .
The -algebra which arises from our path integral formula is of the form 



[x^i,^ ]_  = i  ^i (x,)+O(^2),      
 ^ ,^ _  = i  ^ (x,) + O(^2).
susyalgmod 
Using path integral methods, we will derive  the associativity equations satisfied by the fields ,  and .

As a main tool in deriving the path integral formula, we use an elegant supermanifold
formalism for the Batalin-Vilkovisky(BV) quantizationintroduced by  Alexandrov, Kontsevich, Schwarz and Zaboronsky. This formalism was
 further elaborated and extended by Park.(
See also.) 
The AKSZ method is a method
to construct solutions of the BV master equation directly, without starting from a classical action with a 
set of symmetries, as is done in the BV method. The classical action is then recovered a posteriori  by
setting the fields of non-zero ghost number to zero. In ten spacetime dimensions
 the classical action that we obtain from our BV-action
using this method will turn out to be equivalent, for the constant background fields, to the one used in 
.

The star-product will be
represented as a path integral of a sigma model on a superdisk.
 The BV-action 
of the sigma model will be  a functional of  the superspace-valued
superfields. The action  depends on the background fields ,  and . Imposing 
the supersymmetry invariance of the action, we will obtain the algebra (). We will also find
an explicit formula for the supersymmetric star-product of functions of  and .

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2  the path integral formula is given, the associativity
equations are derived and the Feynman diagrammatics is presented. The supersymmetric backgrounds
are considered in section 3 where an explicit expression for the star-product is given. A summary of our results
 can be found in section 4.

Path integral formula  
The star-product is
represented as a path integral on a superdisk with the two functions inserted on the boundary of
the disk: 



 _X()=x, ()=  f(X(0),(0)) g(X(1),(1))  ^ i  S[   ,  ,  ,  ]   DDDD_Lagrangian submanifold   
formula 
where  and  are the points on the boundary of the disk where the functions are inserted. The path
integral is computed with the condition ,  at the point  of the boundary of the
disk. The path integral is taken over a Lagrangian submanifold in the field space .



We first describe the fields that appear in  formula .
, ,  and  are maps from the superdisk to a superspace .
The local coordinates of  are  and . For simplicity we work in the spacetime dimension  that admits a Majorana representation.  is a Majorana spinor in  dimensions.
  is a spacetime index
and  is a spinorial index. 
The coordinates of 
are  graded with respect to two Grassmann gradations  and :
&&_1 (X) = 0,      _1 ()=1,      _1()=0,      _1()=1, &&_2 (X) = 0,      _2 ()=0,      _2()=1,      _2()=1.
parity 
The commutation property of functions on  is given by the relation 
f g = (-1)^_1(f)_1(g)+_2(f)_2(g)  g f .
Let   and  () be bosonic and fermionic coordinates of the
superdisk.
Then
= (,),   = (,),   =(,),   = (,).
In other words  we have an embedding  of the superdisk   into the superspace :
: D M .
embed 
We now describe the action  in formula . It is an integral over the superdisk  
S= S_0 + S_int    = _D  d^2d^2 (_0 +) =  _D  d^2d^2 Laction 
of the Lagrangian density
L&=& _0 + ,  _0 &=& _i D^i + _  D^ , &=& 12  ^i j (,) _i _j  + 12  ^ (,)_  _ +
^i (,) _ _i  .
Lagrangian 
 in Lagrangian  is defined as
D= ^  ^  .
The action  is a Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) action. The components of the superfields 
, ,  and  in the expansion in ,
&=& ^(0)   +  ^(1) _ ^   +  ^(2) _  ^ ^ , &=& ^(0)   +  ^(1) _ ^   +  ^(2) _  ^ ^ ,
&=& ^(0)   +  ^(1) _ ^   +  ^(2) _  ^ ^ , &=& X^(0)   +  X^(1) _ ^   +  X^(2) _  ^ ^ , 
compon 
can be identified with the 
fields and antifields in the BV quantization of a classical action . The latter can be obtained from 
action  setting to zero fields with non-zero ghost number.
The ghost numbers of the component fields in compon  can be computed by assigning ghost number one
to  and taking overall ghost number of the superfield to be given by the parity  defined
in parity . Thus we find
(X^(k) ) =  -k,  (^(k) )= -k,  (^(k) )=1-k,  (^(k) )=1-k,    k=0,1,2.
Note that  is the most general ghost number  two interaction term that can be constructed out of
, ,  and .
Setting to zero fields with a non-zero ghost number in action , we find
 S_cl &=& [^(1) _i dX^(0)i  + ^(0) _  d^(0) +
12  ^i j (X^(0) ,^(0) ) ^(1) _i ^(1) _j &&         + 12  ^ (X^(0) ,^(0) )^(1) _  ^(1) _ +
^i (X^(0) ,^(0) ) ^(1) _ ^(1) _i   ],
where 
^(1) _i = ^(1) _i d^ ,     ^(1) _  = ^(1) _ d^ 
are one forms.(Integrating out  in , we end up with an action which is, for
constant background fields,
equivalent to the action (without the  term) used in. To be more precise, the two actions are
equivalent modulo the difference in the type of spinors considered: we have type IIA spinors whereas ref.used type IIB.)  

In the BV quantization the action  must satisfy the master equation:
(S,S)_BV    - 2 iS = 0,
where  is the BV-bracket and  is the BV-Laplacian. 
It can be checked that 
S = 0.
Thus the master equation becomes
(S,S)_BV     = 0.  
SS 
The associativity of the star-product follows from
the Ward identity as in. Thus SS  implies the associativity of the star-product:
(S,S)_BV     = 0                  the star-product is associative  . 


We decompose the action  into the kinetic  and the interaction  parts as in action .
 It is easy to show that (see):
(S_0,)_ =D,   (S_0,)_ =D,   (S_0,)_ =D,   (S_0,)_ =D.
Thus we have
(S_0,S_ )_ =_D  D .
Since the integrand on the r.h.s. of this equation is a total derivative, the integral can be reduced to
 an integral over the boundary of the disk.
 This boundary integral vanishes due to the boundary conditions for the superfields:
&&X^(1) _  n^  = 0,   X^(2) _  = 0,   ^(0)  = 0,   ^(1) _  t^ =0, &&^(1) _  n^  = 0,   ^(2) _  = 0,   ^(0)  = 0,   ^(1) _  t^ =0, 
where  and  are normal and tangential vectors to the boundary of the disk.(
The components  and  satisfy the conditions: 

 and 
.) 
Thus we have . Similarly, we can show that
.
Thus SS  reduces to
 (S_ ,S_ )_ =0.
sint 
sint 
implies that 
the background fields ,  and  satisfy certain equations. We now derive these
 equations. 
The calculations can be significantly simplified if we use the following formula 
 which relates the BV-bracket
to a bracket  on the superspace :
_D ^* [f,g] = _D  ^* f, _D ^* g _BV   . 
parkid 
Here  and  are pullbacks of the functions  and  on  to the
superdisk  with respect to the map  from embed .
The bracket   is given by
[f,g] = _r f_i  gX^i  -  fX^i _l g_i +_r f_   _l g^   + _r f^   _l g_  .
bracket 
where  and  denote the right and the left partial derivatives.(bracket  follows from
a general formula for the (odd) Poisson bracket on the supermanifold . Let  be the local coordinates of  and let
 be an odd non-degenerate closed 2-form on . In our case it is
given by . 
The Poisson bracket is given by
,
where
  is the inverse matrix of .
) 
Using parkid , sint   is equivalent to
[, ] = 0,  
HH 
where  is a function on :
H = 12  ^i j (X,) _i _j  + 12  ^ (X,)_  _ +
^i (X,) _ _i .
Hfunction 
Since , we have
[,]= 2 _r _i  X^i  + _  _l^  .
HH1 
From the equations (), () and HH1  we find
(^i  _  ^j k + ^il _l ^jk )    _i _j _k &=& 0, (^  _  ^ + ^i _i ^ )  _ _ _  &=& 0, ( ^ _ ^i j  - 2 ^i _  ^j -2^ik _k ^j +^k _k ^ij )  _  _i _j &=& 0, (2 ^  _  ^k  - ^k _  ^ +2 ^i _i ^k - ^k j _j ^ )   _ _  _k &=& 0, 
master 
where  and . master  is a generalization
of the familiar Jacobi identity for the Poisson bivector :
B^il _l B^jk + B^jl _l B^ki +B^kl _l B^ij =0.
We now explain the last ingredient of the formula (): the integration over a Lagrangian submanifold
in the field space . A final step in the BV quantization procedure involves choosing a ghost number  function ,
the "gauge fixing fermion", of the fields. The path integral is then taken over
the Lagrangian submanifold defined by the equations:
antifield =field   
We refer the reader to ref. for the details on how new fields, called antighosts and Lagrange multipliers
together with their antifields, are added to the set of fields  and . In a very similar way, we can add
antighosts and Lagrange multipliers
together with their antifields to  and . This procedure results in the following operational formula  for  the star-product:
&&fg (x,) = f(x+(0,0),+(0,0))&&      ^i S_  [ x+  ,+  ,  ,  ] g(x+(1,0),+(1,0)),
formula2 
where  is given by action  and Lagrangian .(The tadpole diagrams
in formula2  are discarded. This can be achieved by the introduction of terms linear in  and  in
the action: , ,  and .)  
The Wick-contraction  in formula2  is done using the super-propagators:
^k(z_1,_1) _j(z_2,_2) &=& i 2  ^k_j  (z_2,z_1),^ (z_1,_1) _j(z_2,_2) &=& i 2  ^k_j  (z_2,z_1),
propag 
where
(z,w)= 12 i  ln  (z-w)(z-w )(z -w )(z -w) 
and
= _1^ z_1^   + _2^  z_2^  .
Note that points  and  from propag  belong to the upper-half complex plane. 
A generic term in the perturbative expansion in formula2  is of the form
&&dz_j  d_j dz^ _j  d^ _j   (z_1 ,_1 )(z_N ,_N )  (z_N+1 ,_N+1 )(z_2N ,_2N ) &&                  (z^ _1 ,^ _1 )(z^ _M ,^ _M )  (z^ _M+1 ,^ _M+1 )(z^ _2M ,^ _2M )
perturb 

times an expression involving  partial derivatives of , , ,  and .
Wick-contracting using propag  and integrating over the Grassmann variables 's in perturb , we
end up with a sum of expressions of the form
d(z_i_1 ,z_j_1 ) d(z_i_2 ,z_j_2 ) d(z_i_N ,z_j_N ) d(z^ _i_1 ,z^ _j_1 ) d(z^ _i_2 ,z^ _j_2 ) 
d(z^ _i_M ,z^ _j_M ) 
where  is defined as
d(z,w) = dz z (z,w)+dw w (z,w).
A special case: supersymmetric backgrounds 
The kinetic part  of the action () is invariant under the following supersymmetry
transformation:
^  &=& ^ , ^k &=& i   ^k , _   &=& - i _k   ^  ^k_ , _k &=&  0.  
susy 
Since  is a Majorana spinor, the  transformation () is an  or  supersymmetry
transformation  depending 
on the dimension  of the spacetime. For  it is  and for  it is
.
Imposing the invariance of the full action ()  under the transformation (), we find that
the background fields are further constrained. We will shortly show that the associativity and 
supersymmetry constrain the background fields as follows:
= 0,
Ffield 
 is -independent and is  linear in :
^ij () = B^ij  + i ^  [ (^0^i)_ ^j - (^0^j)_ ^i  ],
Bfield 
 is constant and satisfies the following equation
_permutations of  i,j,k  (-1)^  ^(i)  (^0 ^(j) )_  ^(k)   = 0.
jacobi 
Thus we recover the result of on the deformation of ,   supercoordinate algebra.
In our calculations we do not assume that the spacetime dimension is four.
Thus the form of the deformed supercoordinate algebra that we get from our star-product 
is the same in any spacetime dimension that admits a Majorana representation. 


In the supersymmetric case we consider -independent backgrounds. The action () is supersymmetric if the background
fields satisfy the following equations
_  ^    _ _  &=& 0, (_  ^j  + i (^0 ^j)_  ^ ) _ _j  &=& 0, (_  ^ij  - 2 i (^0 ^i)_ ^j ) _i_j &=& 0.  
susyeq 

The first equation in susyeq  implies that  does not depend on . 
For the -independent backgrounds and the constant  the master equation ()
reduces to
^i  _  ^j k    _i _j _k &=& 0, ( ^ _ ^i j  - 2 ^i _  ^j )  _  _i _j &=& 0,  ^  _  ^k     _ _  _k &=& 0. 
masterpr 
Since 's commute, 
the third equation in masterpr  is equivalent to
^  _   ^k  + ^  _  ^k  = 0.   
feq 
Using the second equation from susyeq ,   feq  can be rewritten as
^  (^0^k)_  ^ +^  (^0^k)_  ^  = 0.
Setting  in this equation, we have
^  _  ^ =0.
Since the action () is hermitian,  is purely imaginary. Furthermore,  is symmetric:
. 
Thus  we conclude from the above equation that  is identically zero: 




The third equation from susyeq  leads to the expression () for .
Using the third equation from susyeq  and the fact that 's anticommute, the first
equation from masterpr  can written as in jacobi . 
  
In the supersymmetric case a closed expression for the star-product can be derived from the path integral. 
It reads
fg (x,) &=&  f(x,)  -i 2   _  ^i  _i i 2  _i ^ij  _j i 2  _i  ^i  _  &&    ^212   ^k  _  ^ij  (_i _j_k - _i _k _j )g(x,).
starproduct 
The Grassmann derivatives  and  in this equation act on the Grassmann variables as follows:
_1 ^2 ^1 = -^2,    _1 ^1 ^2 = ^2,      ^1 ^2 _1 = -^2,     ^2 ^1 _1 = ^2.
conven 
We sketch the path integral derivation of starproduct .  Schematically, we can write  the formula
() 
as
f(X,)   +  g(X,) = _m,n  1m!  1n! 
f(X,)    ^m  ^n g(X,) ,
symbolic 
where  and .
Since  and  are -independent, the 's in  from symbolic  can Wick-contract only with the
functions  and . The Wick contraction of  and  gives a derivative of : .
Furthermore, if one of the 's from  contracts with , then the remaining
 has to contract with  to produce a non-vanishing result. 
This is  because   is anti-symmetric and so  vanishes. We will shortly show
that this type of contraction gives rise to the second exponential factor in starproduct . 
 
The fate of  and 
in  can also be determined:  contracts with  and  contracts with , and vice versa. 
This type of contraction gives rise to the first and third exponential factors in starproduct .
Note that if  and  contract with
the same function, then the corresponding contribution vanishes since the resulting Feynman integral vanishes:
d(a,z)d(a,z) = 0,
where  is a point on the real-axis, by the anticommutativity of the wedge product.

Since  is linear in , it can also contract with  in . The  three 's from  and  have to contract
with the functions  and . This type of contraction gives rise to the last exponential factor in starproduct .

We now do some combinatorics to show that three different types of contractions just described indeed exponentiate 
into the formula (). Let us pick  's and  's from symbolic . There are 
 times  ways of doing that. There are  ways of contracting  's
with  's. Combining these combinatorial factors with the factorials from symbolic  we have
^m-k (m-k)!  ^n-k (n-k)!  ()^k k! .
The fact that the Grassmann partial derivatives in starproduct  act as in conven  comes from the following
observation. Consider the correlator
     (_  ^i  _i) 
where the 's came from the Taylor expansion of . In order to  Wick-contract a  with
, we have to bring it next to the . Thus the Wick-contraction with the  is effectively
equivalent to taking the derivative . 

The numerical coefficients in the exponents in starproduct  can be found using the integralsd(z_1,0)d(z_1,1) = 2^2
integral1 
and
d(z_1,0)d(z_1,1)d(z_2,z_1)d(z_2,1) = 4 ^43 .
integral2 
Each of the correlators ()
 which appear as the coefficients of ,  and  is
proportional to the integral (). The correlator which appears as the coefficient of 
 is proportional to the integral (). The signs in the exponents
in starproduct  can be determined from the path integral as well. 






starproduct  can, alternatively, be derived directly from the algebra () using the Baker-Hausdorff
formula:
^A ^B = ^A+B+12  [A,B]+112  ([A,[A,B]]+[[A,B],B])+ .
Thinking of the star-product as a matrix product and using the Baker-Hausdorff formula, we find:
&&^i (px + ) ^i (p x + ) = &&= ( i(p+p )x + i(+ )+
i 2 (_ ^i p _i+p_i ^i  _ ) &&       -  i 2  p_i p _j^ij  -
i^212   ^k  _  ^ij  (p_i p _j p _k - p_i p_k p _j )).
momprod 
Since
&&^i px  _i = i p_i ^i px ,   _i ^i p x = i p _i ^i p x ,&&^i  _  = i _  ^i  ,   _ ^i   = -i_  ^i   ,
the quadratic and cubic terms in momenta in the exponent in momprod  lead, after the substitutions 
&&p_k -i_k,       p _k-i_k, &&_  -i_ , 
        _ i_ ,
to the star-product starproduct .


 
Summary 
Let us briefly summarize our results:


A path-integral formula () for the associative
star-product of functions of bosonic and fermionic coordinates  is proposed.  is
 taken to be a Majorana
spinor in  spacetime dimensions.   


The BV action  () of the two-dimensional field theory depends on the background fields
,  and  from susyalgmod . From the classical master equation , we
derived the associativity conditions () for the background fields. 

 An operational formula () is given for the star-product of functions of  and 
for general - and -dependent background fields.

  The condition of the supersymmetry 
 invariance of the action () turned out to be very restrictive. The supersymmetric
backgrounds are given by the equations (), () and (). The supersymmetry
transformations () are  or  depending on the dimension  of the spacetime.
An explicit formula () for the supersymmetric star-product is derived from the path-integral.

 
Ref. gives a deformation of ,  superspace using symplectic-Majorana 
spinors. It turns out that a non-vanishing anticommutator 



is compatible with the  supersymmetry. 
With a minor modification of our action () the case of the non-Majorana spinors can be dealt with.
