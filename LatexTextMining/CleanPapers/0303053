Abstract:  
Using topological Yang-Mills theory as example, 
we discuss the definition and  
determination of observables in topological field theories
(of Witten-type) 
within the superspace formulation proposed by Horne. 
This approach to the equivariant cohomology 
leads to a set of bi-descent equations 
involving the BRST and supersymmetry operators 
as well as the exterior derivative. 
This allows us to determine superspace expressions 
for all observables, and thereby to 
recover the Donaldson-Witten polynomials when choosing 
a Wess-Zumino-type gauge.  






Introduction 

Topological field theories have been introduced some fifteen years 
ago  and continue to represent a field 
of active interest, e.g. see ref.. 
The purpose of the present work is to come back to the issue of 
determining all of the observables for these theories (for some 
general reviews, 
see ref. ). These  observables are of a global nature, 
e.g. knot invariants in
 Chern-Simons theory  or Donaldson
invariants in 
 topological Yang-Mills (YM) theory as well as the counterparts of the latter in topological  gravity
. 
For topological YM and gravity theories, these observables 
belong to the so-called equivariant cohomology as originally 
shown by Witten in his
pioneering work on  topological YM theory and further elucidated in the sequel
from the mathematical point of view .  
Equivariant
cohomology amounts to computing the cohomology of a 
supersymmetry-like operator 
 (which is the BRST operator associated to the local shift
symmetry of gauge fields) 
in the space of gauge invariant 
local functionals of the fields. 
A crucial point is that the cohomology of , although empty
in the space of the unrestricted local functionals, becomes
nonempty if gauge invariance is imposed on these 
functionals .

As pointed out by Horne , 
the supersymmetry operator 
may be represented as the derivative with respect to a Grassmann-odd  
parameter  within a superfield formalism 
in which gauge invariance is implemented as 
supergauge invariance following the introduction of a superconnection. 
Although  superfield formulations of this type have been found  
to be quite useful for the discussion of the dynamics 
and symmetries of topological models of Witten-type 
(also termed cohomological field theories) 
, they have 
not been considered so far for the determination of observables. 
The present paper 
fills this gap and shows that one can directly apply 
the powerful methods and results of the BRST cohomology
associated to (super)gauge invariance . 
This provides a complete basis of observables and 
- as expected - it allows us to recover Witten's results which have  
been tackled using other 
approaches in the past .


We shall be fairly explicit in our presentation since the 
present work will serve as a basis 
for the systematic study  of 
more complex
models involving equivariant cohomology
like topological gravity in various 
dimensions and YM theories with more
than one supersymmetry generator .
We note that 
the techniques that we develop for 
the treatment of bi-descent equations 
should also be useful in other contexts where equations of this 
type appear, e.g. see .

Our paper is organized as follows. 
In section , 
we present the general 
framework and, in particular, the BRST formalism 
for topological YM theories in the superspace 
associated with the shift supersymmetry. 
If the  supergauge invariance is fixed by a Wess-Zumino type 
condition, we recover the field content and transformation laws 
that have been 
considered in the original literature .
In section , we determine 
the cohomology of the BRST
operator in the functional space constrained by 
the requirements of supersymmetry 
invariance and zero ghost-number.
We shall see that it corresponds to
a certain
 subset of the cohomology  
 
 of the BRST operator  modulo the exterior derivative  
in the space of differential forms whose coefficients
are superfields.
 Some explicit examples are presented in section . 
An appendix gathers the proofs of several lemmas and 
propositions presented in the main body of the text. 

Although the formalism is motivated by -dimensional topological
YM theories, the value of the spacetime dimension
will not be specified. 
In fact, we shall not consider the dynamics nor 
address the problem of gauge-fixing
(requiring the introduction of antighosts
and Lagrange multiplier fields)
and thereby our results have a purely algebraic character. 
In particular, they are completely independent of the 
spacetime dimension.


Symmetries      


 

Topological field theories of Witten-type 
can be obtained from extended supersymmetric 
gauge theories by performing 
an appropriate twist. The invariance under extended 
supersymmetry transformations
then gives rise to a shift symmetry in the  
topological model. Thus, the latter invariance 
is often referred to as 
supersymmetry transformation and it can be conveniently 
described in a superspace . 
The superspace formulation that we shall use is the one 
of Horne , though the latter author did
not elaborate on supergauge transformations 
whose inclusion is essential for the discussion
of observables. Let us first introduce superspace and 
the geometric objects that it supports. 
   

Superspace 
We extend the -dimensional
spacetime manifold by a single Grassmannian  
variable  so as to obtain a superspace parametrized 
by local coordinates . 
We assign a "supersymmetry-number" 
(SUSY-number  or SUSY-charge  for short) 
to all fields 
and variables(Originally this number 
was referred to as "ghost-number"  
.) :
for the variable , this number is 
and, quite generally, an upper or lower -index 
on a field corresponds to a SUSY-number  or , respectively. 

A superfield  is a function on superspace, 
 
where  has the same Grassmann parity as 
while its superpartner  has the opposite parity.
To be more precise, the superfield (and thereby its components) 
is also supposed to transform in a specific way under
supersymmetry transformations, 
see eqs.() below. 

A -superform  admits the expansion 
_p (x,) = k=0 p   _p-k (x,)  (d)^k
 ,
s-form 
where  has  lower
-indices that we did not
 spell out. 
The components  of the -superform 
() are -forms
whose coefficients are superfields:
_q (x,) = 1 q!   __1_q (x,) 
 dx^_1 dx^_q 
= _q (x) + _q  ' (x)
 .
gform 
Superspace expressions of the form gform  will be referred to as 
superfield forms  in the sequel.
In the expansion gform  and in the following, 
the wedge product symbol is always omitted.
Moreover, we shall adhere to the notational conventions 
used in the previous expressions:
functions or forms on ordinary spacetime are 
denoted by small case letters 
(e.g. ), 
superfields or superfield forms by upper case letters
(e.g. ) 
and -superforms with 
(e.g. )
by upper case letters with a
"hat".


The exterior derivative in superspace is defined by
= d+dwith d = dx^_ .
s-ext-der 
We have 
 where the bracket 
 denotes the graded 
commutator.

A global, infinitesimal supersymmetry transformation
 is given by a translation of the -variable, i.e.
. Thus, it is a supercoordinate
transformation generated by the vector field 

where  represents the supersymmetry generator.
The latter operator is nilpotent (i.e. )
and it raises the SUSY-number
by one unit. The supersymmetry transformations 
of the superfield () and of its component fields read as
c 
   Q F =  _  F 
  Q f = f_ '
,
Q f_ ' =0
 .
def-Q 
Following standard practice, we use the same symbol  
to denote the action of the supersymmetry generator  
on either component fields or on superfields, superfield forms and
superforms. On each of the latter,  acts by virtue of the
-derivative.
Thus, any superfield () or superform s-form 
has the general form 
 

While an ordinary -form can be integrated over 
a manifold of dimension , there is no 
directly analogous theory of integration 
for superforms. 
Yet one can introduce some algebraic integration rules
which are quite useful for the discussion of descent 
equations in the BRST formalism. 
To do so, we consider a collection 

of closed 
spacetime manifolds  of dimension 
and we define the spacetime integral of a -superform 
on this collection by
the direct sum(A manifold of dimension  represents
a point, , and 
.) 
_M  _p (x,) _k=0 ^p  
(d)^k _M_p-k   _p-k (x,)
 .
integral 
This expression still depends on . 
Since integration with respect to the Grassmannian variable
 means derivation with respect to  (i.e. the
operation ), we set




or, more explicitly, 
_ _M  _p (x,) 
_k=0 ^p  
(d)^k _M_p-k   Q _p-k (x,)
= 
 _k=0 ^p   (d)^k 
_M_p-k   _p-k '(x)
 .
s-integral 
The so-defined expression can be referred to as 
superspace integral of a -superform.





BRST-formalism    
Within the BRST-formalism, the parameters of infinitesimal 
symmetry transformations are turned into ghost fields.
The latter have ghost-number   while the 
fundamental fields
appearing in the invariant action 
(i.e. the connection for topological YM theory)
have
a vanishing ghost-number.
 The Grassmann parity of an object is given by the
parity of its total degree  defined as the sum  of 
its form degree ,  its ghost-number  and its SUSY-number .
All commutators and  brackets are assumed to be graded 
according to this grading. 



Topological Yang-Mills theory in 
superspace 
The basic variables are the connection -superform 

and the ghost superfield  which corresponds  to
infinitesimal supergauge transformations. 
These variables are Lie algebra valued, i.e.  








where the matrices  represent the generators of the
Lie group that is  
chosen as structure group of the theory.

The BRST transformations of  and  
describing the supergauge invariance of the theory 
read as 
= -( C +[ ,C ] ) 
,
C =  -C^2 
 .
BRS-super 
The so-defined BRST operator  is nilpotent,
i.e. . 

Let us now introduce the
components of the -superform
, 
= A(x,) + d A_(x,) ,
agf 
as well as the spacetime components of all superfield forms:
 
Here,  denotes the connection -form associated 
to ordinary gauge transformations and  the corresponding ghost.
In the sequel, 
the covariant derivative with respect to 
will be denoted by  
and the -indices labeling spacetime fields
will 
 be omitted in order to simplify the notation.

Substitution of agf  into BRS-super  yields 
the BRST transformations of  and , 
A= -(dC +[A,C]) -D_A  C ,
A_=  
- (_C + [A_, C ]) 
s-superfields 
and the expansions aac  provide 
the BRST transformations of the spacetime fields:  
  ll 
a =  -D_a c   ,&c  =  -c^2 
= - [c,]  - D_a c'  
 ,&  c' =  -[c,c'] = - [c,] - [,c']  ,&   =   - [c,] - c'  
 .
BRS-comp  
The supersymmetry transformations  of all component
fields appearing in aac 
follow from def-Q :
  lll 
 Qa =   ,& Q=   ,& Qc = c' 
 
 Q=0  ,& Q=0  ,& Qc' =0  
 .
ssc  
We have the graded commutation relations 




It is quite useful to consider the following redefinitions
of superfields: 
rl 
 & _  A + D_A A_
= +  D_A A_& _  A_+ A_^2 
= + A_^2  
K  & -( _C + [A_,C] )  
= -c' - [A_, C]  .
s-field-red 
In fact, in terms of these expressions, 
the -expansion of the supercurvature form 
 reads as 
= F_A  +  d+  (d)^2  , 
with  F_A  = dA+A^2  , 
s-curvature 
while the BRST transformations read as 
  ll 
A =  -D_A C   ,& C  =  -C^2 
= - [C,]  ,&  = - [C,] A_=  K  , &   K = 0  ,  
BRS-redef  
and the supersymmetry transformations are given by 
rll 
QA  & =  - D_A  A_ , 
& Q = - D_A  - [ A_, ] 
QF_A   &= -D_A - [A_,F_A ]  , 
& Q = -[A_,]  .
susy-redef  
We note that  acts on  and the curvature  
 according to 



with 
 
Thus, the operator  is nilpotent when acting on an invariant
polynomial depending on the variables 
. 

In this paper, all space-time forms will be taken as polynomials of the
basic forms  and their -derivatives.
Superfield forms and superforms will be taken as polynomials of the
basic superfield forms  and their - and 
-derivatives. 
Since we only discuss the kinematics, we do not fix a priori 
the space-time dimension.
The respective functional spaces will be denoted by
 :  space-time forms  , :  superfield forms  , :  superforms  .
funct-spaces 

We conclude this section with two results 
which will be important for our investigations:

 []
Proposition .1 
The cohomology  of the supersymmetry operator  in the space
,  or  is trivial, i.e. 
l 
If    Q =0  ,then = Q ^   , 
with both     and   ^ 
 belonging to either   ,  or  
 . 
prop2-1 
Proof:  
For the functional space ,the proof follows from the fact 
that all fields represent -doublets  with  and
, and from a well-known result according to which such
doublets do not contribute  to the cohomology 
(e.g. see proposition 5.8. of reference ). 
The extension of this result to the spaces
 and  is straightforward, 
the action of the operator 
 being given on these spaces by 
the derivative . 

 []
Proposition .2  ("Algebraic Poincare Lemma").
The cohomology  of the exterior derivative  in the
space ,  or  is trivial.
Proof:  The result for the space  
is well known  within the present context 
where the space-time dimension is not fixed a priori.  
The extension to the spaces  or  follows 
by considering an expansion in  or in  and ,
respectively, 
and by using the linearity of . 
Topological Yang-Mills in the Wess-Zumino 
gauge 
Symmetry transformations in the 
WZ-gauge    
The supergauge freedom can be reduced to the ordinary gauge freedom
by imposing the 
Wess-Zumino (WZ) supergauge  condition
= 0 .
wz-cond 
By virtue of eqs.BRS-comp , the -invariance of this
condition
 requires . The -variations BRS-comp  
then reduce to the
BRST transformations in the WZ-gauge  which describe  
ordinary gauge transformations:
a=-D_a c ,
,
,
c=-c^2 .
BRST-WZ 
Condition wz-cond 
is not invariant under the
SUSY generator , i.e. under the variations ssc .    
A modified
SUSY operator  which leaves this condition 
stable is obtained by
combining  with a compensating BRST transformation () 
according to
 = Q + .  _= c=0, c'= 

on    a, , 
 .
WZ-Q 
Thus, we get the supersymmetry transformations in the 
WZ-gauge , 
ll 
a = ,
=  
-D_a,
= 0
 ,
Q-transf-WZ 
which satisfy
^2 = infinitesimal
gauge transformation with parameter  
  .
nilp  
A crucial point of the theory is the fact that the operator 
 is nilpotent when acting on invariant polynomials, 
very much like the operator  defined in qqq . 
We also note that the algebra generated 
by the forms ,  and 
and their exterior derivatives,  
together with the action of the operators   and  
given by BRST-WZ  and Q-transf-WZ  
is isomorphic to the algebra generated by the superfield forms
,  and  (defined in eq.s-field-red )
and their exterior derivatives,  
together with the action of the 
operators   and  given by 
BRS-redef  and qqq . 

The supersymmetry-BRST formalism defined by 
eqs.Q-transf-WZ  and BRST-WZ 
is the one used by Witten in his pioneering  
work on four-dimensional topological
YM theory . 
We emphasize that the only ghost field in this approach is 
(as well as  in a general supergauge). This fact is in 
contrast to some other approaches where  and  have 
ghost-numbers  and , respectively (e.g. 
see )(In fact, in these approaches 
our ghost- and SUSY-numbers are added together so as to yield a single 
BRST ghost-number.) .

For later reference, we display the -expansion
of the superconnection  and of the associated 
curvature  in the WZ-gauge 
(cf. s-curvature ):
 


Witten's observables and descent 
equations 
The expression wzf  of  has the form 
F = F  +  F  
with     
F  F_a  +  d+  (d)^2 
 ,
univ 
i.e. it is of the same form as a generic superform 
in a general gauge, cf. eq.gensu .
More specifically, one can check that we have  
F  =
- (D_a F ) 
 (d)^-1 
 , 
aqt  
where the notation  is symbolic, though 
it can be further justified. 

The quantity  represents the curvature 
of the universal bundle considered by 
Baulieu and Singer in their derivation of Witten's observables. 
(Actually, these authors 
did not introduce the monomials , rather they 
associated ghost-numbers  and  to  
 and , respectively.) 
For the derivation of observables, we can argue as follows.
For , we have 




where the first term yields the 
Donaldson-Witten polynomials ,
 
 and where the second term represents a total derivative by virtue of 
 eq.aqt :
 



By substituting the expansion expsi  into the last relation, 
we obtain Witten's descent equations  for the polynomials :
_p + d_p-1  = 0
 
( p = 0, 1, , 2m  )  
 .
wdes 
Here and in the following, the forms of negative form degree 
are assumed to vanish by convention.



Combining all symmetries 
It is possible to incorporate the transformations 
Q-transf-WZ 
into the BRST algebra
by introducing a constant
commuting  ghost :
the BRST operator then acts on  according to  
= +Q
s-WZ 
and on  according to 
c = -c^2 +  ^2 
, 
=0 
 ,
s-c-WZ 
which ensures the nilpotency of the operator .
More explicitly, we have the expansion = _0 +_1 + ^2 _2
 ,
exps 
with
lll 
_0 a =  
-D_a c  
 ,&_1 a =  ,&_2 a =0 
_0 =  - [c,]   ,&_1 = 
-D_a 
 ,&_2 =0 
_0 =  - [c,]  ,&_1 = 0 ,&_2 =0 
_0 c  =  -c^2   ,&_1 c = 0 ,&_2 c = .
mag  
where
(_0)^2 =0  ,[_0, _1]=0   ,
(_1)^2+ [_0, _2]=0  
 .
fil 
In terms of the notation introduced above, we
have  and  on .
If we only consider functionals  depending on 
and not  on  (i.e. functionals of zero ghost-number), then the last
relation of fil  is nothing but nilp .
If these functionals are, in addition, gauge invariant, 
then the operator   is nilpotent:
_0 =  0 = _2 
(_1)^2 =0
 .
crux 
Its cohomology is referred to as equivariant cohomology 
and will be further discussed in the next section.
(Thus, equivariant cohomology  
is the cohomology of the operator 
 in the space of local functionals of 
 and  restricted  
by  - and  - invariance.)

To conclude, we note that the algebra ()() can
also be obtained along a slightly different, though equivalent line of
reasoning.  In fact, we could include the supersymmetry variations 
generated by
 
 right away into the BRST transformations ():  
the stability of the WZ-condition ()
then restricts the ghost field  to be equal to
 and readily yields the results ()().
The decoupling BRST-WZ Q-transf-WZ  is 
realizedby considering the filtration  
and  the expansion exps .




Observables in the superspace 
formalism 

In the following, the expression 
 denotes a 
-form  of ghost-number  and SUSY-number .


Equivariant cohomology and 
Witten's observables 
Let us first consider the WZ-gauge  setting described in
the preceding
 section since the latter has been chosen in 
all former discussions of observables.
The representation ()-() of the complete 
set of symmetry transformations is quite useful for specifying the 
cohomological characterization of observables.
As is well known, the cohomology of the operator 
is  empty . 
Not so the equivariant
cohomology 
which can be described in several 
different 
ways .
As mentioned in the last section, it can be characterized 
as the cohomology of the operator  
(defined by Q-transf-WZ ) in the space
of the
gauge invariant local functionals of .
Thus, at form degree zero , one looks for a local functional 

which solves the -cocycle condition, i.e. 
Q  ^s  _(0)  = 0
 , 
Q-cohom  
and which is constrained by gauge invariance, i.e. 
 ^s  _(0)  = 0
 . 
gconstr 
This cocycle is required to be non-trivial, i.e. 
 ^s  _(0)  =
 ^s-1   _(0) '
with  
 ^s-1   _(0) ' = 0
 , 
qnontriv 
where .
From the -transformation laws Q-transf-WZ , it follows that 
zero-forms cannot be written as a -variation. 
Thus, the non-triviality condition qnontriv  is automatically satisfied  
at form degree zero. (Note that this is no longer true 
at higher form degree: an expression of the form 
P_inv  (F_a, , , , D_a  , D_a )
 , 
mgs 
where  is a -invariant polynomial, 
is - and -invariant, but  -trivial.)
As pointed out by Witten , the equations for the 
integrand of , i.e. 
, are solved
by the gauge invariant
polynomials . Thereby, the equivariant 
cohomology is given by the differential forms generated from
these polynomials by virtue of the descent equations
of  modulo , i.e. eqs.wdes .
After integrating each of these forms over closed cycles, one obtains
global observables which only depend on the homology class of these
cycles. These observables will be referred to as Witten's observables .

Equivalently, the equivariant
cohomology can be defined as the
cohomology of the BRST 
 operator  restricted to the space of
local functionals
 of   which are independent of  and 
gauge invariant .
The mathematical techniques of equivariant cohomology 
 then allow to construct 
some cohomology representatives which turn out 
to coincide with Witten's observables. However, a complete 
determination of the cohomology classes along these lines 
seems to be a difficult task. 

Yet, one can also apply standard cohomological techniques
while working in a restricted functional space.
Using this approach, the authors of reference  found that 
the solution of the cohomological problem 
is given by certain -cohomology classes 
of ghost-number zero (reproducing again Witten's observables). 
This result suggests to 
look for representatives of the equivariant cohomology within 
the cohomology of the operator  (describing gauge
transformations, see ()-()) in the space of  
local functionals
of   which are of ghost-number zero and 
invariant under the supersymmetry operator .
From this view-point, one looks for a non-trivial 
solution of the -cocycle
condition 
which satisfies the constraint
, 
where the non-triviality requirement now 
concerns the -operator, i.e. 
 ^s  _(d)  =
 ^s  _(d) '
with  
 ^s  _(d) ' = 0
 .
snontriv 
 However,  is of ghost-number zero and we do not have any
  fields of ghost-number minus one, therefore the non-triviality condition
  snontriv  is automatically satisfied
  whatever the form degree .
Thus, at form degree zero, this approach also reduces to 
the cohomology problem ()()
without any further requirements.
At higher form degree, it regards as non- trivial 
the solutions of the form () which are trivial 
representatives of equivariant cohomology. 

The latter approach can 
easily 
be extended beyond the WZ-gauge: 
in a general supergauge, 
the  equivariant cohomology
can be determined by looking for 
the ghost-number zero
cohomology classes of the
BRST operator BRS-super  
or BRS-comp  in 
the space of the supersymmetric local functionals  
(the supersymmetry transformations being 
defined by means of the operator  according to ssc ). 
In the following, we shall completely determine this cohomology
while working within the superspace
formalism, only specifying to the WZ-gauge ()
towards the end.


Thus, let us consider a fixed SUSY-number  
and a fixed degree . 
The task is to find a solution of the cocycle condition 
 ^s _(d)  = 0   , 
 s-cohomol 
satisfying the SUSY constraint 
Q ^s  _(d)  = 0
 . 
Q-constraints 
Here, 

^s _(d) =_M_d   ^s  _d^0 (x)
observ  
denotes a local functional
of SUSY-number 
which depends on the components of the 
 superfield forms  and their exterior
derivatives.
Since the solution of 
the problem  s-cohomol Q-constraints 
proceeds in several steps, 
we shall present a summary of results at the end 
of each of the following sections. 


Our discussion will be purely algebraic and does not assume a 
specification of the spacetime dimension . 
If the latter is specified, all forms of degree greater than
 vanish identically. 
Those of degree  smaller than   can be integrated over  
oriented submanifolds . The latter manifolds 
are assumed to be closed
which implies the absence of boundary terms upon
integration over . 
Thus, we exclude from our discussion the "trivial" solution of 
s-cohomol Q-constraints 
which exists for , 

^0 _(2m) = _M_2m    ^0  _2m  ^0 
 _M_2m   F_a ^m ( m = 1,2,  )  , 
trivobserv  
since the Pontrjagin density 
 is 
locally given by the exterior derivative of the 
Chern-Simons form of degree . 

Before tackling the cohomological problem in full generality, we already 
note that the determination of observables 
that we presented for the WZ-gauge 
in subsection  can be generalized to a general
supergauge as follows.

According to equation gensu ,
the curvature -superform has the 
general form




where the first term 
of this expansion
can also be written as
. (In the WZ-gauge, the latter 
expression reduces to the form  introduced in eq.().)
For , 
the -superform  
admits an analogous expression: 
 
Since  is a closed superform, 





it follows by projection onto the  component that 





By substituting the expansion () into this relation, 
we get Witten's descent equations in a general supergauge : 
 
Explicit expressions for the polynomials  
for  and  will be given in section  
below and here we only note that 

 whatever the value of .  
The task of the next subsections  is to 
determine if other solutions can 
be obtained by virtue of a systematic study in superspace.    








The bi-descent equations 
In this section, we shall show that the cohomological problem
 s-cohomol Q-constraints 
leads to a set of bi-descent
equations involving superfield forms.
Let us first solve the SUSY constraint Q-constraints  for
 given by observ .
For the integrand , 
it implies
Q^s  _d^0 + d^s+1   _d-1 ^0 = 0 .
cond1 
In view of this relation, we shall prove  
the following  proposition:
 [] 
Proposition .1    
Let  and  be non-negative integers.  
(Here, we do not refer to the ghost-number which 
only represents a passive label in this proposition.)

(i) The cocycle condition
Q^s  _p  + d^s+1   _p-1   = 0
lemma1a 
implies the   modulo  triviality of the space-time form  

and the  modulo  triviality of the space-time form 
:
 
with the same  space-time form  appearing in both
equations.
 
(ii) The same result holds for superfield forms, i.e.  
Q ^s  _p  + d^s+1   _p-1   = 0
L1a  
implies
 

Proof:  See appendix .



With the help of this proposition, we deduce from cond1  that
^s  _d^0 =  Q^s-1   _d^0 
 .
Q-omega 
Here and in the following, the total derivative term is suppressed
without loss of generality, since it 
does not contribute to the integrated cocycle .
Furthermore, without loss of generality, we can assume 
 
 to be a superfield form 
^s-1   _d^0 = ^s-1   _d^0 +  Q^s-1  _d^0   ,
Q-superfield 
 so that Q-omega 
reads as




Since the operator  acts on superfield forms by the  
-derivative,
this shows that 
 is the superspace integral
of 
: 
Q  ^s  _(d)  = 0 ^s  _(d)  = _M_d Q^s-1   _d^0  .
obs-d-s1 

Next, we turn to the cocycle condition s-cohomol . 
Since the cohomology of  in the space of local 
field polynomials is trivial ,
this condition implies 
the descent equations (Every form of negative form degree, 
ghost-number or SUSY-number is assumed to vanish by convention.) 

 ^s   _p^d-p  + d ^s  _p-1 ^d-p+1  = 0
( p= 
0,, d  )  .
desc-s-d 
 []
Lemma 1 
The SUSY constraint implies that
every form in desc-s-d 
(and not just the one of highest form degree, i.e. ) 
can be written as
a SUSY variation, 
^s   _p^d-p  = Q ^s-1   _p^d-p  
( p= 0,, d  )  ,
th-deriv 
where  is a   
superfield form.


The proof of this statement proceeds by induction, 
see appendix . 



We note that in eqs.desc-s-d  and thus in th-deriv  
and in the equations to follow, 
the array of descent equations may terminate at some positive 
form degree that we denote by 
. 
(A simple illustration of such a "termination of descent"
within abelian gauge theory 
(with field strength )
is given by the cocycles
 and  , 
which satisfy  and 
, so that 
in this case.) 
In such a case, we use the convention that every form 
of form degree less than  is vanishing.


We are now going to prove:   
 []
Proposition .3  
For given values of  and ,
the descent equations desc-s-d  together with the 
SUSY constraint
th-deriv  imply a set
of descent equations 
involving superfield forms and all of the three indices:
c 
^s-r-1   _p ^d-p+r  +  d^s-r-1   _p-1 ^d-p+r+1 
+ Q^s-r-2   _p ^d-p+r+1  = 0 ( r=0,,s-1 ;p= 0,,d  )  .
bi-descent 
We shall call this set of equations 
the bi-descent equations for the pair  .

Proof:  
In order to derive this result, we first rewrite desc-s-d , using
the 
 result
th-deriv , as 




The triviality of the -cohomology then implies
^s-1   _p ^d-p  +  d^s-1   _p-1 ^d-p+1 
+ Q^s-2   _p ^d-p+1  = 0 ( p= 0,,d  )  ,
bi-desc-0 
where  is again taken  to be 
a superfield form.
The latter equation is nothing but bi-descent  with . 
The validity of the bi-descent equations for all values of   
is shown by induction, see appendix . 

q.e.d.   




The bi-descent equations 
for the pair  as given by eqs.bi-descent   
involve the forms  
which all have the same  total degree
D=d+s-1  .
tot-deg 
In the following, we shall consider this number to be fixed to some 
arbitrary value . 
For given values of  and  related by tot-deg ,
the bi-descent equations for the pair  
then become the bi-descent equations for the pair  ,  
i.e. the same set of equations with a different labeling of
ghost- and SUSY-indices:
c 
^D-p-g   _p ^g  +  d^D-p-g   _p-1 ^g+1 
+ Q^D-p-g-1   _p ^g+1  = 0  ( p= 0,,d;g=d-p,,D-p  )    .
bi-descent" 
We note that the domain of variation of the indices  and  
in this set of equations is a
parallelogram 
in the  plane
which is bounded by the straight lines 
, ,
 and . 
More precisely, each point of 
represents exactly one of the 
bi-descent equations bi-descent" ,
these equations being parametrized by the form degree and ghost-number of 
the -term.
The example  is presented in detail in section . 



Summary: 
By definition, the observables of the theory are the 
integrated local functionals 
 
of the form observ  
satisfying the cocycle condition s-cohomol 
and the supersymmetry constraint
Q-constraints . 
For a fixed maximal degree 
, they are given by  
superspace integrals of superfield -forms
of ghost-number , i.e. 
^D-d+1   _(d)  = _M_d Q^D-d   _d^0

( d = 0 , , D  )  , 
obs-d-s 
where  is a non-trivial solution 
of the bi-descent equations 
for the pair  , i.e. eqs.bi-descent" .








Superform solutions of the bi-descent 
equations 

When varying  from  to its maximum value , the 
parallelograms  
fill up the triangle  of
vertices ,  and . 
The points of this triangle describe in a one-to-one fashion 
the bi-descent equations for the forms of total degree  ,  
i.e. the  bi-descent equations for the pairs  with 
:
c 
^D-p-g   _p ^g  +  d^D-p-g   _p-1 ^g+1 
+ Q^D-p-g-1   _p ^g+1  = 0 (  p0 ,g0,p+gD  )   .
bi-descent' 
The bi-descent equations bi-descent"  
represent subsets of the latter equations which are 
closed in the sense that each equation of 
bi-descent'  corresponding to a
point    only involves 
forms corresponding to points of , i.e. 
it represents an equation of the set bi-descent" . 
Hence a non-trivial solution of bi-descent'  
also represents a solution of  bi-descent" . 
However, the converse is not necessarily true.
Indeed, two forms  and
 belonging to the intersection of two
parallelograms  and   
might represent different solutions of the two
corresponding sets of bi-descent equations.


In this subsection, we shall look for solutions of the  
system of equations 
bi-descent' , thereby 
providing a special set of solutions
of the bi-descent equations  bi-descent" .
The search of the general solution of eqs.bi-descent"  is
postponed to section .

We first introduce the set of 
-superforms (cf. eq.s-form )
_q ^D-q  = p=0 q ^q-p   _p^D-q 
 (d)^q-p   
 ( q=0,,D  ) ,
s-forms 
which contains all of the 
superfield forms appearing in equations bi-descent' .
In fact, the superform
 contains the superfield forms of ghost-number , 
i.e. those located on the horizontal line  of the 
triangle .
It is easy to check that the equations bi-descent'  
are equivalent to the
superdescent equations 
_q ^D-q  + _q-1 ^D-q+1 =0
( q=0,,D  )  ,
s-descent 
where  denotes the exterior derivative in superspace, see
eq.s-ext-der . 
This equivalence allows us to solve the bi-descent equations 
bi-descent'  in superspace in terms of
superforms. 
In fact, in this subsection, we shall only be interested in superforms
which are
 polynomials of the basic superforms ,  and
their exterior superderivatives.

The corresponding observables obs-d-s  are then 
obtained by integrating a non-trivial solution 
 of the superdescent equations s-descent 
over the collection     of manifolds
according to s-integral :
  _(D)  _  _M   _D^0
= p=0 D  ^D-p+1  _(p)   (d)^D-p  
 , 
dirsum 
where each of the expressions   involves another 
component of the superform  (cf.s-forms ): 
^D-p+1  _(p)  = _M_p  Q ^D-p  _p^0
_M_p   ^D-p+1  _p^0 
 ( p = 0, , D  ) 
   .
  super-obs 

Here, a solution  of  s-descent 
 is considered to be non-trivial if it 
cannot be written as .

Let us now determine the 
non-trivial solutions of the superdescent 
equations s-descent , i.e. the elements of the cohomology 

of the BRST operator 
modulo the superderivative , in the space 
of the local polynomials of
the superconnection , the superghost  and 
their -derivatives. 
Since the BRST transformations BRS-super  
for  and   
have exactly the same structure as in ordinary pure 
YM theory, the well known results  valid in the latter theory
(see reference  and the
reviews ) 
can directly be applied after putting "hats" on all quantities.
We will use the notation of reference .

First, we introduce the following supercocycles:
l 
_r(C) = (-1)^m_r -1   m_r !  (m_r -1)! g_r ! 
 C^g_r  ( g_r=2m_r-1  ) 

f_r() = ^m_r  
 (  r= 1,, rank  G   ) .
s-cohom 
Here,  is the curvature
of the superconnection  and the
index  labels the  Casimir
operator of the structure group (gauge group) , whose degree is
denoted by .
The cocycles () 
are related by superdescent equations involving 
superforms 
of form degree  and ghost-number :
c 
_r _p^g_r-p  
+ _r _p-1 ^g_r-p+1 
=0
( p=0,, g_r 
 ) 
 ,with 
_r _0^g_r  = _r(C)
and  
_r ^0_g_r  = f_r() .
desc-theta 
According to the last equation, the "top" superform 
 is the 
Chern-Simons superform of degree  
associated to the 
Casimir operator.
 
Obviously, desc-theta  corresponds 
to the superdescent
equations s-descent 
and thus yields a solution of the latter equations. 
More general solutions are found 
by multiplying the cocycle 
by a certain number of factors  since
the latter are both - and -invariant. 
Thus, we introduce 
the following supercocycle (belonging to the -cohomology  in the
space ):
c 
_R _r_1  (C) 
f_r_2 ()f_r_L () ,with  
L1  , r_i r_i+1  .
s-d-cohom 
This cocycle is 
of ghost-number  and superform 
degree  (cf.s-cohom ).
By virtue of equations desc-theta , the superforms 
^g_r_1 -p _D_R+p  =  _r_1  ^g_r_1 -p _p
f_r_2 ()f_r_L ()
(
p=0,,g_r_1   ;  L1 )  
3.x 
obey the superdescent equations
_D_R+p ^g_r_1 -p  + _D_R+p-1 ^g_r_1 -p+1  = 0
( p  = 0,, g_r_1   )  .
s-descent-part 
The most general solution of the superdescent equations s-descent 
in the space  is obtained by considering a supercocycle
of the form () which is non-linear in the monomials
. However, in view of the construction of observables 
(which have zero ghost-number by definition), 
we are only interested in the most general solution containing 
superforms of ghost-number  and the latter are given by 
() according to the results of section 10.7
of reference , adapted to the present superspace
formalism.

The corresponding observables are now constructed according to 
()(), by using 3.x  for , i.e. 
rl 
& ^0 _D  =  _r_1  ^0 _g_r_1  
f_r_2 ()f_r_L ()
 p=0 D  ^D-p  ^0_p (d)^D-p  
 , with  & D=D_R+g_r_1  
= 2  i=1 L   m_r_i  -1 
 , L 1  .
3.xx 
Note that  is necessarily odd. 


There is an alternative way of writing the observables
which amounts to a simpler manner of 
extracting the polynomials 
from the superform . This procedure is 
suggested by the fact that the
exterior derivative 
differs from the superspace SUSY operator  
by a factor  and the addition of a spacetime derivative. 
Indeed, let us consider the exterior derivative of  and
write its expansion with respect to 
(see ()()):
c 
^0_D =
f_r_1 ()  f_r_L () 
= f_r_1 (F_A) f_r_L (F_A) 
+ p=0 D   ^D+1-p W^0_p    (d)^D+1-p    , 
exp-hd-OM 
with 
* 
Henceforth, in the integral super-obs 
which yields the observables, 
we can substitute the form 
by
 the value of  at :
c 
^D-p+1 _(p)  = _M_p   ^D-p+1 w_p^0 
( p = 0, , D  ) ,with ^D-p+1 w_p^0  = 
. ^D-p+1 W_p^0_ .
super-obs' 
 
Before concluding, 
we note that application of the superderivative
 to exp-hd-OM  and use of its nilpotency, leads to 





which, taken at , yields 
Q ^D-p+1  w ^0_p + d^D-p+2  w ^0_p-1  =0 
( p = 0, , D  )
 .
Witten-Q 
These relations for the integrands 
of the observables super-obs'  
are nothing but Witten's descent equations 
in a general supergauge (generalizing 
eqs.wdes  which hold in the WZ-gauge and  
involve  rather than ). 
In the WZ-gauge, the polynomials  reduce 
- by construction - to the Donaldson-Witten polynomials discussed in
subsection 2.4.2. 
In particular, in the WZ-gauge, we obtain 
^D+1 ^0 _0 
= f_r_1 () f_r_L ()
with     
L 1 , r_ir_i+1 
 ,
Witten-0-form 
i.e.  Witten's well-known result  that 
the algebra of observables is generated, at form degree zero, by the
invariant monomials . 
The examples  and  will be presented in more detail 
in section . 

Anticipating the discussion of the next subsection, which
shows that there are no other non -trivial observables, 
we can summarize our results as follows. 


Summary:  
Apart from the 'trivial' observables (), 
there exist further ones. 
All of these observables, as defined by the conditions 
s-cohomol  and Q-constraints , are
given by eqs.super-obs' .
In the latter expressions, 
the superfield forms  are 
the coefficients appearing in the expansion 
exp-hd-OM , the superform  
being the non-trivial solution 3.xx  of the 
superdescent equations s-descent  in the space  of 
polynomials
in the basic superforms ,  and their exterior superderivatives.
The forms  satisfy the generalization
of Witten's descent equations to a general supergauge, 
i.e. eqs.Witten-Q .



General solution of the bi-descent 
equations for the pair  
As noted at the beginning of the last section,  
the solutions of the superdescent equations s-descent  in the space
 (which is generated by the 
superforms  and the operators 
) represent  
a priori  only a special set of solutions of the 
bi-descent equations for the pair , 
i.e. eqs.bi-descent" . 
Henceforth, we have to determine the general
non-trivial solution of the latter equations in order to obtain
the general set of observables. 
At this point, we only state and comment on the main result,  
leaving the proof  for appendix .

 []
Proposition .4 
The general solution of the bi-descent equations bi-descent" 
for the pair  is generated, at ghost-number zero,  by two
classes of solutions. The first one is given by the superfield
forms 
rl 
^D-d ^0_d 
 (d)^D-d  
 & =_r_1 ^0_g_r_1   
f_r_2 () f_r_L () _s=D-d,p=d  
with      D &= 2 i=1 L  m_r_i  -1 
 , L1 ,
gen-sol-1 
where the Chern-Simons superform 
and supercurvature invariant  are defined
by ()().

The second class of solutions depends on the 
superfield forms 
and  defined in eqs.s-curvature s-field-red 
and it is given by 
^D-d ^0_d = 
^D-d ^0_d(F_A,,,D_A ,D_A )  .
gen-sol-2 
Here, 
 is an arbitrary invariant polynomial of its
arguments, 
which has a form degree  and SUSY-number 
and which is non-trivial in the sense that 

. 

Proof:  See appendix .

Concerning the invariant forms gen-sol-2 , 
we note that they represent
the general cohomology classes of the BRST operator  in
the space  by virtue of a mere 
adaptation of the results of section 8
of reference .

According to (), 
the observables are obtained as integrals
of the -variation of the 
solutions gen-sol-1 gen-sol-2  
over a -dimensional  manifold.
The ones corresponding to gen-sol-1  
coincide with the corresponding expressions 
calculated in section  
(i.e. super-obs'  with ) since the 
corresponding integrands only differ by a total derivative.
In fact, for , the superfield forms 
given in gen-sol-1  are nothing but those introduced in 3.xx .
Hence, the solutions gen-sol-1  provide the same observables
as the superform solutions 3.xx .

On the other hand, 
for the solutions gen-sol-2 , one gets the integrals 
^D-d+1 _(d)  = 
_M_d  Q ^D-d ^0_d(F_A,,,D_A ,D_A ) .
triv-obs 
As pointed out after equation susy-redef ,  
the operator  simply reduces to  when acting 
on an invariant polynomial . 
Yet, as noted after equation nilp , the action of  
is isomorphic to the one of the operator  
describing supersymmetry transformations in the WZ-gauge.
This means that the solution triv-obs , 
if written out in the WZ-gauge, is simply  
the -variation of a gauge invariant polynomial.
Thus, it is 
trivial  in the sense of equivariant cohomology , see
eqs.()-().
This explicitly shows that the cohomology  defined by equations 
s-cohomol -Q-constraints  is not  
equivalent to the equivariant cohomology: the
difference is precisely given by the expressions of the form
triv-obs , which are manifestly -trivial.

We conclude that, apart from the solutions gen-sol-2  which
are "equivariantly" trivial, the general  solution of the bi-descent
equations that we described in this section 
does not yield any more solutions than 
those obtained in terms of superforms  in section .
In other words, the solution constructed by 
using superforms represents 
the most general, equivariantly non-trivial expression for the observables. 




Explicit expressions 


An example of bi-descent and superdescent

 equations 

There is a graphical way of representing the 
sets of bi-descent equations 
which allows us to exhibit explicitly the combinatorics 
leading to the superdescent equations s-descent . 

By way of illustration, let us 
 consider the case of total degree .
We have 10 superfield forms  
in the bi-descent equations 
for total degree , i.e. eqs.bi-descent' ,  
which can be represented in the 
 diagram: 










E.g. the point on the outer right represents the form 
. 
The forms listed in the previous diagram appear in different 
sets of  bi-descent equations 
bi-descent" : 
for  and ,
the latter bi-descent equations correspond to the following 
 sub-diagrams of the previous diagram: 



































Thus, one clearly sees how the parallelograms representing 
equations 
bi-descent"  
overlap for the various values of  (and a fixed value ) 

finally covering the full triangle in the  plane
which represents the bi-descent equations bi-descent' .
Obviously, this triangle also represents the 
superdescent equations s-descent .
The latter equations presently 
take the same form as the descent equations in   
-dimensional Chern-Simons field theory for which the solution is 
well known, e.g. see reference.  Thus, 
for  , the non-trivial
 solution 
 of the superdescent equations s-descent  is given by
l 
_3^0 =  ( + 2 3  ^3 )  , _2^1 =  (C )  , _1^2 =  ( C C )  , _0^3 =  -1 3   C^3  .
super-D=3 



Some examples of observables 

In this section, we consider the structure group  
to illustrate the conclusions of section . 
For this group, there are two Casimir operators: the  generator 
itself (the charge) and the
quadratic Casimir of . Their degrees are respectively  and
. 

In the sequel, we shall use an index '(a)' for 'abelian'.
The ghosts, connections and curvatures are, respectively,   
given by 
the following superfields and -forms: 





The "canonical" basis s-cohom 
of the cohomology  reads as 
ll 
_1 =  _1(C) = C_(a)  ,
&f_1 = f_1 (_(a)  ) 
= _(a)  _2  = _2(C) = -1 3 C^3 ,
&f_2 = f_2() = ^2 
a-s-coho 
and the canonical descent equations desc-theta  involve the forms
lll 
U(1): &[_1]_0 ^1 =_1 , 
& [_1]_1 ^0 = _(a)  SU(2): &
[_2]_0 ^3 = _2 ,
& [_2]_1 ^2  = (CC) &[_2]_2 ^1 =(C) ,
& [_2]_3 ^0 = (+2 3 ^3) .
a-desc 
Let us now look for the observables that can be 
deduced from the cohomology of 
modulo
 , i.e. from the non-trivial solutions of
the superdescent equations s-descent . We shall consider
three cases, namely the two sets of basic observables corresponding to the 
two Casimir operators, and one set of "composite" observables. 

An example of a solution of the superdescent equations
which does not  yield observables is obtained from the  
bottom superform : this provides 
a simple illustration of the general formalism
where the climbing stops at the form degree equal to the
ghost-number of , namely degree .
 





Solution corresponding to the Casimir of 
 
The superdescent equations for total degree , 




are solved by the superforms 








The latter coincide with the "canonical" 
superforms a-desc  for .

According to 
the results of section 3.3 (see eqs.()()),
the observables are obtained from the superspace exterior derivative
of the top superform  (which has ghost-number zero)
and given by the expansion at :
l 
. _1^0  _
=  . _(a)   _
= F_(a) 
+ ^1w^0 _1  d+ ^2w^0_0  (d)^2
 , 
with  
     F_(a)  = da_(a)   , 
  ^1w^0 _1 =   _(a)  + d_(a) 
 ,   ^2w^0 _0 = _(a) .
abel-observ 
 Apart from the 'trivial' observable , 
the observables are the integrals of the forms 
, 
 on closed submanifolds  and , respectively.  
The polynomials  satisfy Witten's descent equations 
in a general supergauge, i.e. eqs.Witten-Q . 

Equivalently - cf.()-() -
the superspace integral of the superform  
over a collection  
of closed submanifolds
is a direct sum of two integrals,  
 
where the -forms  are the coefficients of the
expansion of .
Each integral in () 
defines an expression belonging to the 
SUSY-constrained cohomology of . These integrals 
coincide with 
those of the forms  defined in abel-observ .

In the WZ-gauge
,
the expressions abel-observ  reduce to the 
Donaldson-Witten polynomials generated from the 
invariant  using the supersymmetry operator
, see eqs.() with . 
In our approach, these polynomials have been 
generated for  from the bottom 
superform  which solves superdescent equations.



Solution corresponding to the Casimir of 
 
The bottom form  has total degree 
and the solution of the superdescent equations
is given by 
the superforms super-D=3 . These expressions coincide with the 
canonical 
superforms a-desc  for .
Applying again proposition 4, we obtain the observables from the
expansion
._3^0 _
= 
. ^2  _
= F_a  ^2 + 
p=0 3  ^4-p   w^0_p  
 (d)^4-p  
 ,
hat-om-3-0 
the last term being an exterior derivative.
By substituting the component field expansions agf aac  
of  into , we obtain the following 
explicit expressions
for the spacetime forms: 
l 
^4w^0 _0 = (^2 + 2^2 ) ^3w^0 _1 =  2 ( + ^2 + 
D_a) 
+ d  ( 2 3  ^3 )  ^2w^0 _2 = (^2 + 2F_a + 2D_a ) 
+  d  (D_a ) ^1w^0 _3 = ( 2 F_a ) 
+d  (2 F_a ) )  .
list-fi2 
 The observables are the integrals of these forms 
 (and of ) 
 on closed submanifolds of appropriate dimension. 

In the WZ-gauge ,
the expressions for the observables again 
reduce to Witten's result (generated from the quadratic 
invariant ), i.e.  
eqs.() with . 




An example of "composite observables" 
As stated at the end of
section , all other
observables are integrals 
whose integrands are polynomials of the forms  
that we constructed in the last two subsections
(i.e. of the forms associated to the Casimir operators). 
Let us illustrate this with the simplest example,
generated by the bottom form  which is of
total degree . The corresponding
top superform is given by 
 and the expansion of its 
superderivative
 = 
yields the following integrands
for the observables: 
l 
^4 w  _0^0 = ( ^2w_0^0 )^2
 =  _(a)  ^2  
^3 w  _1^0 = 2  (^1w_1^0) ( ^2 w_0^0 )  ^2 w _2^0 =  2  ^2w_0^0  F_(a)  + (^1w_1^0)^2 ^1 w _3^0 = 2  ^1w_1^0  F_(a)  ^0 w _4^0 = F_(a) ^2  .
obsII 
Obviously, these forms are polynomials in the
basic forms given in eqs.abel-observ 
and in the abelian curvature invariant  = .










Concluding remarks  
   

We have shown that the problem of determining the equivariant
cohomology of topological Yang-Mills theories can be reduced to that of
computing the Yang-Mills BRST cohomology (modulo ) in the space of
polynomials depending on the components of the
Yang-Mills superconnection , its superghost  and their
exterior derivatives - all these components being superfields. 
The determination of this cohomology relies on different extensions 
of well-known techniques , on one hand to superspace, 
and on the other hand to 
the case where one has two BRST-like operators, namely  and . 
This leads to the consideration of "bi-descent equations"
generalizing the usual descent equations.

Our main result is the following one. Apart from solutions of the  
bi-descent equations
that are trivial in the sense of equivariant cohomology   
(i.e. the trivial observables determined by 
gen-sol-2 ), the general
non-trivial solution gen-sol-1  of these equations 
(describing an observable 
 of dimension  and SUSY-number ) 
is given as the superspace integral 
, where 
 is 
a coefficient of some superform which has total degree , 
this superform being a solution of
a set of "super-descent equations". 
In other words, the observables
are determined by the cohomology of the BRST operator (modulo the
exterior superderivative ) in the space of 
superforms which are polynomials in the
superconnection , the Faddeev-Popov 
ghost-superfield  and their exterior superderivatives.
When specialized to the Wess-Zumino gauge, our result 
reproduces Witten's observables . 
The generalization of our approach to more complex models 
is currently under study and 
will be reported upon elsewhere .

Proofs of some propositions and lemmas 

Proof of Proposition 
.1  



The proof of the results ()() and
()()
is based on the triviality of the cohomologies  and
 for the functional spaces 
 and  , respectively, see propositions 
.1 and .2.
Here, we outline 
the proof of ()(),
the one of  ()() being analogous.

Equation lemma1b   
follows from the cocycle 
condition lemma1a  by virtue of a corollary of 
theorem 9.2 of ref. .  
In the present context, this corollary states that, if the
cohomologies  and  are both trivial, and if a form
 is  -invariant modulo  (i.e. condition
lemma1a  holds), then   is -exact modulo ,
i.e. lemma1b  holds. The same corollary, with the roles of 
and  interchanged, implies that  is -exact
modulo , i.e.  
^s+1   _p-1  = d^s+1   _p-2   +  Q^s   _p-1    .
lemma1c 
By substituting the expressions lemma1b  and  lemma1c 
into lemma1a ,
we obtain the equation



which, due to the triviality of the cohomology , implies 




 This  modulo  invariance condition is solved by  




Introducing this result into eq.lemma1c  and defining



finally yields the result lemma1b' .




	

Proof of Lemma 1  

The proof proceeds by induction.
Equation th-deriv  already holds at form degree .
Let us assume relation th-deriv 
to be true at form degree 
and show its validity at degree .  
By applying  to the 
descent equation desc-s-d  at degree  and using the 
induction hypothesis, we find 



Due to the triviality of the -cohomology, 
this equation implies 
the  modulo  cocycle condition



According to Proposition .1, 
the general solution of the latter is




Discarding the derivative term since it does not contribute to the 
descent
equation desc-s-d  at degree , 
we thus obtain the 
result th-deriv  after replacing 
the spacetime form
 by a   
superfield form 
 
thanks to the 
argument leading from Q-omega 
to Q-superfield .
 

Proof of Proposition 
.3  
   
The first part of the proof was already 
presented after Proposition .3.


In order to 
prove the validity of the bi-descent
equations bi-descent  for all values of 
by induction, 
it is convenient to
use the formalism of "extended forms" . 
The latter involve superfield forms of the same total degree,
but of different form degrees and ghost-numbers.
In general, an extended form  is supposed to be of the 
form 
, but, for the present application, we truncate
the expansion so as to have  as highest form degree, i.e. we
consider
^s-1-r _d+r  = p=0 d  ^s-1-r _p ^d-p+r ( r=0,, s -1  ) .
ext-forms 
The "extended differential" acting on these extended forms is
defined by
ext-d  
and it is nilpotent .

The set of bi-descent equations bi-descent  may then be rewritten 
in terms of extended forms as
^s-r-1 _d+r  + Q ^s-r-2 _d+r+1  
= d ^s-r-1 ^r_d  
( r=0,,s-1 )
 , 
ext-eq 
where the -form on 
the right-hand side cancels the spurious 
-form which is present on the left-hand side.

Knowing that ext-eq  is true for  (i.e. eq.bi-desc-0 )
and assuming that it holds for , let us prove it for
. 
Application of the nilpotent operator   to ext-eq 
yields 





We now use the -form component of equation ext-eq ,  
which is nothing but the 
bi-descent equation bi-descent  for  
and a fixed index , to get 




Due to the triviality of the -cohomology, this relation implies the
existence of an extended form 
and thus leads to equation ext-eq  with .






Proof of Proposition 
.4    
Since we are 
specifically interested in solving, for some 
fixed values of   and  , 
the bi-descent equations bi-descent"  
which correspond to the parallelogram
 defined thereafter, 
we have  to restrict the functional space to that of superfield forms 
having SUSY-number  and form degree  constrained by  
s D-d ,p d . 
cond-trunc 
Thus, we introduce truncated  -superforms  
(more simply referred to as truncated forms  in the following)
of ghost-number :
^g_q = ^g_q^p=q-D+d d  
^q-p ^g_p  (d)^q-p   .
tr-s-forms 
Here, the coefficients  are superfield forms.
In the special case where , 
the truncated form tr-s-forms 
contains superfield forms of ghost-number  belonging to the 
parallelogram .
Depending on the relative values of ,  and , the
expansion  tr-s-forms  may involve terms of negative
SUSY-number or negative form degree, but all of these terms vanish by
virtue of our conventions.

Moreover, we define 
the (nilpotent) truncated differential   
which has the property of mapping truncated forms to truncated forms:
=  ^ ,
tr-diff 
We note that the arguments in brackets in the definitions 
tr-s-forms tr-diff 
are superforms. Truncation simply means cutting down all of 
their components which do not satisfy the condition
cond-trunc .

The space of truncated forms 
for the fixed pair  will be denoted by .
It is generated by the basic superfield forms 
and the action of the 
operators ,  and , the latter operator 
giving rise to the expressions 



 
The obvious relations 
c 
 ^= ^^= ()^ ,
trunc-form 
which hold for arbitrary truncated superforms  and , 
show that the projection from the algebra of superforms 
to the algebra of truncated superforms represents an 
homomorphism. 

In terms of truncated superforms, the bi-descent equations 
for the pair , i.e. eqs.bi-descent" , 
read as 
^g_D-g  + ^g+1 _D-g-1 =0
(  g=0,,D  )  .
tr-s-descent 
These truncated superdescent equations  define
the cohomology  of  modulo  
in the functional space . 
This cohomological problem can 
be solved using the algebraic techniques of reference .

Thus, as before, we do not fix the form degree 
and we assume that 
the forms of negative form degree,
ghost-number or SUSY-number vanish. 
The first step  consists of determining the cohomology 
 in the functional space   
of superfield forms  
introduced in funct-spaces 
(and subsequently in the functional space ).
In this respect, it is convenient to consider 
the superfield variables 
, , , , ,  
 where ,  and  have been 
 defined in eqs.s-field-red .
By virtue of the BRST transformations 
BRS-redef , the fields 
 and  form a BRST doublet and
therefore they are absent from the 
cohomology . 
The remaining fields consist of the 
gauge superfield form  and its ghost , as well as the 
two "matter superfields"  and .
From this fact, we
conclude  that the cohomology  
is algebraically
generated by the invariant polynomials 
depending on , the supercurvature  and  
the matter superfields 
- all of which fields transform covariantly -
as well as 
their covariant exterior derivatives. More precisely, 
the cohomology  in the space 
  is generated by the cocycles
_r(C)( r=1,, rank  G  )and  
P^inv (F_A , , , D_A ,
D_A )
 ,
s-cohom-AA 
where  is the cocycle 
s-cohom  associated to the  Casimir
operator of the structure group  and where  
is any invariant polynomial of its arguments. 
A straightforward generalization 
of this result from superfield forms to truncated 
superforms yields the following lemma.

 []
Lemma .1  
The cohomology  in the functional space  is given by the
truncated forms whose non-vanishing coefficients are polynomials
in the superfield forms given in s-cohom-AA .


Let us now determine the cohomology 
in the space  by 
starting from the 
bottom equation of tr-s-descent , i.e. the equation
for : .
According to lemma .1,
the general non-trivial solution of  the latter 
equation is given by a 
truncated superform  
which is a polynomial in the 's.
However, just as in the case  
of complete superform solutions discussed 
in section , only a linear term 
in  allows us to work our way up 
to ghost-number zero, i.e. to construct observables. 
Therefore, we assume that  =  for
some value of . The total degree  will then be odd and given by 
D=g_r = 2m_r-1 ,
D=g_r 
where  is the degree of the  Casimir operator.

The form  generates 
a special  solution of the truncated superdescent equations 
tr-s-descent ,
namely the truncation to the
parallelogram  of the superforms
 ()
obeying the superdescent equations
desc-theta .  
For the top form, this yields




The general  solution corresponding to the same 
bottom form
 is obtained by adding to it the general solution of the
truncated superdescent equations beginning with . 
Since we
are only interested in cohomology classes, we shall consider the
slightly more general, though equivalent form
^D_0 = ^D-1 _0 ,
initial-Omega 
where  is a truncated  -superform 
of ghost-number .
Solving this problem for a value
of  which is not necessarily equal to  as in D=g_r  will 
give us the general solution of  tr-s-descent 
corresponding to a bottom form  
which  is vanishing or trivial in the sense of
eq.initial-Omega . 

The procedure is iterative. 
Let us assume that we have arrived, at the stage of ghost-number , 
to the trivial solution 




for some truncated superforms  and
.
By inserting this expression into the descent
equation tr-s-descent  for ghost-number  and using the nilpotency of ,
we obtain 


 
From  lemma .1, it follows that the 
solution of this relation is given by 
^g _D-g  = ^g-1 _D-g  
+ ^g _D-g-1 
+ ^g  _D-g    ,
sol-level-g 
where the truncated superform  
belongs to the cohomology  as given by lemma 
.1,
if there exists a representative of the latter 
with the right ghost-number and form degree.
The supercocycle 
has to satisfy a consistency condition 
ensuring that the next descent equation 
in tr-s-descent  is integrable. 
Indeed, let us substitute sol-level-g 
into the descent equation for ghost-number , thus obtaining
^g-1  _D-g+1  - ^g-1  _D-g  
+ ^g_D-g  = 0 .
eq-level(g-1) 
In order for this equation to admit a solution , 
there must exist a truncated superform  such that
^g-1  _D-g+1   +  ^g _D-g  = 0  .
consist-HH  
Then, the solution of eq-level(g-1)  is given by 
^g-1  _D-g+1  
= ^g-2  _D-g+1  
+ ^g-1  _D-g 
+ ^g-1  _D-g+1  + ^g-1  _D-g+1   
 ,
sol-level(g-1) 
where  is again an element of
 
which, in turn, has to obey a consistency condition like
consist-HH .

Discarding for the moment all of the supercocycles  which 
have appeared or may still appear
during this process, we finally arrive, at
ghost-number zero, to the trivial solution



which, according to 
definition tr-s-forms , reads explicitly as
^D-d ^0_d = d ^D-d ^0_d-1  + Q ^D-d-1 ^0_d    .
sol-level-0 
 By virtue of  equation obs-d-s ,
this solution corresponds to a vanishing observable: 
. 

Let us now go back to one of the steps where a cohomological term 
 appears. 
 Since this term belongs to 
 the cohomology , it is
a polynomial in the cocycles s-cohom-AA  - again to be taken as 
(at most) linear in the . Thus, we 
consider a generic term of one of the two following forms, 
which generalizes the
superform expression s-d-cohom : 
^0 _D  = 
 _D ^0(F_A , , , D_A , D_A ) 
HH-0 
or 
^g_r_1  _D-g_r_1   
= _r_1 (C)  _D-g_r_1  ^0
(F_A , , , D_A , D_A )  .
HH-G  
Here,  denotes 
the cocycle s-cohom  of ghost-number , while 
the truncated superforms  and 
 are invariant polynomials of their arguments.

Let us begin with the solution HH-0  which may
be encountered in the last step of the 
process described above, namely at ghost-number zero. 
In this case, 
the coefficient  of the truncated form 

is a BRST invariant polynomial in the superfield
forms , ,  and their covariant derivatives as in
equation s-cohom-AA .
By virtue of sol-level-g   
with , the expression 
 solves the truncated superdescent equations 
tr-s-descent . 
This solution is 
cohomologically non-trivial if 
^D-d ^0_d d ^D-d  _d-1 ^0 + Q  ^D-d-1 _d ^0 
 .
OM-eq-triv 
This result 
yields the second class of solutions
announced in proposition .4, 
i.e. the one given in equation gen-sol-2 .

 
Next, we turn 
to the case given by the solution HH-G ,
which case may be encountered at a ghost-number .
We now have to solve the consistency condition consist-HH .
We recall that the cocycle  
generates a set of (complete) superforms 
 ()
obeying the superdescent equations desc-theta .
Substituting the expression HH-G  into
consist-HH  and using the superdescent equation desc-theta  
for the ghost cocycle 
, we obtain 
the following relation with the help
of the properties trunc-form : 
^g_r_1 -1  _D-g_r_1 +1 
 -  
_r_1  
^g_r_1 -1 _1 ^0_D-g_r_1   ^ +  
(-1)^g_r_1    _r_1  (C)  ^0_D- g_r_1   
= 0  . 
xzzs 
Here, the exponent 'tr' of the second term means
truncation  according to the definition tr-s-forms .
The last term 
in xzzs  is a non-trivial -cohomology class,  
whereas the first two terms are -exact.
 Therefore, both 
expressions must vanish separately. This implies the following 
consistency condition  for :
^0_D-g_r_1   = 0  .
P-consistency 
Assuming this relation to hold, condition xzzs  can now 
be solved by 
^g_r_1 -1 _D-g_r_1 +1  = 
_r_1  
_1^g_r_1 -1  ^0_D-g_r_1   ^ ,
sol-H-first 
where we discarded possible -exact terms as well as 
terms belonging to  which, for their part, 
would generate further solutions.
As a matter of fact, the solution sol-H-first  is the first 
of a chain of truncated supercocycles
^g_D-g  
1 ^g _g_r_1 -g  ^0_D-g_r_1   ^
( g=0,,g_r_1 -1   )  , 
sol-H-gen 
which obey the following truncated superdescent 
equations by virtue of
eqs.desc-theta  and P-consistency : 
^g_D-g  + ^g+1 _D-g-1  =0 (  g 
=0,,g_r_1 -1  ) .
H-desc-eq 

We still have to solve condition P-consistency . 
This requires the determination of the 
cohomology  in the space , the
result being expressed by the following lemma:

 [] 
Lemma  .2  
The cohomology  in the space  is given by the truncated
superforms of ghost-number  and total degree :
^0_D = 
^D-d ^0_d  ( d)^D-d  
 .
cohom-trd  
Here, 
 is a BRST invariant polynomial in the superfield
forms , ,  and their covariant derivatives as in
eq.s-cohom-AA , of degree  and ghost-number ,
but subject to the non-triviality condition





where the superfield forms  and 

 are the components of a truncated superform
belonging to .
In particular,    
the cohomology  is trivial for truncated superforms of
degree strictly      
smaller than .

Proof:  
In this proof, we do not specify the ghost-number which is
irrelevant for the present discussion.
We have to solve the equation 
for the truncated form tr-s-forms .
Let us begin with the generic case, i.e. .
The condition  can then  
be written as a set of equations, one for each
form degree: 
Q ^q-p-1 _p+1  + d ^q-p _p  = 0
(  p=q-D+d,,d-1  )  . 
tr2 
The first of these equations, namely the one for , may be solved 
by using proposition .1 
(see lemma1a -L1b' ), which yields
l 
^D-d _q-D+d  = Q ^D-d-1 _q-D+d  
+ d ^D-d _q-D+d-1   ^D-d-1 _q-D+d+1  = Q ^D-d-2 _q-D+d+1  
+ d ^D-d-1 _q-D+d    .
trr1 
Substituting this result into the second equation of the set
tr2 , we get



whose solution, due to the triviality of , is given by 
^D-d-2 _q-D+d+2  = Q ^D-d-3 _q-D+d+2  
+ d ^D-d-2 _q-D+d+1    .
trr2 
The procedure continues along these line until
the solution of the last equation of the set tr2 :
^q-d _d  = Q ^q-d-1 _d  
+ d ^q-d _d-1    .
trrr2 
By combining these results, we conclude that, for , we have  
_q= _q-1  , 
with    
_q-1  = p=q-D+d-1 d  ^q-1-p _p
 (d)^q-1-p   ,
tr3 
i.e. the general solution is trivial.
Thus, we are left with the case , 
i.e. the cocycle condition , 
which is identically satisfied, whence the result
cohom-trd . 



Let us now solve equation P-consistency  with the help of this
lemma. 
Since , it follows from lemma .2  
that the solution  
of P-consistency  is a -variation, i.e.
. 
Thereby, equation sol-H-gen  for  can be written as
^0 _D  
= 1 ^0_g_r_1    ^0_D-g_r_1 -1  ^ .
HH-G-1 
Since  is -invariant, the polynomial 
 again 
has to be a solution of a system of
truncated superdescent equations in the functional space :
l 
^g _D-g_r_1 -g-1  + 
^g+1 _D-g_r_1 -g-2  = 0 (g= 0,, D-g_r_1 -1)  .
tr-desc-2 
These are solved in the same way
as we did in the first step above(However, there is a
difference here:  since the total degree is less than   and the
truncation is made relative to the pair , the parallelogram
is replaced by a pentagram  defined by the lines 



) . 
The non-trivial solution of the bottom equation 
is a supercocycle 
^g_r_2  _0  = _r_2 (C)
with    g_r_2  D-g_r_1 -1  ,
bottom-2 
if any such exists with this
ghost-number. Otherwise   0 and one has to climb
up equations tr-desc-2  until meeting a non-trivial cohomology
- as we did in the first step - and then continue, 
starting from this cohomology. But let us
consider the case where bottom-2  holds. Then, 
we get the following result by using desc-theta  and by 
discarding possible new cohomology 
that may appear in the process of climbing up:  




Substitution of this expression into HH-G-1 
and application of the rules tr-diff -trunc-form  then yields 
^0 _D  
= 1 ^0_g_r_1   2 ^0_g_r_2   ^= 1 ^0_g_r_1   f_r_2 () ^ ,
with g_r_1 + g_r_2  +1=D ,
HH-G-2 
where we have used the last of equations desc-theta .

Going back to the previous step where new cohomology might have been
encountered, we may repeat the whole argument, producing in this way
solutions involving more and more factors 
 = . Thus, the 
 generic solution of the truncated superdescent 
equations reads as 

where 
^0 _D  = 1 ^0_g_r_1   f_r_2 () f_r_L ()  ^ ,with k=1 L  g_r_k  + L -1=D(L1)  .
HH-G-L 
This conclusion is precisely the result 
gen-sol-1  stated in proposition 
.4.
