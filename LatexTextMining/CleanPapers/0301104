Abstract 


A systematic construction is presented of 1/4 BPS operators in
 superconformal Yang-Mills theory, using either analytic
superspace methods or components. In the construction, the
operators of the classical theory annihilated by 4 out of 16
supercharges are arranged into two types. The first type consists
of those operators that contain 1/4 BPS operators in the full
quantum theory. The second type consists of descendants of
operators in long unprotected multiplets which develop anomalous
dimensions in the quantum theory. The 1/4 BPS operators of the
quantum theory are defined to be orthogonal to all the descendant
operators with the same classical quantum numbers. It is shown, to
order , that these 1/4 BPS operators have protected
dimensions.









 




Introduction 



There are few things one can calculate exactly in the
four-dimensional superconformal Yang-Mills theories. One class of
such quantities consists of a set of correlation functions of the
Bogomolnyi Prasad Sommerfield (BPS) operators. In 
superconformal Yang-Mills, there are 1/2 BPS, 1/4 BPS and 1/8 BPS
operators, which are operators that are invariant under 8, 4 and 2
(out of 16) Poincare supercharges respectively. Based on very
general arguments involving only the supersymmetry algebra
, the anomalous dimension of any of
these operators vanishes identically in the full quantum theory.

In the AdS/CFT correspondence, the local gauge invariant operators of
 superconformal Yang-Mills are mapped to the physical
states of the Type IIB superstring on AdSS. (See
 for the original papers and
 for reviews.) The single trace
1/2 BPS operators (also referred to as chiral primary operators or
CPOs) play a special role as they are in one-to-one correspondence
with the short multiplets of supergravity and Kaluza-Klein states
with spins . Driven by the success of this correspondence,
several authors have derived non-renormalization results for
various correlation functions of these operators. Results on the
perturbative non-renormalisation of 2- and 3-point functions were
derived in in components and in superspace in
; for further references on 3-point computations
see. An argument for the complete
non-renormalisation of the 3-point function of the supercurrent
multiplet based on anomalies was given in and a
superspace version of this was presented in. An
argument for the (non-perturbative) non-renormalisation of all 2-
and 3-point functions of BPS operators based on an extra 
symmetry was given in and this was verified using
analytic superspace methods in following on from  the
earlier work of. Generalizations to -point functions
were obtained for extremal and
near-extremal correlators
.

Other BPS operators are also important, both from the perspective
of superconformal Yang-Mills theory, and from that of the AdS/CFT
correspondence. The simplest generalization is to multi-trace 1/2
BPS operators, for which non-renormalization results
are the same as for single trace 1/2 BPS operators; see also
. Indeed, the arguments of andapply in this case too.



A more delicate generalization is to the multi-trace scalar
operators obeying a 1/4 BPS shortening rule. A general group
theoretic classification of such operators in free field theory
was amongst the results derived in. A more detailed
study carried out in revealed that in the
full quantum interacting theory, the true 1/4 BPS operators
involve admixtures of classical 1/4 BPS operators ofwith descendants of non-BPS operators that occur in long
supersymmetry multiplets. Using the operators obtained in
, 2- and 3-point functions involving 1/2 and
1/4 BPS operators were computed in. In all cases
studied, these correlators were shown to be non-renormalized to
order  as well as to be in accord with their large , large
 limit accessible through the AdS/CFT correspondence. In the
framework of analytic superspace it turns out that the 1/4 BPS
operators are described as tensor superfields carrying
superindices. In the 2- and 3-point functions of 1/4 BPS
operators were analysed in analytic superspace and shown to be
non-renormalised in a similar fashion to correlators of 1/2 BPS
operators. (In fact, this result can be extended to many
protected operators, including those which are in shortened series
A representations.)  Correlation functions with 
operators are, in general, expected to receive quantum
corrections, just as the multipoint functions of 1/2 BPS operators
do. (See also for further
references.)

However, an important puzzle arose in. It was
argued that the number of 1/4 BPS operators in the interacting
quantum theory for some representations was smaller than one would
have expected from counting the number of 1/4 BPS operators in the
classical theory. This would have required the presence of some
form of superconformal anomaly, which is not expected to be
present. Also, the procedure for constructing the candidate
operators used in was somewhat ad hoc and
difficult to generalize.

In this note we use the machinery of (4,1,1) harmonic superspace
to describe 1/4 BPS operators. The use of extended supersymmetry
dramatically simplifies the counting and construction of scalar
composite operators in the  representations of the
R-symmetry group . We find that some operators were
overlooked in. Taking these operators into
account eliminates the mismatch between the number of 1/4 BPS
operators in the free and the interacting theory.



The construction of all 1/4 BPS operators in the fully interacting
quantum theory is carried out as follows. First, in the classical
interacting theory, a basis is produced of all the scalar
operators in the representations of the R-symmetry group 
suitable for 1/4 BPS operators with Dynkin labels ,
 and with classical dimension . In the classical
interacting theory there are natural candidates for 1/4 BPS
operators as well as other operators which can be identified as
descendants. The basis may be regrouped into operators of these
two types. Harmonic superspace techniques reduce this construction
down to elementary group theory. The (4,1,1) superspace notation
also makes distinguishing candidate 1/4 BPS operators from
descendant operators simple.

Already at the Born level, the two types of operators usually mix;
the overlaps between descendants and candidate BPS operators are
generally nonzero. In a given representation  of ,
we identify the 1/4 BPS operators as those linear combinations of
candidate 1/4 BPS operators and descendants which at Born level
are orthogonal to all descendant operators in the same
representation of . By construction therefore, the
admixture coefficients depend on  but not on the coupling
. A scalar composite operator in the  of 
which is annihilated by 4 out of 16 (Poincare) supercharges can
be either -descendants of long operators
or 1/4-BPS primaries.
(
    It was shown in that
    these are the only possibilities by group theory.
)  Thus, we argue that after subtracting off all the descendant
pieces we should be left with a protected operator. We then
proceed to calculate the two-point functions involving the 1/4 BPS
operators thus constructed. Remarkably, even though the
renormalization of long operators is governed by interactions, our
1/4 BPS operators constructed using Born level two-point functions
remain orthogonal to all the (descendants of) long operators at
order . We find that any two point function involving a 1/4
BPS operator constructed this way receives no order 
corrections.

In the following  we first review the 1/4 BPS operators from the
point of view of harmonic superspace and then discuss the
diagonalization of the operators corresponding to the same
representations that were discussed in.




 SYM in harmonic superspace 



The leading component fields of the 1/4 BPS multiplets in 
SCFT are given by scalar fields which transform under the internal
symmetry group   in representations with Dynkin labels of
the form  . The complete supermultiplets can be very
simply described in harmonic superspace, and we briefly recall how
this construction works.

For  extended supersymmetry in four dimensions, 
 harmonic superspace is obtained from ordinary
Minkowski superspace  by the adjunction of a compact manifold
of the form  where 
. This construction
allows one to construct p projections of the  supercovariant
derivatives  and q projections of their conjugates 
 which mutually anticommute.  We can therefore define
generalized chiral or G-analytic superfields (G for Grassmann) in
such superspaces which are annihilated by these derivatives. Now
the superfields in harmonic superspace will also depend on the
coordinates of , and as this space is a complex manifold, they
can be analytic in the usual sense (H-analytic) in their
dependence on these coordinates.  As the internal manifold is
compact H-analytic fields will have finite harmonic expansions.
The Lorentz scalar superfields which are both G-analytic and
H-analytic,  which we shall refer to as analytic, are the fields
we are interested in. They can be shown to carry short irreducible
unitary representations of the superconformal group (provided that
they transform under irreducible representations of ). For
original papers and detailed accounts of harmonic and analytic
superspaces, see for example
.


(4,1,1) Harmonic Superspace 

For the 1/4 BPS operators in  the most appropriate harmonic
superspace has . Since the analytic
fields in this space will be annihilated by one  and one 
 it follows that they will only depend at most on  of the
odd coordinates of .  Instead of working directly on the coset
defined by the isotropy group  we shall
follow the standard practice of working on the group  which
amounts to the same thing provided that all the fields have their
dependence on  fixed. We denote an element of  by
 and its inverse by . The group  is
taken to act on the capital index  which we decompose as
, while  acts on the small
indices . Using  and its inverse we can convert
 indices into  indices and vice versa. Thus we can
define

lll  D_I & u_I ^i D_i &=(D_1 ,D_r , D_4 )
 

&&

 D_ ^I& D_ ^i (u^-1 )_i ^I&= (D_ ^1, D_ ^r, D_ ^4)
 
Clearly, we have . To
differentiate in the coset space directions we use the
right-invariant vector fields on  which we denote by
,  and which satisfy  and
.  These derivatives obey the Lie algebra relations of
 and act on  by

D_I ^J u_K ^k= _K ^J u_I ^k -_I ^J u_K ^k 
The basic differential operators on  can be divided into
three sets: the derivatives 
correspond to the isotropy group, the derivatives 
 can be thought of as essentially the components
of the  operator on  and the derivatives 
 are the complex conjugates of these. Note that
the derivatives  commute with 
 and . G-analytic fields are annihilated by
 and , H-analytic fields are
annihilated by  and analytic fields
are annihilated by both of these sets of operators.

The  Yang-Mills theory is described in Minkowski superspace
by a scalar superfield  which transforms under the
six-dimensional representation of  and also under the
adjoint representation of the gauge group which we take to be
. It is real in the sense that 
. This superfield satisfies the constraints

_i  W_jk &=&_ijkl  _  ^l


_ ^i W_jk &=& 2^i_[j _k]  
where  is a superfield whose leading component is the spinor
field of the multiplet.and where  is a spinorial
derivative which is covariant with respect to the gauge group.
Using the superspace Bianchi identities one can easily show that
the only other independent spacetime component of  is the
spacetime Yang-Mills field strength and that all of the component
fields satisfy their equations of motion.

In  superspace we can define the superfield 
. Using the properties outlined above one
can easily show that

_1  W_1r =_ ^4 W_1r =0

and that the derivatives    all
annihilate , so that  is a covariantly analytic
field on  harmonic superspace.  However, if we consider
gauge-invariant products of 's, i.e. traces or multi-traces,
the resulting objects will be analytic superfields; they will be
annihilated by  and  rather than the
gauge-covariant versions. These are the superfields which we shall
use to construct the 1/4 BPS states. To make the formulae less
cluttered we shall abbreviate
(
    So the index  takes the values  for ,
    and  for .
    ) 
 to  and define
.

Quarter BPS Operators 

These superfields are easy to describe. The superfield
corresponding to the representation  contains 
powers of  in the representation  of  (this is the
 in the isotropy group), i.e. it has  symmetrized
 indices. If  the single trace operators are the
chiral primaries which are 1/2 BPS. These operators we will refer
to as CPOs and denote by ,

A_r_1r_p (W_(r_1 W_r_p) ) 
The lowest CPO is the stress-tensor multiplet . We
can obtain further 1/2 BPS operators by taking products of CPOs
and  symmetrizing on all of the  indices. The 1/4 BPS
operators (for ) fall into two classes. There are operators
that can be constructed as products of the CPOs with at least one
pair of contracted indices, for example T_rs  T^rs  ,A_rst  A^st  ,A_rst  A^t _uvw  ,and so on. 
These operators have no commutators in their definition, and
so are the candidate 1/4 BPS operators, up to subtleties which we
shall come to in due course. Operators in the other class have at
least one single-trace factor in which the indices of two or more
pairs of 's are contracted, as in W^2 W^2 ,A_rst   W^2 W^2 ,W_r W_s W^2 W^2 ,etc.  where
 W^2W_r W^r=^rs  W_r W_s = ^rs  [W_r,W_s]
 
These operators are descendants; the superspace Bianchi identities
imply that

^ _i  _j  W^kl = 2_j ^[k 
[W_im , W^l]m ] 
>From this formula and its conjugate one can see that  can be
written as

  W^2= (_1)^2 W^14 =-(^4)^2 W_14 
  
where ,

 and where 
. Given a product of 's containing a factor of
, therefore, the latter can be written in terms of
derivatives as above and the derivatives can be taken to act on
the whole expression with  replaced by either  or its
conjugate. This follows by G-analyticity. Indeed, if there are two
factors of  in an operator then all four derivatives can be
brought outside. This is because

  _1  W_14 =0and  _ ^4 W^14 =0
  
In fact, the descendant 1/4 BPS operators always have at least two
factors of  so that they can be written explicitly as
derivatives of long operators by these means. However, we are not
quite finished yet because the ancestor operators will not be
H-analytic on  harmonic superspace as they stand. This
can be remedied by noting that

(_1)^2(^4)^2 W^1r =[W^2,W^r]

with the aid of which we can write, for example,  as

  (W^2W^2)&=&-13 (_1)^2(^4)^2 ( (W_14 W^14 )+(W_1r W^1r ))

&=&-112  (_1)^2(^4)^2 (W_ij W^ij )

&=&-112  (D_1)^2(D^4)^2 (W_ij W^ij ) 
where , and 
. Hence we see that
 is a descendant of the Konishi operator
. In general, one can use
(), (),
() and () to find
 12  (_1)^2(^4)^2
 W_ij  A W^ij 
=
W_r A [W^2, W^r] + [W^2, W^r] A W_r - 2 W^2 A W^2
provided  involves only the .
And since we are dealing with gauge invariant operators,
we can replace the  by .

We note for future use that each of the descendants that we
consider below can be written as an ancestor superfield acted on
by the differential operator .

On the other hand, the CPOs themselves cannot be obtained by
differentiation from other operators and so the candidate 1/4 BPS
operators cannot be (entirely) descendants. An operator
annihilated by  and  can be either a
 descendant of a long primary; or a
 or  descendant of a 1/8 BPS primary;
or a 1/4 BPS primary. In it was shown that a
 scalar composite operator can not be a descendant of a
1/8 BPS primary. Therefore, we argue that after subtracting off
all the descendant pieces from candidate BPS operators, we should
be left with a 1/4 BPS primary; it simply can not be anything
else!



Examples of systematic description 

We begin by outlining a few rules that determine which tensor
structures are permitted.


First we observe that, since contractions are made using the
antisymmetric tensor  while the tensors 
are symmetric, contractions within the same  give zero,
 
so we can only contract indices in different 's.


Next, consider . Since  transforms under the
3-dimensional representation of  it follows that the
product of two s will decompose into the five and
one-dimensional representations. The former corresponds to
symmetrisation on all four indices, i.e. , while
for a single contraction we have
   T_r t  T_s ^t=-T_s t  T_r ^t=_rs T_uv T^uv 
 Similarly, the product of three s contains only the seven-and
three-dimensional representations, so that, for example
   T_r ^s T_s ^t T_t ^r=0
 One can look at contractions of other 's in a similar fashion.
For example,  contains only the seven- and
three-dimensional representations of  corresponding to
tensors obtained by symmetrising on six or two indices with zero
or two contractions respectively. So
   A^rst  A_rst =A_(rs  ^v A_tu)v =0
 while
  A_r  ^tu A_s tu =A_s  ^tu A_r tu 
 or, equivalently,
 


These equations  generalise in a straightforward manner. Whenever
we contract an odd number of indices in two s of the same
length and symmetrize on the
remaining indices, the resulting tensor vanishes.
(
    In general there will be more than one nonvanishing structure.
    For instance, both
     and
    
    are independent nonvanishing tensors.
)  If s of different length are contracted (as in 
), there is no such restriction.


We shall now discuss some explicit examples. We shall use the
convention that uncontracted  indices are understood to be
totally symmetrized.

The Representation  

Such operators have to have  's and only one
contraction. There are no single trace operators in this class
because

  (W_r_1 W_r_p W^2)=0
 
Hence these operators can only be constructed by contracting CPOs.
They are all protected. This can also be seen from representation
theory because there are no long representations which contain
these representations. This result also shows
that any single-trace factor in an operator must have at least two
contractions.


Here we list the lowest dimensional examples of 
representations (for ). For [1,1,1] and [1,2,1] we can
not construct any nonvanishing tensors of this form. For [1,3,1],
there is one possible operator,
   &=& A_rst  T^t  _u 
 Similarly, for [1,4,1] the only possible operator is
   &=& A_rstu  T^u  _v 
 Higher representations offer more choices, and already in the
[1,5,1] we find
   _1&=& A_rstuv  T^v  _w 


 _2&=& A_rstv  A^v  _uw 


 _3&=& T_rs  T_tv  A^v  _uw 
 All of these operators have protected two-point functions, as we
will explicitly verify in Section .




The Representation [2,0,2] 

This operator is realized as an  scalar in 
harmonic superspace. There are just two possibilities
   _1&=& T_rs  T^rs 


 _2 &=& (W^2 W^2)
 Using the rules outlined in the beginning of Section
, we see that  is the
only multiple trace operator one can construct with two pairs of
contracted indices, and there is also no other choice for the
single trace operator but .  is a candidate 1/4 BPS
operator while  is a descendant; as seen in
(), it is a descendant of the Konishi
operator.

The Representation [2,1,2] 

This has 5 fields and forms an  doublet. There are again
only two possibilities
  _1&=& A_rst  T^st 


 _2&=& (W_r W^2 W^2)
 This case is completely parallel to the [2,0,2] representation.

The operator  can be written in the form
 
 
 _2=-116  (D_1)^2(D^4)^2 (W_r W_ij  W^ij )
  
Note that the ancestor here is defined on (4,1,1) harmonic
superspace; it is not G-analytic but it is H-analytic. One can
easily remove the harmonic variables to obtain the corresponding
superfield on ordinary superspace. In this case it is
.

The Representation [2,2,2] 

This has 6 fields and transforms as a triplet under .
Multiple trace operators are constructed in the following way. We
can partition the set of six fields as 6 = 4 + 2, 6 = 3 + 3, or 6
= 2 + 2 + 2. Two pairs of indices are contracted, and two
remaining indices are symmetrized. The possibilities are
   _1&=& A_rstu  T^tu 


 _2&=& A_r  ^tu  A_stu 


 _3&=& T_rs  T_tu  T^tu 


 _4&=& (W_r W_s W^2 W^2)


 _5&=& (W_r W^2 W_s W^2)


 _6&=& (W^2 W^2) T_rs 
 The first three are candidate 1/4 BPS operators while the last
three are descendants. For the partitions 6 = 4 + 2 and 6 = 3 + 3,
these are the only choices because contractions within the same
 give zero. For the partition 6 = 2 + 2 + 2, equation
() relates any other triple-trace [2,2,2]
operator to .

The operator  is a descendant of the product of the Konishi
operator and the supercurrent, while  and  are
descendants of the operators
 
  _1&=&(W_r W_s W_ij W^ij )
 

 _2&=&(W_r W_ij  W_sW^ij )
  
A short calculation yields
 
 
 _4&=&140 (D_1)^2(D^4)^2(_2-3 _1)
 


 _5&=&120 (D_1)^2(D^4)^2(_1- 2 _2)
  
In terms of ordinary superfields, both  and  are in
the  representation of .

The Representation [2,3,2] 

The possibilities are
   _1&=& A_rstuv  T^uv 


 _2&=& A_rs  ^uv  A_tuv 


 _3&=& A_rst  T_uv  T^uv 


 _4&=& A_r ^uv  (T^2)_stuv 


 _5&=& (W_r W_s W_t W^2 W^2)


 _6&=& (W_r W_s W^2 W_t W^2)


 _7&=& T_rs (W_t W^2 W^2)


 _8&=& A_rst (W^2W^2)
 The first four are candidate 1/4 BPS operators while the second
four are descendants.

The last of these is a descendant of a product of 
and the Konishi operator, while the ancestor of  is a
product of  and . For the other two
descendants we have
 
 
 _5&=&124 (D_1)^2(D^4)^2(_2-2_1)
 


 _6&=&124 (D_1)^2(D^4)^2(_1-2_2)
  
where
 
  _1&=&(W_rW_sW_t W_ij W^ij )
 

 _2&=&(W_rW_s W_ij W_tW^ij )
  

The Representation [3,0,3] 

There is only one possibility: &=& (W^2 W^2 W^2) This operator is a descendant. There are no candidate 1/4 BPS
operators in this case. As we saw in () and
(), the operators  and
 vanish identically. Explicitly, this
operator can be written as
 
 
 18 (D_1)^2(D^4)^2(W^2 W_ij W^ij )
  




The Representation [3,1,3] 

This example again has seven fields but the representation of
 is the doublet. The operators are
   _1&=& A_r ^stu  A_stu 


 _2&=& (T^2)_rstu  A^stu 


 _3&=& (W_r W^2 W^2 W^2)


 _4&=& (W_r W^2 W_s W^2 W^s - W_r W_s W^2 W^s W^2)


 _5&=& T_r ^s (W_s W^2 W^2)
 so there are 3 descendants in this case. We have symmetrized
 so that . This symmetry
amounts to charge conjugation on the fields  in the adjoint
representation of the gauge group and the  of .
Its effect on the  superfield formulation is to map 
.

The last operator is again a descendant of a product of operators
that we have discussed previously. For the other two we have
 
 
 _3&=&130 (D_1)^2(D^4)^2(_2-5_1)
 


 _4&=&16  (D_1)^2(D^4)^2(_1+_2)
  
where
 
  _1&=&(W_r W^2 W_ij W^ij )
 

 _2&=&(W_r W_s W_ij  W^sW^ij )
 Multiplicity of quarter BPS operators 

The (classical) quarter BPS operators in the 
representation are built from single trace quarter (and half) BPS
operators. These have the form  (W_(r_1 W_r_q) 
(W^2)^p) for operators in the  
representation, but the order of the  operators inside the
trace is arbitrary.

To find the number of different single trace operators in this
representation, , consider the reducible operator

X_Q:=(W_r_1 W_r_Q ), 
where the  indices are no longer taken to be symmetrised.
This is in a reducible representation of , and contains all

single trace scalar composite operators of dimension .
So one obtains the number of

operators in each representation by
expanding this operator as a sum of irreducible representations.
For example to find all single trace

operators of dimension 4 consider . This has 6 components
(given by (1111), (1112), (1122), (1212), (2221), (2222)
where 
is short hand for .) In
terms of irreducible  representations it splits as .
In terms of  representations the 5 corresponds to 
and the 1 corresponds to , and so we find that there is
only one operator in each of these two representations.

More generally, to split  into irreducibles, consider the
components of . Let  denote the number of components
of  with  1's and  2's, i.e. the number of ways to
arrange a total of  objects with  of one type and  of
another type up to circular permutations.

Then  splits into the following irreducible representations:
_p=0 ^Q/2   (c(Q,p) - c(Q,p-1)
)  [p,q,p] where  and where 
denotes the largest integer less than or equal to . So the
number of single trace operators in the  representation
is N_pq =c(Q,p)-c(Q,p-1).mult  In general the formula
for  is quite complicated, but in certain cases it
simplifies. For example
c(Q,0)=1
,c(Q,1)=1
,c(Q,2)=Q /2  ,
and if  and  are co-prime
then  N_pq = 1 Q  Q p .
As an example, consider dimension 6 operators:  has 14
components and  is given by:
c(6,0)=c(6,1)=1
,c(6,2)=3
,c(6,3)=4.
Then mult  gives
N_06 =1
,N_14 =0
,N_22  = 2
,N_30 =1
,
reproducing the
correct numbers of single-trace operators discussed above (in
particular there are two operators in the  representation
and 1 in the .)

Since multiple trace operators can be obtained by multiplying
together single trace operators, to find the number of multi-trace
operators in a given representation one just has to consider all
possible ways of obtaining the representation in question from
tensor products of other representations and use the formula for
single-trace operators.


Relationship between  and  superfields 

The map between quarter BPS operators in the  formalism and
those in  analytic superspace is straightforward. In the
 formalism the quarter BPS operators are given by

[ (z^2c )^p (z_d)^q ] 
where  denote gauge invariant combinations,
 and 
. Here the  are  indices.
These operators have highest weight state given by

[ (z_1  z_2 -z_2  z_1  )^p (z_1)^q ]. 
In  harmonic superspace on the other hand, this object is
given by

[ (W^2)^p  (W_r)^q  ]. 
If we relabel the  indices  then this
operator has highest weight state

[ (W_1 W_2-W_2 W_1)^p  (W_1)^q  ]. 
The correspondence between the  operators and the harmonic
superspace operators is now clear, one simply replaces  with
 to obtain the highest weight states of each.




Explicit Computations 



In this section we will explicitly calculate two point functions
of the above operators. We will work with the lowest components of
superfields, the  and . (Here, ,
and  labels the adjoint representation of the gauge group
.) We list operators in a given irrep of the R-symmetry
group  (some of them were missed in),
and for the descendant operators write out the corresponding
Konishi-like long operator they come from. Then we look at Born
level and order  contributions to the two point functions of
the highest weight state operators. (Most of them were calculated
in).

In each representation we will have the descendant operators 
and "candidate 1/4-BPS" operators . We will compute the
order  two point functions 
 and 
. Then we will consider operators   - O L_i^_Born  (L
L^_Born ^-1  )^ij  L_j By
construction, they are orthogonal to all the  at Born level,
. Then we
will show that these operators  have protected two
point functions at order , 
 and 
 for all such operators 
. The claim is that these operators  are
1/4-BPS.



The basis of operators we will choose is slightly different from
the one used in. The operators introduced in
the preceding section are more natural and intuitive.





The representation  


 There is only one operator in the representation
 whose highest  weight state is &&
z_1 z_1  z_1 z_1 z_2 - z_1 z_2  z_1 z_1 z_1
while acting on  once with an  ladder operator
gives && 2  z_1 z_1  z_1 z_2 z_2 - z_1 z_2  z_1 z_1 z_2 - z_2 z_2  z_1 z_1 z_1 This operator has the same weight as the [2,1,2] operators (but is
of course orthogonal to them). The Born and order  overlaps
are   ^_Born  &=& 15 32  N (N^2 - 1) (N^2 - 4) ,  ^_g^2  = 0 .
So indeed it is a 1/4-BPS operator.

 There is only one operator in the representation
.  The highest  weight state operator is && z_1 z_1  z_1 z_1 z_1 z_2 - z_1 z_2  z_1 z_1 z_1 z_1 while acting on  once with an 
ladder operator gives  && 2 
z_1 z_1  z_1 z_1 z_2 z_2 + z_1 z_1  z_1 z_2
z_1 z_2 
&& - 2  z_1 z_2  z_1 z_1 z_1 z_2 -
z_2 z_2  z_1 z_1 z_1 z_1 This operator has the same
weight as the [2,2,2] operators (but is of course orthogonal to
them). The Born and order  overlaps are   ^_Born 
&=& 3 8  (N^2 - 1) (N^2 - 4) (N^2 - 9) ,  ^_g^2  = 0 . So indeed it is a 1/4-BPS
operator.

 Finally, there are 3 operators in the representation
. Their highest  weight state operators are _1 && z_1 z_1  z_1 z_1 z_1 z_1 z_2 - z_1
z_2  z_1 z_1 z_1 z_1 z_1


_2 && z_1 z_1 z_1  z_1 z_1 z_1 z_2 - z_1
z_1 z_2  z_1 z_1 z_1 z_1


_3 && z_1 z_1 ( z_1 z_1  z_1 z_1 z_2 -
z_1 z_2  z_1 z_1 z_1 ) while acting on 
once with an  ladder operator gives _1' && 2
 z_1 z_1  z_1 z_1 z_1 z_2 z_2 + 2  z_1 z_1 
z_1 z_1 z_2 z_1 z_2 
&& - 3  z_1 z_2  z_1 z_1 z_1 z_1 z_2 - z_2 z_2  z_1 z_1 z_1 z_1 z_1


_2' && 2  z_1 z_1 z_1  z_1 z_1 z_2 z_2 + z_1 z_1 z_1  z_1 z_2 z_1 z_2 
&& - z_1 z_1 z_2
 z_1 z_1 z_1 z_2 - 2  z_1 z_2 z_2  z_1 z_1 z_1
z_1


_3' && 2  z_1 z_1  z_1 z_1  z_1 z_2 z_2
+ z_1 z_1  z_1 z_2  z_1 z_1 z_2 
&& - 2
 z_1 z_2  z_1 z_2  z_1 z_1 z_1 - z_2 z_2 
z_1 z_1  z_1 z_1 z_1 These operators have the same
weight as the [2,3,2] operators (but are of course orthogonal to
them). The Born and order  overlaps are  _i' _j' ^_Born  &=&  

&& ( N^4 - 10 N^2 + 72
& -11 N^2 + 36     & 6 N (N^2 - 2)                        & N^4 - 4 N^2 + 18 & - 2 N ( 2 N^2 + 3)                   &                & 2 N^2 (N^2 + 5)
 ) , 

_i' _j' ^_g^2  &=& 0 . So
indeed they all are 1/4-BPS operators.



The Representation [2,0,2] 

The operators corresponding to () are  _1 &=& 2 ( z_1 z_1   z_2 z_2 - z_1 z_2   z_1 z_2 )


_2 &=& z_1 z_1 z_2 z_2 - z_1 z_2 z_1 z_2 The
single trace operator  is a descendant of the Konishi
scalar, (Q_ )^2  z_j z^j &=& Q_  z_j 2  ^j =

6 i 2  () [z_1,z_2] z_3 ,


(Q__3 )^2 (Q_ )^2  z_j z^j &=& -
12 i () Q__3  [z_1,z_2] _3

 & = & 24 () (_3 _3)
[z_1,z_2]^2


&=& - 48 () (_3 _3)  _2 ;
 or
 
(and we didn't bother to keep the same normalization factors for
all of them - just whatever looks better). The descendants arise
from the Konishi-like long primary operators as _4 &&
(Q^2 Q^2 )

 [ z_1 z_1 z_j z^j + z_1 z_1 z^j z_j ]


_5 && (Q^2 Q^2 )

 [ z_1 z_j z_1 z^j ]


_6 && (Q^2 Q^2 )

 [ z_1 z_1 ]  [ z_j z^j ]
 Note that another operator exists in a
long multiplet, whose descendant coincides with ,
_6 (Q^2 Q^2 )
 [ z_1 z_j ]  [ z_1 z^j ]
This may be established by observing
that the difference operator,  3
[ z_1 z_j ]  [ z_1 z^j ] -
[ z_1 z_1 ]  [ z_j z^j ]
is semi-short(This is the non-renormalised 20' operator 
discussed in ) .
A similar phenomenon occurs for higher representations,
and we will not mention it explicitly.


The linear combinations orthogonal to these operators
at Born level can be taken
as  _1 &=& _1 - 24 N 
_4 - 48 (2 N^2 - 3) N (3 N^2 - 2)  _5 + 40 3
N^2 - 2  _6


_2 &=& _2 - 4 N  _4 - 3 (7 N^2 - 8) N (3 N^2 - 2)  _5 + 5 3 N^2 - 2  _6


_3 &=& _3  - 20 3 N^2 - 2  _5
- 10 3 N^2 - 2  _6 The matrix of two point
functions in this basis is  (
_i _j^_Born  & 0 0 & L_i L_j^_Born   ) +
( 0 & 0 0 & L_i L_j^_g^2 
 ) where the (symmetric) blocks are  L_i L_j^_Born  =   ( 7 N^4 + 20
N^2 + 8 & -4 N^4 -10 N^2 +4 & 2 N (13 N^2 - 2)                    & 3 N^4 + 2              & - 2 N (6 N^2 + 1)                    &                        & 2 N^2 (3 N^2 + 13)
 ) and L_i L_j^_g^2  =
  ( 25 N^4
+ 148 N^2 + 8 & 15 N^4 - 66 N^2 + 4    & 4 N (27 N^2 + 17)                      & 10 N^4 + 22 N^2 + 2 & - 2 N (28 N^2 + 13)                      &                        & 2 N^2 (9 N^2 + 89)
 )


and _1 _1^_Born  & = & 360  _N N^2 (3 N^2 - 2)   (N^6 - 11 N^4 + 70 N^2 - 48)


_1 _2^_Born  & = &
-120  _N N^2 (3 N^2 - 2)   (5 N^4 - 36 N^2 + 24)

-20  _N N (3 N^2 - 2)    (13 N^2 - 12)


_3 _3^_Born  & = &
60  _N (3 N^2 - 2)   (N^2 + 1) (N^2 - 2)
.
Here and below we shall use the abbreviation,
 _N  (N^2 -1 ) (N^2 -4) / 64
.
As seen from (), the operators defined in
() have protected two-point functions 
 at order . This
shows that we can argue that , ,
 are the 1/4-BPS primaries we are after. Anomalous
scaling dimensions of long operators ()
match those of their Konishi-like primaries computed in
.


A Better basis for protected [2,2,2] operators 

It may seem odd that the operators mixing of the operators in the
representations  and  are in terms of
coefficients that are merely inverse powers of , while the
mixing coefficients for the operators we identified in the
representation  have more complicated denominators. This
distinction would also be surprising from the perspective of
AdS/CFT, since the more complicated denominators would suggest
that an infinite series of corrections in the string coupling 
 would appear for given 't Hooft coupling .
As a matter of fact, the mixing coefficients depend upon the bases
chosen for both the ,  and  operators as well
as the pure descendants. In a different basis, the coefficients
are all proportional to inverse powers of . For the
representation , these new operators are found easily,
and we have 
_1' &=& _1 + 4 N  _3 = _1
+ 4 N  _3 - 24 N  _4 - 32 N  _5


_2' &=& _2 + 1 2 N  _3 =
_2 - 4 N  _4 - 7 N  _5


_3' &=& _3 + 2 3 N  _1 - 4
N  _2 = _3  + 2 3 N  _1 - 4 N 
_2 - 10 3 N  _6  In
this new basis, the matrix of 2-pt functions now reads  _i'
_j' ^_Born  &=&




5 _N N^2  ( 24 (N^4 + 3 N^2 + 32) & -16
(N^2 + 9)       & 16 N (4 N^2 - 1)                       & (N^2 - 3) (N^2 + 9) & - 2 N (N^2 - 9)                        &                     & 4 (N^4 + 17 N^2 - 24)
 )

  ( N (N^2 - 9) & 0              & 0                      & 15 N (N^2 + 3) & - 30 N^2               &                & 3 N (N^2 + 6)
 )


L_i L_j^_g^2  &=& 
  ( 5 N (N^4 - 9) & 0              & 0
                & 75 N (N^2 + 7) & 180 (N^2 + 1)                 &                & 12 N (N^2 + 16)
 )


_i _j^_Born  &=& 15
(N^2 - 9) N^2 (N^2 - 2)    _N ( (N^2 - 1)
(N^2 - 4) & 4 N (N^2 - 1)                     & 2 N^2 (N^2 - 6)
 ) Here we should mention that the operator  (which was
overlooked in) has zero correlators with
everything else. The reason is that 
while all other operators satisfy .

Completeness of the Construction 

An important point which remains to be addressed is whether the
construction of the 1/4 BPS operators given above is exhaustive.
The fact that it is follows from  group theory in the
following manner. Given a 1/4 BPS representation of  of the
type , one begins by listing all possible monomial scalar
composite operators built out of  's
and  's.
(
    The remaining scalar field  never enters
    in the highest weight of a 1/4 BPS representation, though it will
    also be needed when describing 1/8 BPS operators.
)  These monomials form a basis for the linear space of scalar
composite operators of the form .
They can occur in representations , ,
... , . Then we have to show that the number of such
monomials matches the total number of operators we constructed in
these representations.


Let us illustrate how this works with an example. Consider the
[2,2,2] representation. The complete set of scalar composite
operators we can build out of 4 's and 2 's is
 
or the total of 11 operators. By taking linear combinations of
these, we can construct:

 4 totally symmetric tensors in the [0,6,0] corresponding
to the partitions of 6 in ();

 1 tensor in the representation [1,4,1], given in
();

 6 tensors in the representation [2,2,2], listed in
().

Thus there are no other scalar composite operators of the form 
.


In the same fashion, we can go through all other representations
we have considered in this paper and verify that we didn't leave
out any operators.
