We study
various   invariant field equations corresponding to rank 
tensor products of the Fock (singleton) representation of .
These equations are shown to
describe localization on  "branes" of different dimensions
embedded into the generalized space-time  with matrix (i.e.,
"central charge") coordinates.  The case
of bilinear tensor product is considered in detail.
The conserved currents built from bilinears
of rank 1 fields in  are shown to satisfy the field equations of the
rank 2 fields in . Also,
the rank 2 fields in  are shown to be
equivalent to the rank 1 fields in .

Introduction 

The idea that the set of  massless fields of all spins
should admit some manifestly  invariant formulation
in the ten-dimensional space-time 
with symmetric matrix coordinates 
 are  Majorana spinor indices)
was originally put forward by Fronsdal.
 In it was shown that the
set of free equations of motion for
massless fields of all spins in  Minkowski
space-time indeed exhibits
 symmetry, which acts locally at the infinitesimal level,
and admits equivalent description  in .
In the same reference the proposed construction was extended
to the generic case of  and it was argued that higher values
of  correspond to higher spin theories in higher dimensions.

The problem of formulating a  consistent nonlinear higher spin gauge
theory is of great interest in the context of revealing a most
symmetric phase of a theory of fundamental interactions. Recently
it was conjectured that higher spin gauge theories
appear as AdS/CFT dualsof the boundary conformal theories in
the limit . To check this conjecture
it is necessary to develop a nonlinear theory of massless higher spins
in the full generality, which is a nontrivial problem solved by now
only for the  and  higher spin theories at the level of
equations of motion(For more references on higher spin theories we
refer the reader to. Some  higher spin cubic
interactions in  theories were constructed recently in
.) .
 To this end it is important to work out
a most efficient formalism
that utilizes symmetries of the model as much as possible.
Once conformal higher spin theories are shown to
exhibit higher symplectic symmetries, an important step is to
develop explicitly  invariant formulation. This is achieved
by virtue of introducing the generalized space-time  .
The infinite towers of massless fields of all spins
in four dimensions are described by one scalar and one spinor
(equivalently, one scalar superfield) in .


The   generalized conformal symmetry transformations
in  are realized by the vector fields (see, e.g.,)
 P_  =-i  X^  ,L_ ^= 2i
 X^   X^  ,K^ =  -i X^ 
X^   X
^   .
The (nonzero)  commutation relations are
[L_ ^, L_ ^] = i( ^_L_ ^-
^_L_ ^),
[L_ ^, P_ ] = -i (^_P_ 
+^_P_ ),[L_ ^, K^ ] =i (^_K^ +
_^K^ ),[P_  , K^ ] = i 4 
(_^L_ ^+ _^L_ ^+
_^L_ ^+ _^L_ ^) .
Here  and  are generators of the
generalized translations and special conformal transformations.
The  algebra spanned by 
decomposes into the central subalgebra associated with the
generalized dilatation generator



 and the   generalized  Lorentz generators




The  invariant field equations considered inhave the form
 (
^2 X^  X^   - ^2 X^  X^  ) b(X) =0
for a scalar field  and
  X^   f_(X)       -
 X^   f_(X)      =0
for a svector field .
(We use the name "svector" (symplectic vector)
to distinguish 
from  vectors of the usual Lorentz algebra .
Note that svector fields obey the Fermi statistics).
For , because antisymmetrization of any two-component indices
 and  is equivalent to their contraction with
the  symplectic form , ()
and () coincide with the  massless Klein-Gordon and Dirac
equations, respectively. For ,  the equations
() and () in the generalized ten-dimensional
space-time  were shown in
 to encode the infinite set of the usual
 equations of motion for massless  fields of all spins.

One interpretation of the extended matrix space-time
is that it is merely a  useful technical device like superspace
for supersymmetry. It is
interesting however to see what are specificities of the
dynamics in the generalized space-time   treated as a
physical space-time. In the dynamics in 
described by the equations () and ()
was shown to be  consistent
with the principles of relativistic quantum field theory including
unitarity and microcausality. Most important difference compared to
the usual picture is that, because the system of equations
() and () is overdetermined, the true local phenomena
occur in a smaller space  called local Cauchy surface inand identified with the usual space of Minkowski space-time.
The formulations of  invariant systems
in terms of the generalized space-time 
and usual space-time are equivalent and
complementary. The description in terms of  provides clear
geometric origin for the  generalized conformal symmetry.
In particular it provides a geometric interpretation of the
electromagnetic duality transformations as particular generalized
Lorentz transformations. However, to define true local
fields, one has to resolve some constraints.
The description in terms of the Minkowski space-time,
that solves the latter problem, makes some of the symmetries
not manifest, namely, those that shift .

It was argued in that it should be possible to
formulate different  invariant equations in the same
space  associated with local Cauchy surfaces of different
dimensions. As a result, fields associated with different types
of  invariant equations will visualize   as Minkowski
space-times of different dimensions which may be interpreted as
different "branes" imbedded into the same generalized
space-time .  Our aim here is
to give  examples of such  invariant equations
and to analyze their properties. We will see that elementary solutions
of the obtained equations will give a field-theoretical realization of
BPS "preon" states introduced in.
 One of the observations of this paper is
that the dynamical equations for some of the rank 2  fields
are exactly of the form of
conservation conditions for "conserved" forms derived
in, which give rise to the full set of
bilinear conserved charges in the rank 1
conformal higher spin theory. On the other hand, we will show that
the rank 2 system with respect to  is equivalent to the rank
1 system with respect to , which fact fits nicely the idea
of generalized AdS/CFT correspondence.
In particular, it implies that there are conserved currents
of degree  built from the original rank 1 fields
in  to be integrated over branes of dimension
 to produce conserved charges independent of local
variations of branes.
(Recall that .)





We start in section 2 by summarizing some  general features
of the unfolded form of dynamical equations. An important
general fact emphasized here is that the space of solutions of
various partial differential equations invariant  under some symmetry
 exhibit  a natural structure of associative algebra induced by the
tensor algebra of semiinfinite modules over .
In section 3 dynamical equations associated with
 rank  fields in  are considered.  The
full list of field equations in the rank 2 tensor product is given.
In particular it is shown that conserved currents,
constructed in  from bilinears
of rank 1 fields in , satisfy some rank 2
field equations in . In section 4 it is shown that rank 2
fields in  are equivalent to the rank 1 fields in .
In  section 5  generic solutions of the rank 
field equations are presented. It is argued that normalizable
solutions in  admit decomposition into positive and negative frequency
solutions and allow extension to the normalizable rank 1 solutions
in . Section 6 contains
conclusions. Appendix contains some technicalities of the analysis
of the  cohomology associated with dynamical
rank 1 and rank 2 fields and field equations in the framework of
the unfolded dynamics formalism.


Unfolded Dynamics 

A natural approach            to dynamical equations
of motion in the framework of the higher spin gauge theory, referred to
as "unfolded formulation", consists of the reformulation of the dynamical
 equations in the form of some covariant constancy conditions.
This approach is particularly
useful for revealing symmetries of dynamical equations,
as well as for the analysis of their dynamical content
(appropriate Cauchy data etc).
Since it  plays a key role in the analysis of this
paper let us summarize some of its  properties.

Let some dynamical system be reformulated in the form
(d +)C(X) = 0 ,d=d X^A X^A ,
where  denotes some (usually infinite) set of fields
taking values in a linear space  forming a module over some
Lie algebra  (i.e., a section of the
linear fiber bundle with the fiber  over the space-time
with the local coordinates ),
while the 1-form 
is some fixed  connection of 
satisfying the flatness condition
d+[,]=0
(as usual, brackets  denote the Lie product in ).
The equation () is invariant under the
global symmetry  .
Actually, the system () and ()
is invariant under
the infinitesimal gauge transformations
(X) = d (X) + [(X) , (X)],
C (X) = -(X) C (X) ,
where  is an arbitrary symmetry parameter taking
values in .
For a
fixed , there is a leftover symmetry  with the parameter
 satisfying
(X) d (X) + [(X) , (X)] =0.
This equation is consistent as a consequence of ().
Therefore, it
reconstructs the dependence of  on  in terms of
its values
 at any point of space-time . The resulting
global symmetry algebra with the parameters  is .
It is therefore enough to observe that some dynamical system
can be reformulated in the form () with a flat connection 
taking values in some algebra  that acts in 
to reveal the global symmetry  () of the system ().
This approach is quite general since every free dynamical system can
be reformulated in the form () by adding enough auxiliary
variables (nonlinear systems are described in
terms of an appropriate generalization associated with free differential
algebras; for more detail see e.g.).


In this paper we will be interested in the particular
case of the equation () of the form
(+_- )C (X)= 0 ,
where the operators  and  have the properties
(_-)^2 =0,^2  =0,
 , _-  =0,
which imply that the corresponding connection is flat.
It is  assumed that the operator 
may act nontrivially
(differentiate) on the space-time coordinates while  is an
operator in the fiber  which acts pointwise in space-time (i.e.,
base manifold). It is also assumed that there
exists a grading operator  such that
it can be diagonalized in the fiber  ,
its spectrum  in  is bounded from below,
and
[G , ] = 0,[G
,_- ] = - _-.
A useful observation is  that
the nontrivial dynamics hidden in ()
is encoded by certain cohomology classes of .


Proposition 1 


Independent dynamical fields contained in the set of 0-forms 
take values in .


This is because all
fields in  (i.e., those with )
are auxiliary being expressed via the
space-time derivatives of the dynamical fields by virtue
of (). Here we use the assumption that
the operator  is algebraic
in the space-time sense, i.e. it does not contain space-time derivatives.
Note that
 is always non-zero because it
contains a nontrivial subspace of  of minimal
grade.


Proposition 2 


Space-time differential equations on dynamical 0-forms  contained in
() correspond to
elements of the cohomology group .
If grade  elements of  impose equations on
grade  dynamical fields, an order of differential
 equations is .

Indeed, consider the decomposition of the space of 0-forms 
into the direct sum of eigenspaces of . Let a
field having definite eigenvalue  of  be
denoted , . Suppose that the dynamical
content of the equations () with the eigenvalues
 with  is found. Applying the operator 
to the left hand side
of  the equations () at   we obtain
taking into account ()
that
_- (( C_k_q+1  )) =0.
Therefore  is
 closed. If the group  is trivial
in the grade 
sector,  any solution of () can be written in
the form

for some  field . This,
in turn, is equivalent to the statement that one can adjust
 in such a way
that  or, equivalently, that the part of the
equation () of the grade  is some constraint
that expresses  in terms of the derivatives of 
(again, we  use the assumption that
the operator  is algebraic in the space-time sense.)
If  is nontrivial, this means that the equation
() sends the corresponding cohomology class to zero and,
therefore, not only
expresses the field  in terms of  derivatives of
 but also imposes some additional
differential conditions on .

Note that if   is zero, the equation
() is equivalent to some (usually infinite) set of
constraints which express all fields contained in  via
derivatives of the dynamical fields.

The following comments are now in order.

Comment 1. 
When the fields  are -forms, dynamical fields are associated
with  while nontrivial dynamical equations
are characterized by .



Comment 2. 
Let us exchange the
roles of  and . Suppose  that  has trivial cohomology
group   and admits some grading operator
 which has
spectrum bounded from below and satisfies .
The analysis analogous
to that applied to  shows that in this case
there are no nontrivial consequences of the equation
() on the  form  as an element of .
For example, this is true for
the de Rahm differential  acting on the space of Taylor
expansions in powers of  with  counting
a polynomial degree. In that case,
given   at some , the equation
()  reconstructs  uniquely  as
 the Taylor power series expansion at
. This implies that the module  can be identified with the
linear space of all space-time derivatives of  which are
allowed to be nonzero by the dynamical equations.
This interpretation is useful in several respects.
In particular it tells us that
if  is spanned by unrestricted functions of some  variables, the
Cauchy problem in the space should be formulated
in terms of dimensional Cauchy surfaces because the spaces
of functions parametrising the space of solutions have to be
of the same type. If, on the other hand, global consideration
changes  this
would imply that not every element of  gives rise to some
global solution.

Comment 3. 
Suppose that  admits a triple  graded structure
 with Abelian subalgebras . Let
, where  is some basis of .
The dynamical fields  then identify with the
primary fields in  satisfying (Note
that the role of "translations" 
and "special conformal" generators  of  acting in the
fiber is exchanged in the unfolded formulation
as compared to the standard induced representation
approach in which primaries are defined directly
in the base manifold.) .
In other words, 
consists of singular vectors (i.e., vacua) of the irreducible submodules
over  in .  Obviously, any invariant submodule in  gives rise
to a subsystem in ().

forms a module over . In most interesting physical
applications  decomposes into (may be infinite)
direct sum of finite-dimensional representations of .



Comment 4. 
Suppose that . Let 
and  solve () with some operators
 and . Then
C_1,2  (X) = C_1 (X)C_2 (X)
solves () with
_1,2-  = _1-  Id +Id _2- .
The independent  equations contained in
() for  with the  operator ()
are associated with
 (which may be trivial, however).
As a result,
we see that the unfolded formulation of the dynamical equations
equips the variety of -quasiinvariant partial differential
equations with the structure of associative algebra isomorphic
to the tensor algebra of semiinfinite modules over .
This associative structure should not be confused with that of
the ring of  solutions of first order differential equations
because it maps solutions of
some set of (not necessarily first order) -quasiinvariant
partial differential equations to solutions of some other
-quasiinvariant equations.

One can consider  composite fields  of a particular symmetry type
associated with some irreducible representation of the
symmetric group  acting on the -fold tensor product of some
module . In particular,
 solves () in the
symmetric tensor square of .
For example, for the
model considered in this paper we will show  that
the formula () produces conserved currents bilinear
in the original dynamical fields while
the new equations are equivalent to the conservation conditions of
.
Finding primaries in  () turns
out to be equivalent to the construction of conserved currents
out of  and .
As  argued in section , the formula () provides
a basis for generalized 
correspondence with the composite dynamical fields
contained in 
interpreted as elementary  fields in a larger "bulk" space.

In this paper we apply this general approach to the analysis
of the  invariant dynamics.
The equations () and () were derived
in from the following unfolded system of equations
(
dX^   X^   +
dX^ ^2 y^y^ ) C(yX) =0,
where  are some auxiliary commuting variables.
To make contact with ()-() we set
d =dX^   X^   ,_- =dX^ ^2 y^y ^ ,G = y ^ y ^ .
The functions






are power series in . The spectrum of the grading operator
 is bounded from below because 
counts a half of the degree of a polynomial. Let a
field with definite eigenvalue  of  be
denoted , .
The equation () decomposes into the infinite set of
equations
^2 y^y ^ 
 C_1  (yX) =-
 X^   C_0(yX)
                        ,

^2 y^y ^ 
 C_3/2  (yX) =-
 X^   C_1/2  (yX),
 , 

^2 y^y ^ 
 C_1+k/2 (yX) =-
 X^   C_k/2 (yX) 
 .
Obviously, for this case   is spanned by constants and
linear polynomials
C_0(yX)  = b(X) , C_1/2 (yX)   =y^f_(X),
which give rise to the dynamical variables in the equations
() and (). In their turn, the equations
() and () are consequences of the
trivial identity








from which  it follows by virtue of
() that

 X^  
 y^  
C_k/2 (yX)
-
 X^  
 y^  
C_k/2 (yX)=0
and

 X^  
 X^  
C_k/2 (yX)
-
 X^  
 X^  
C_k/2 (yX)=0.
Setting here  one recovers () and (),
respectively.
To make sure that the equations () and () encode
the whole dynamical content of the
equation () one has to analyze
 . In it was claimed that the
-closed 1-forms, which are not exact, are
 e_,  y^dX^ , e_,  y^y^dX^ ,
where    and 
are arbitrary tensors having symmetry properties of the
Young tableaux
 
and
 
, respectively(Let us note that tensors
(multisvectors) are classified here according to
 the representations the grade zero
group  that acts on homogeneous
polynomials in . The grading operator 
is its central element. It is a generalization of the
dilatation in the usual conformal algebra.  In this paper
Young tableaux characterize representations of the
.)  (i.e., ,

and symmetrization over any three indices gives zero).
The explicit proof of this fact is given in Appendix.
The left hand sides of the equations
 () and  () form tensors of the
same symmetry types as the respective elements of  in
(). Thus, the equations (), ()    form the
full system of dynamical equations of motion. All other
equations in ()
either express auxiliary fields in terms of derivatives of
 and  or are consequences of these expressions.

The system () provides an example of the
equation () with the symmetry algebra
. The field  can be interpreted as
taking values in the Fock module 
generated by the creation operators
, i.e.
C(y,X)= C(y,X)0,y _0=0,
where
[y _,y^]=_ ^,[y^,y^]=0,[y _,y _]=0.
The generators of  are realized as various
bilinears built from  and ,
P_  = y _y _,K^  = y ^y ^,L_  ^  = y _, y ^.
Also it is obvious that the infinite-dimensional algebra
of various polynomials in the oscillators  and
 acts on the Fock module . As a result,
the Weyl algebra generated by the
oscillators  and  forms  global symmetry
of the system of equation (). This is the higher spin
conformal algebra discussed in.

The operator



provides a particular flat connection of 
with the only nonzero part in the sector of generalized translations
in . Thus, according to Comment 3, dynamical fields are
identified with the primaries of  with respect to .


 As shown in, the  global symmetry transformations
(), () of the dynamical fields are

b(X) &=&( ^   X^  
+^  _ +2^  _  X^ 
 X^  
&-&
_ [X^  + X^ 
X^   X^   ] )b(X),

f_(X) &=&( ^   X^  
+^  _ +2^  _  X^ 
 X^  
&-&
_ [ X^  + X^ 
X^   X^   ] )f_(X)
+(^  _- _ X^  )f_(X)  ,
where ,  and  are
independent
parameters of generalized translations, Lorentz transformations along with
dilatations, and special conformal transformations, respectively.
These transformations can be extended to  acting on the
supermultiplet formed by scalar  and svector  and to
extended conformal supersymmetry  acting on the appropriate
sets of scalars and svectors (see  also).

Note that the Fock module () used to describe classical
dynamics is not unitary. However, it is dual by virtue of
an appropriate Bogolyubov transform to the
unitary Fock module  describing the space of quantum states
with the positive norm.

Tensor product 

Analogous construction can be applied to the rank  tensor product
of any number  of the Fock representations of . The
generators of  then have a form of a sum of  bilinears
built from  mutually commuting copies of  oscillators
[y _i  ,y_j^]=_ij _ ^,[y_i^,y_j^]=0,[y _i  ,y _j ]=0,i,j = 1r.
This construction is typical for the oscillator realization of
representations of symplectic algebras.


Rank  dynamics in  is described by a field 
polynomial in the real variables 
C(yX)=_n
f__1 _n  ^i_1 i_n  (X)
y_i_1 ^_1 y_i_n ^_n  ,
where
,  and
 are real matrix coordinates of
. The field  can be thought of as
taking values in the rank  tensor product
 of the Fock
module .
The  operator  has the form
_-=_i=1 ^r
dX^ ^2 y^_iy ^_i ,
so that the equation () reads
(
dX^   X^   +
_i=1 ^r
dX^ ^2 y^_iy ^_i 
)
C(yX) =0.
According to the general argument of section ,  it
is invariant under the  global symmetry.

Let us note that the following equations are consequences
of ()
 X^[_1 _1  
 X^_2 _2  
 X^_r+1 ] _r+1    C(yX)=0
and
 X^[_1 _1  
 X^_2 _2  
 X^_r  _r   
 y^_r+1 ] _i  C(yX)=0,
where square brackets imply total antisymmetrization of the indices
. The role of the equation ()
is analogous  to that of the Klein-Gordon equation for the usual massless
fields. It is satisfied by every rank   field in .
The equation () is analogous to the Dirac equation.


According to the Comment 2 of Section 2, modules of solutions of
the rank  equations in  are functions of  variables
. As a result, the dimension of a "local Cauchy bundle"
 on which  initial data should be given to fix
a form of the solution everywhere in  is .

Let us now focus on the rank 2 case. Instead of
the real variables  and fields ,
it is convenient to introduce complex variables
compl 
2  z^y^_1+i y _2^,2  ^y^_1-i y _2^and field variables
(z,z X)=
c __1 _k;_1 _n (X)
z^_1  z^_k   ^_1   ^_n .

In these terms
_- =2 dX^ 
 ^2 z^ ^ 

,G = ( z^ z^  +
z ^ z ^ ).
The equation  () now reads
dX^   X^   +
2 dX^ 
^2 z^ ^ 
C(z,z X) = 0.
The following simple consequences of the equation () are
true
^_1,_2,_3 
 X^_1 _1  
 X^_2 _2  
 X^_3 _3  (z,z X)=0,
^_1,_2,_3 
 X^_1 _1  
 z^_2  
 ^_3  
(z,X)=0,
^_1,_2,_3 
 X^_1 _1  
 X^_2 _2  
 z^_3  
(z,X)=0,
^_1,_2,_3 
 X^_1 _1  
 X^_2 _2  
  ^_3  
(z,X)=0,
^_1,_2

 X^_1 _1  
 z^_2  
 z^_2  
(z,X)=0,
^_1,_2 
^_1,_2 
 X^_1 _1  
  ^_2  
  ^_2  
(z,X)=0,
where  and  are
arbitrary totally antisymmetric tensors, introduced to impose
appropriate antisymmetrizations.

The equation () decomposes into the infinite set of
subsystems associated with different integer
eigenvalues of the operator

 H   = h_z - h_z  ,h_z =  z^ z^ , h_z  =
z ^ z ^ ,
which commutes with .
Introducing notation  for the
fields taking values in
the eigenspaces of the operators  and 
h_z_n,m =n_n,m  ,h_ _n,m =m_n,m ,n,m0,
the  equation () acquires the form

( ^2 z^ ^ 
+^2 ^z ^ )
 _n+1,m+1 (z,X) =-
 X^   _n,m (z,X).
To find which fields among 
are dynamical, one has to consider the cohomology group 
A  closed form   satisfies
(^2 ^z^ + ^2 z^^ ).
Being a form,  cannot be exact, i.e. 
consists of all solutions of ().
As we show in Appendix,
 contains  the following  0-forms:
a constant , antisymmetric tensor
,
 degree-  analytic polynomials  
 and
 degree-  anti-analytic polynomials
  .


 

 

According to the general argument of section ,
all other components of  are
expressed by () via  higher derivatives of
the dynamical fields.

Let us note that the obtained list is in the one-to-one correspondence
with the list of irreducible representations of  in the
tensor product of singletons.
This fact is not occasional, being a consequence of the
Comment 3  of section .
The precise matching between the decompositions of
the tensor products of the unitary singleton
modules and the non-unitary ones describing
classical fields in the unfolded formulation is due to
the  duality between quantum and classical descriptions
, that was shown to have a form of a nonunitary
Bogolyubov transform  in for    and then infor  and higher even .


Setting  in ()-()
 we obtain the following list of equations on the
dynamical fields ()
^_1,_2,_3 
 X^_1 _1  
 X^_2 _2  
 X^_3 _3   c(X)=&0&  ,

   .


Here  the Young tableaux describe the symmetry types of
the left hand sides of the field equations
and   is an
arbitrary totally antisymmetric tensor.  Note that,
analogously to the fact that massless fields of any spin
in the Minkowski space-time satisfy the massless Klein-Gordon
equation, any solution  of the  equations
()-() satisfies ().

To check whether this list of equations is complete,
one has to analyze .
This analysis is analogous to that of 
but  somewhat more complicated. The details are given in Appendix.
The final result is that there are two  irreducible

The nontrivial dynamical equations associated with the
 elements of

same . An elementary analysis of () then
shows that the equations
()-()

the general procedure described in the section ,
applied to the equation ().
Therefore  the list of the equations

equations in () are either some constraints on the

Rank 2 - rank 1 correspondence 

There are two basis relationships between systems of
ranks 1 and 2. The first one is that, as follows from
the comment 4 of section ,
bilinears of the rank 1 fields in 
solve the rank 2 equations in . The second one is that the
rank 2 system in  turns out to be equivalent to
the rank 1 system in .

The first property manifests itself in the fact that
the equations () and
() have the  form of
the conservation condition for the generalized stress tensors
built in, where it was derived from the requirement that
the generalized stress tensors should allow to build conserved
charges associated with the higher spin conformal symmetries
as integrals of some  closed  -forms over -dimensional
surfaces in . Namely, it was shown in that
the  -form

() &=&
__1 _M 
dX^_1 _1 dX^_M _M 
 & & __1 _t  ^_M+1  _M+s   X^_M+s+1  _1 X^_M+s+t 
_t  T__1 _M+s+t  
is closed provided that the generalized stress tensor
 satisfies the equation
().
Here 
 are some constants identified with
the parameters of the higher spin conformal
global symmetry generated by the conserved charges
Q() = _S (),
where  is some -dimensional surface in .
The explicit expression for




in terms of bilinears of rank 1 fields, derived in, is
T^kl (zX)= ^k (z X) ^l (i zX) .
(Here  and  are "color" indices taking an arbitrary number of
values).
It is now elementary to reveal its meaning in the context of the
comment 4 of section 2. Indeed, once a  field 
satisfies the equation () with the rank 1
operator , the rank 2 field of the form
C^kl (y_1 , y_2 X)= C^k(y_1  X) C^l(y_2 X)
satisfies the equation () with the rank 2
 operator. The primaries in 

that correspond to one-row Young tableaux are the generalized
stress tensors found in.
Singling out the analytic and antianalytic parts of ()
in terms of the complex variables (),
which correspond to the appropriate primaries, one
gets the formula (). (Let us note that the
usual conformal higher spin currentsare also known to be primaries
of the conformal group in the dual framework  of induced
representations.)

 From the AdS/CFT correspondence perspective
the fact that the conservation conditions for currents built
from the rank 1 fields are particular equations of motion
in the rank  2 system
 suggests that, analogously to the case of usual conformal group
considered in, there must be a correspondence
between bilinears built of rank 1 boundary fields and rank 2
bulk higher spin
gauge fields in . Note that the
rank 2 fields , ,
and , 
() with  are not associated with any
conserved currents. Presumably this implies that
they correspond to some non-gauge members of the
higher spin multiplets of a rank 2 theory, analogous to the
scalar and spinor fields in the  higher spin theory
.

 Let us now extend the rank 2 equations ()
to a larger system
d X^  X^  C+d X^ (
^2 y^_1y _1^ + ^2 y^_2y _2^ )C=0,
d W^  W^  C+d W^  (
^2 y^_1y _1^ - ^2 y^_2y _2^ )C=0,
 d Z^  Z^  C + 2 d Z^ 
 ^2 y^_1y _2^ 
C=0
with symmetric  and arbitrary  .
This extension is consistent
(i.e., the corresponding connection is flat) and contains the original
rank 2 system () as a part
(). On the other hand, it is
nothing but the rank 1 system ()
with the doubled number of auxiliary variables
. The consistency of
the system ()-() implies
that every solution  of () is extended by virtue of
() and ()
to some solution of the whole system  because the equations
(), () just reconstruct the dependence on the coordinates
 and  for a given value of .
Therefore, the rank 2 system in  is promoted to the rank 1 system in
 in such a way, that every solution in the original rank 2
system
is promoted to some solution of the rank 1 system in 
and vise versa.


Among other things, this implies
that there exist conserved currents, built from the rank 2 fields
in , to be integrated over -dimensional surfaces in 
to produce conserved charges.
Choosing a  integration surface to belong to 
(recall that ) one
gets generalized stress tensors constructed from rank 2 fields.
Substituting the conserved currents built from
bilinears of the rank 1 fields in  in place of the rank 2 fields,
one finds conserved charges being of fourth order in the original rank 1 fields
in , which are associated with the appropriate on-mass-shell closed 
forms. That this process can be continued suggests that
there is a chain of dualities among various rank  theories
by means of the rank doubling via further products analogous to
(). This conclusion is consistent with the conjecture on
the existence of
an infinite chain of  type dualities in higher spin
theories suggested in
(To avoid misunderstandings, let us note that this
kind of dualities was conjectured in to be true
for the chain of theories containing all higher spin massless
fields, which are different from the particular
reduced model associated with N=4 SYM theory for which no
infinite chain of dualities is expected.) .
Higher nonlinear combinations of the rank 1 fields should be
associated with higher rank gauge fields in .


Solutions 
Let us analyze  solutions of the equations
()-(). For
,
 the equation () requires
^, ,  
k_  k_  k_ =0
for any totally antisymmetric .
This is solved by any  rank   matrix .
Indeed, any symmetric matrix
  can be diagonalized by a  transformation.
 From () it follows that
the product of any three eigenvalues  of  is equal to zero.
So at most two of them can be nonzero. For this case one can write
k_ =a_ij _^i_^j
with  two arbitrary vectors  and
some symmetric form  . Eq. () provides
a general solution of ().

Because any solution of  the equations of
motion ()-()
satisfies (), the respective harmonic solutions have a
 form
c_...  (X) = c_... ^  ()
 i a_ij _^i_^j  X^ . Specifically, the equations  ()-() require
 c _, (X)= &
 A^() (_ ^1^2_ -
_ ^1^2_ )
(i a_ij _^i_^j  X^ )
 & A^,
  c __1_n (X)= &
A_i_1i_n ()__1 ^i_1 __n ^i_n 
(i a_ij _^i_^j  X^ ) &
n0 ,
 c __1_n (X)=&
A_i_1i_n  ()__1 ^i_1 __n ^i_n 
(i a_ij _^i_^j  X^ ) &
n0,
where   is an arbitrary tensor
traceless with respect to
the form 

a^ik  A_i k j_3j_n   =0.
Indeed, taking into account that the indices  take two values,
that allows one to replace any
antisymmetrization by the epsilon symbol
,
it is  easy to see that the condition






which follows from (), is equivalent to
().

Let us now consider the general case of an arbitrary rank.
As mentioned in Section 3,


the scalar equation () is satisfied by any solution.
This fixes the rank  spectral condition for a particular harmonic
in the form

^_1, , _r+1  
k__1 _1 k__r+1  _r+1   =0
for any totally antisymmetric parameter
.
This condition implies that the rank of the wave "vector"
 cannot exceed ,  i.e.  is
described by the same formula (),
in which the indices  take  values.
Let us note that this formula has the same form as the
rank  "preon" representation for momenta
in the brane models with partially broken
supersymmetries in the generalized space-time with
"central charge" coordinates. The harmonic solutions in the
higher rank models in  , considered in this paper,
 therefore provide the field-theoretical realization of the
 BPS states with fractional supersymmetry in the
higher spin theories.


Generic solution of the scalar field equation ()
can be represented in the form () with .
By a  linear transformation



one can transform   to one of the
canonical forms ,

c r c 
&&
r r 

p  
&q  


a^(pq)   =&
 &
(
r r 
I&0
0&-I
)
with  (assuming that the rest elements of
 vanish if ).
As a result, we have
C(X) =_p+q=r  C^(pq)  (X)
where
C^(pq) (X)=
d^M  f ^(pq) ()
(ia^pq _ij _^i_^j X^  ).
Note
that the degenerate cases with  are
described by  the formula () with 
in which an appropriate  - functional measure is
included into
,
which
requires those components of , which are null vectors
of  , to vanish.

The  expression in the exponential ()
is invariant under
 rotations acting on the indices , which
leave the metric  invariant. This means
that the "Fourier components"
 are defined on .
Note that analogous phenomenon takes place in the rank 1 system
of with the group  =  in place of .
A new feature of the rank  case is that it allows
noncompact situations with . In this case a volume
of a typical orbit of  is  infinite and the expression
() requires insertion of an appropriate delta-function
f ^(pq) ()=(())f ^(pq) (),
where  is some  gauge function
which fixes a representative of an orbit of .

Analogously to what was shown in for the rank 1 system,
the solutions  and  describe positive
and negative frequency modes to be associated with the creation and
annihilation operators upon quantization.  The solutions  
with  do not allow
a decomposition into  positive and negative frequency parts and
thus
do not allow for a consistent quantization. The group-theoretical
meaning of the decomposition () is clear.
Let us for simplicity consider the rank 2 case. The solutions
of the equations ()-()  correspond to the
tensor product
of the solutions of the equations considered in.
Let the latter
be formally denoted  ,
where  and 
are mutually conjugated positive- and negative-frequency parts.
Quantization identifies  with the unitary left module  of
one-particle quantum states.  is associated with the conjugated
 right module
.  Then, the spaces of solutions 
and  are
associated, respectively, with , 
 and .
If we would consider the quantum picture, by tensoring the
one-particle states we would only have
 and its conjugate. This suggests that the modes with
 must be irrelevant.
Let us argue that, indeed, these modes are unstable and can
be ruled out
by requiring a solution to be normalizable with respect
to a natural norm.

 The equations ()-()  show that every
solution of the rank  2 system can be
promoted to a solution of some rank  1 system in the larger space .
It is not guaranteed however that
an oscillating solution in  remains oscillating in .
For the rank 2 system, the extension  of a harmonic
solution to  is
C^(20) =
d^2M  f^(20) ()
i((_^1_^1 +_^2_^2) X^  +
(_^1_^1 - _^2_^2) W^ 
+2 _^1_^2 Z^ )
,
C^(11) =
d^2M  f^(11) ()
i((_^1_^1 -_^2_^2) X^  +
(_^1_^1 + _^2_^2) W^ 
+2i_^1_^2 Z^ )
,
C^(02) =
d^2M  f^(02) ()
i((-_^1_^1 -_^2_^2) X^  -
(_^1_^1 - _^2_^2) W^ 
-2 _^1_^2 Z^ )
.
We see that the extensions associated with
 and  are still oscillating in the extended
space 
while that associated with 
exponentially grows along some of the
directions in , thus exhibiting instability.
As observed in, the space of solutions of the
rank 1
equation () admits an invariant form 
defined in terms of the conserved charge () as
. It has a form of an
integral over an  arbitrary
space-like -dimensional surface  in  and
is independent of  local variations
of   provided that  satisfies the field equations
 (Recall that the initial data problem
in  for the equations () and () is given on
a -dimensional "local Cauchy bundle"because solutions are parametrized
 by functions of  variables .) .
Using this construction for the rank 1 solution
in  generated from the rank 2 solution in 
according to  ()-(), one obtains the
invariant form on  rank 2 solutions.
Choosing an integration
surface in  in such a way that some of the directions are
included along which a solution blows up, one can see that for such
solutions the norm gets  infinite. To make this argument
complete it remains to prove that such a rotation of
the integration surface can be obtained by a continuous deformation.
It is simpler, however, to use the Fourier transformed
representation for the norm in  that was shown into have a form



Inserting here () one finds that the delta-function gets
squared producing an infinite factor  originating from the
infinite volume of the orbit of . This factor
is finite only for the compact cases of  and 
associated with the true positive- and negative-frequency solutions
that allow consistent quantization.
Thus, the modes  with  are ruled out as
non-normalizable very much as the exponentially growing modes with
imaginary  in the rank 1 case, which are formally
allowed by the field equations.

The  normalizable solutions correspond
only to purely positive- or negative- frequency modes which,
by analogy with the analysis of , are to be
associated with the one-particle spaces of quantum states
and their conjugates by virtue of quantization. In fact, the
norm  is the usual Fock space norm for these
quantum states. Thus, the normalizable
sector of the rank 2 system in  is equivalent to the
 normalizable rank 1 system in .


Conclusions 

In this paper the new  invariant equations of
motion, which describe propagation in -dimensional
space-time  with matrix coordinates
 (), are derived.
The idea of the derivation  is based on the
unfolded formulation of the dynamical equations in the form of
covariant constancy equations imposed on the fields taking
values in some
module  over the chosen symmetry algebra . Inthis scheme was applied to the Fock  module 
for the oscillator representation of .
The resulting equations () and () were shown
to describe matter localized on a -dimensional local Cauchy
bundle being some limiting -dimensional surface in .
The equations formulated in this paper result from 
and, more generally,
 .




The list of various types of independent fields in the
proposed equations is shown to be in the one-to-one correspondence with
the content of the decomposition of the tensor product of a number of unitary
Fock modules  over  into irreducible submodules. This fact
is in accordance with the
Bogolyubov transform type dualitybetween the unitary modules of
one-particle quantum states and non-unitary  modules which appear in
the unfolded formulation of the classical field equations.

The space of solutions is parametrized by functions
of  variables. As a result, the local Cauchy bundles 
associated with the proposed field equations have dimension .
Note that as explained in
, the dimension of space  where true localization of
events is possible, which is identified with the base manifold
of the local Cauchy bundle , is generically lower
than the dimension of .
 For example, for the lowest values of , the
rank 1 local Cauchy bundles 
 have the structure  with the base manifolds
(local Cauchy surfaces)
 as the physical spaces and
fiber compact manifolds ,
respectively. This corresponds to
 ,  and  Minkowski space-times.
The fibers ,  and  give rise to some spin degrees
of freedom.  In particular, for the case of , the modes of 
are   massless scalar and spinor. For the case of , modes of
  give rise to the infinite tower of spins
in the  Minkowski space-time.
One conclusion of this paper
is that different local equations formulated
in the same space
 may visualize it differently via its
subspaces of different dimensions. Moreover, it is shown that
the space-time  visualized through the rank two equations
is physically undistinguishable from the space-time 
visualized through the rank 1 system. This suggests that
it may be  enough to study the rank 1 systems in  with
various .

Most of the rank 2 equations of motions obtained in this paper
have the form of the conservation conditions that were shown
in  to give rise to the conserved charges of the
rank 1 system.  This result  suggests the generalized 
correspondence  between
fields in rank 2 models and currents in rank 1 models. Remarkably,
the chain of correspondences can be continued to all rank 
models so that fields in the  model correspond to bilinear
currents in the  model,
 quartic currents in the
 model etc. This result supports the
conjecture of that the full higher spin models may
exhibit infinite chains of  dualities.
It is tempting to speculate
that there are two most
natural options. First is that the fundamental theory is the
one with  which is the usual  conformal theory
or even with (This case is degenerate.
One can speculate that it corresponds to left or right movers
of a   conformal theory. Although there are no
nontrivial equations imposed on the dynamical fields in this case
one can formally apply the general arguments of this paper
to this system as well.) . An opposite
extreme option is that of . The usual models,
like for example  higher spin theories,
may result from an appropriate
breakdown of  down to, say, . The
 case has a good chance to be
 related to a higher spin
formulation of the superstring theory. It may happen,
however, that the two seemingly opposite
options are not that different because
of the conjectured infinite chain of dualities.



The results of this paper suggest a new
dynamical mechanism for realization of branes of different dimensions
that live in the same generalized space-time .
The equations suggested in this paper provide a field-theoretical
realization of the "preon" construction
for BPS states suggested in.
In a nonlinear version of the higher spin theory in the
generalized space-time
to be developed, fields associated with  branes of different dimensions
are expected to interact to each other.
Hopefully this will eventually lead to
the microscopic theory of branes.

cohomology 

Let us first recall some elementary facts relevant to the
cohomology analysis. Let a linear operator 
act in some linear space  and satisfy
. By definition,

operator, . Then the operator
 , ^* 
satisfies
[, ] = [^*, ] =0.
 From () it follows that
 . Therefore,
. Suppose
now that  is a Hilbert space in which
 and  are conjugated and that the operator 
is quasifinite-dimensional, i.e. 
with finite-dimensional subspaces  such that 
 and  is orthogonal to  for .
Then  can be diagonalized
and it is easy to see that

. Therefore, for this case,
H().
This formula is useful in the practical analysis because
it is usually  simpler to compute  than to
find  the cohomology  directly.

Let us denote   by . Then

Let  and  be the linear spaces spanned by

Let the rank 1 and rank 2 operators  acting in

The operators

 extends it to  




 with the carrier space .
Since the action of  in  leaves a  degree of a polynomial
invariant,  decomposes into the infinite
direct sum of finite-dimensional submodules over .
Irreducible finite-dimensional submodules are characterized by their
 lowest (equivalently, highest) weights and eigenvalues of
the central element of  (). The weight basis  of
 is convenient because the operator  turns
out to be diagonal in this basis.



Indeed, let  be some lowest  vector
with fixed weight and eigenvalue of
the central element of , i.e.
f_1 p =0,h_1 p = p n_1 p = p.
  From (), () it follows  that  has a form
p_(q,r) =
c__1_q, _1 _r  z^_1 z^_q   t^_1 
t^_r ,= r-q,=r+q,
where  is some
tensor with the symmetry properties of the  Young tableau
 .

As a result, every polynomial  is a linear combination of
the polynomials
P_(qr) ^(b)  (z,t)
=(e_1

)^b
p_(qr) (z,t)
with various  and .
Using  that , one finds
_1 P_(qr) ^(b)  =( 2 e_1 f_1  - (n_1-1) h_1 )
(e_1)^b p_(qr) 

= _1  P_(qr) ^(b) ,
where
_1 =(2(q-b-r+1)b+(q-b)(q-b-1)-(b+r)(b+r-1)).
Note that, because the representations under
consideration are finite-dimensional, the polynomials
  with  vanish, i.e. the inequality
  q-b-r&& 0
is true.
The degree of 
in  is equal to . As a result we have  and
  in the subspaces  and   associated with
rank 1 cohomology groups  and , respectively.


The rank 2 case will be analyzed in terms of

Again,   decomposes into the infinite direct sum
of irreducible finite-dimensional modules over .
Let  be some lowest  vector
with fixed weight and eigenvalue of
, i.e.
f_1 p =0,f_2 p =0,h_1 p = _1 p,h_2 p = _2 p n_2 p = p.
  From () it follows  that  has a form
p_(s,q,r) =
c__1_s, _1_q, _1 _r 
^_1 ^_s 
z^_1 z^_q   t^_1 
t^_r 
 _1 = q-s,_2 = r-q,
=r+q+s,
where

  .
Every polynomial  is some linear combination of the 
 

polynomials of the form

P_(sqr) ^(bak)

+ a(2-a)+(s-k-a-1)(q+k-b)-(a+b+r)(a+b+r-1).
Because all representations of  under
consideration are finite-dimensional
the following inequalities take place
  s-k-a&& 0,

  q+k-b&& 0,
  q r,
  s-k-q0.
Eqs. (), () manifest the simple fact that
the degrees of  and  are nonnegative. Eq. () is obvious
from the Young tableau representation of the lowest vector of .
Eq.() is understood  analogously taking into account
the explicit form of   in ().

rank   
Consider polynomials  corresponding to the rank 1
1-forms.

I.  Let . Then . As a result the only allowed

II. Let .  The only allowed
solution is .

It is easy to see
that   and

Since exact forms are symmetric in all variables,
the obtained solutions belong to the nontrivial cohomology
classes. Thus the rank 1 cohomology group 
 is spanned by





rank   
Consider polynomials 
corresponding to the rank 2 0-forms.
Using () along with the fact that
  for the case of 0-forms
 one finds that the equation  amounts to
k(s-k-q+1)+ (s-k-1)(q+k)=0.
 From () one has
 or, equivalently,  .

I. Let  . Then  and, therefore,  . 

II. Let . Then () requires

and  .

As a result () has  the following solutions:
  
.
One can check that
 ,  and 
are    -closed.
Thus the cohomology group 
is parametrized by the following forms:











rank   
Consider polynomials
    corresponding to rank 2  1-forms.
In this case   .  Then, taking into account  (),
the  equation  amounts to
 (q+k)(b-1)+(s-k+b)a+k(s-k-q+1)+(s-k-a)(q+k-b)=2 .
The problem is to solve ()
in nonnegative integers at the conditions  ()-()
along with the two obvious conditions
  a+b& & 2,

 s& & 2. 
(The meaning of () is that,  to have polynomials
bilinear in  used to describe 1-forms, the first row of the
respective Young tableaux must contain at least two cells.)

 From () it follows  that there are six  cases:
,
,
,
,
 and
. Note, that only four of these six cases are
essentially different because the interchange 
is equivalent to . 

I. Let  . Then () has the form
k(s-k-q+1)+(s-k-1)(q+k)&=&2.
 From (), () it follows  that
 and, therefore, () requires
 , ,  .

II. Let  ,     . Then () has the form
k(s-k-q+1)+(s-k-1)(q+k)&=&0.  From () and () one can see that
 and . Therefore,
() requires  and .
The first condition requires
. Then from (), () one finds that the second
one has no admissible solutions.



III. Let , . Then () has the form
k(s-k-q+1)+(s-k)(q+k-1)&=&2.
Since  we have   .  From () it follows that
.  From () we get .
As a result, the two terms on the left hand side of () are
non-negative. So, there are three different cases:

A.  ,
. The only admissible solution is    

B.  , . The only solution is
, , .

C.  , . It is easy to see that
these equations have no admissible solutions.

IV.  Let , .  Then () has the form
(q+k) +k(s-k-q+1)+(s-k)(q+k-2)&=&2.
Using () one gets ,
. Using () one gets
, , .

Instead of considering the rest two cases with
 and
 we simply add the
conjugated forms resulting from the interchange 
 to  get the full list
of  zero modes.
It is easy to see that the obtained solutions
are    -closed but not exact.
As a result, the cohomology group 
is spanned by
