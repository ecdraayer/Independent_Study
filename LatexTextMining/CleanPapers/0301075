Abstract 
(R-channel) TBA is elaborated 
to find the effective central charge dependence  
on the boundary parameters
for the massless boundary sine-Gordon model 
with the coupling constant  
with  a positive integer. 
Numerical analysis 
of the massless boundary TBA demonstrates that 
excited state contributions 
should be included to have the right behavior of 
the effective central charge.

Introduction  
The low dimensional quantum system 
such as a quantum wire with boundaries 
is not easy to study in terms of mean field approach
due to large quantum fluctuations.
The system is also strongly affected by the 
the existence of boundaries. 
For example, one needs a good knowledge of the  
the low dimensional quantum field theory
to study the quantum Hall edge tunnelling .

In this work, the massless 
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid with boundaries 
is studied motivated by SNS junction super-conductor analysis. 
This system is summarized in terms of the boundary sine-Gordon model(bSG).
A = 
d^2x 14 (_a )^2
-^(1) _B  _y=0   dx  2 
(b(^(1) _0))
-^(2) _B  _y=R   dx 
2 ( b ((2) _0)).
Our task is to find the free energy of the finite system 
as the function of the boundary parameter 
.
To do this, we first consider the massive sine-Gordon model with boundaries 
and put the bulk mass vanish.  

The massive bSG is written as 
A &=&d^2x[14 (_a )^2
-2((2 b )-1)]


&&- ^(1) _B  _y=0 dx 
2 ( b ((1) _0))
-^(2) _B  _y=R   dx  
2 ( b ((2) _0)),
The coupling constant  is restricted to be less than 1.   
(Note that   is scaled by  from the conventional choice 
 ).

The bulk sine-Gordon model (SG) 
belongs to the category of two dimensional 
integrable quantum field theories
and allows an exact treatment of the system
.
Integrable quantum systems 
have been studied systematically 
after the pioneering work of Zamolodchikov.
The system is regarded as a conformal system  
perturbed by an interaction and infinite number of conserved 
quantities are obtained.
The integrability of the bSG was demonstrated in. 


The scale dependence of the system can be studied
by the method, thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA)
.  Suppose a system lies along the y-axis 
with a  finite size  
and appropriate boundary conditions are imposed at
each end as in Fig ().
The -direction is periodic and its size  is put to  
in the thermodynamic limit. 


 
space with two boundaries () and ()  
The partition function with this boundaries is given as 
Z_  = Tr  e^-L H_   = e^-L E_ (R) 
where  is the Hamiltonian of the system of size  
with boundary () and (). 
 is the ground state energy in the thermodynamic limit,
which depends on the size .

The same system can be viewed as the one with initial state  and  
final state .
In this picture, the bulk is periodic in  
as in Fig. ().


 
space with two states  
and   
Then the same partition function is evaluated 
using the bulk Hamiltonian  of the system.
Z_   e^-RL f_  (R)  
= <B_ e^-RH B_> 
= (  _A  
<B_aA> <AB_b> e^-R E_A   <AA>  
) ,

where  is the free energy density per length
and  is the complete set of the bulk Hamiltonian eigenstates.
The finite size effect of the SG (with boundary)
was analyzed in for diagonal case
using thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (R-channel TBA). 

In section 2, we summarize the massive (R-channel) 
TBA for the bulk sine-Gordon model 
with boundary sine-Gordon interaction.
In this analysis, we restrict the coupling constant 
 to a positive integer
() so that the bulk scattering matrix is diagonal
but non-diagonal boundary scattering is allowed. 
The topological charge violation at the boundary 
is incorporated following the suggestion given in 
. This TBA has the bulk and boundary scale dependence 
as well as the boundary parameter dependence. 

In section 3,  massless (R-channel) TBA 
for the massless boundary sine-Gordon model
is obtained 
as the massless limit of the massive TBA. 
It is demonstrated that outside a certain parameter range
(), 
the naive TBA for the ground state energy does not work.
A modified massless TBA is proposed so that 
excited state contribution is included 
according to the suggestion in.
The numerical analysis of this modified TBA
confirms the energy dependence 
on the boundary parameters as expected,
which also supports the relation between 
boundary scattering parameters 
and action parameters.  
Section 4 is the conclusion.

Summary of Massive TBA for boundary sine-Gordon  
The bulk sine-Gordon periodic potential allows 
a soliton with topological charge  
and an antisoliton with the charge .  
Both of them have the same mass  
as the result of  
the charge conjugation symmetry, .
The mass is given in terms of  , 
 (b^2)   =
[M     2 
(12 -2 b^2 )   
 ( b^2 2-2b^2 )   ]^2-2b^2 
In addition, there are  
topologically neutral particles, breathers 
(interpreted as the soliton-antisoliton bound states).
Their masses are given as 
m_a =2  M  
( a 2  )
a=1,2,, n_b.
 is the number of breather species, 
 positive integer less than .

The free energy density in Eq. ()
is expanded in terms of the bulk Hamiltonian eigenstates, 
i.e.,  solitons, antisolitons and breathers.
These states are uniquely identified 
in terms of mass and rapidity
due to the Fermi-statistics.

The presence of the boundary 
forces two restrictions on the states. 
First, the pair creation at the boundary 
forces the rapidity paired 
and therefore, one can count  positive  
and make energy eigenvalue doubled: 
 
where  is the single particle mass. 


 
pair creation at the boundary  

Second, at the boundary an in-coming soliton is allowed  
to be scattered away as an antisoliton and vice versa
since the soliton number is not conserved in general. 
To take care of this, soliton and antisoliton are regarded 
as a constituent of a doublet 
of identical particles.
When the partition function in Eq. () is 
written in terms of spectral density ,

,
the spectral density should include 
not only one-particle density of 
topological particle (denoted as ) 
(soliton is indistinguishable  from antisoliton)
and its hole density  (),
one-particle density of a breather (),  
its hole  density (  with )
but also should include 
two-particle density of topological particles 
() (i.e.  soliton and antisoliton pair).
The densities are  summarized in the table:

   
 particle species and the corresponding densities.  

Then the free energy density can be written as 
R f_ (R) =  _0^ 
d  
_A=0 ^n_b   _A   
( 2m_A - _ab ^A () )
+ _d ( 2 m_d

,

where  and  is the entropy density,

The boundary scattering amplitude 
(modulo CDD-type factors),
can be found in, which 
satisfies the boundary version of the Yang

( x  
+1 2 +k-2l-1 2 )  ,
where the notation  stands for 
 (x)=( u 2 +x 2 )  
( u 2 -x 2 )  .
The hole and the particle densities are not independent each other. 
This relation is obtained from the 
bulk scattering amplitude. 
The bulk-scattering amplitude of solitons and antisolitons 
 are given as 
S^++ _++ (u )&=& S_- ^- (u)= s( u)


S^+- _+- (u)&=& S_-+ ^-+ (u)= 
(u) ((-u)) s(u)


S^-+ _+- (u) &=& S_-+ ^+- (u)= 
() ((-u)) s(u) 
 

where  is given as  
s(u) =  
-^ _l=1 
[ (2(l-1)u  )
(2l+1-u  ) 
((2l-1)-u  )
((2l-1)+1-u  ) /(u-u)] 
Due to the restriction of  ,
the bulk scattering amplitudes are diagonal,
. 
This restriction makes our analysis 
not too much complicated.  
The diagonal scattering amplitude for soliton and antisoliton 
turns out to be equal up to a phase difference:
.

The scattering amplitude of the breathers  and  
with  takes the form
S^a b (u)=a+b-1a+b-3a-b+3a-b+1,
where the notation  is defined as 
y=( y+1 2 ) (
y-1 2 )  ( y+1 2 -1)
( y-1 2 +1)  
and satisfies the relations
 and .
The scattering amplitude of the soliton (antisoliton) and breather  

is given as  
S^(a) (u) =a-1+a-3+
  . 
where we followed the notation in.

Demanding the wave function periodic in 
we have the constraints between 
hole densities with particle densities.
For soliton states ()

Massless TBA for boundary sine-Gordon model  


The massless TBA corresponding to bSG action 
Eq. () is obtained 
by taking the limit  
of the massive TBA in Eq. (,). 
Even though the soliton mass  vanishes,
one may introduce a finite renormalized mass scale   as

if a large parameter  is defined as 
e^-_0  =  (C_0 )^+1 2   /M_R ,

C_0=  (b^2)  
(
(b^2 2-2 b^2 )  
  (1 2-2 b^2 )   
)^2/(+1) .
In this limit, the rapidity is rescaled 
into renormalized one, 
as .
The boundary scattering parameter,  
is also rescaled as  
maintaining a relation
.
Then  is written in terms of the action parameters,  

(m_R)^b^2   
e^b^2 _R    
=  2_B C_0 (b^2 )   .
On the other hand,  is not rescaled but is identified as 
b^2  = 
 
.
This identification is justified 
from the numerical analysis later on.

In terms of this rescaled parameter 
(we omit hereafter the subscript  
standing for the renormalized one)
the solitonic boundary scattering amplitudes are given as 
K(,,u) 

(  ) 
e^ -i 3 / 4    k(u) 
where  and 


,
and the breather boundary reflection amplitudes are given as 
K^(k) (, , u)  
_l=0 ^k-1 
 (12(u - 
i 
- 2 - k-2l -1 2 ))  
(12(u - i  + 2 - k-2l -1 2 ))   
The boundary  is given as
^0_  &=& 2   
e^(_+_ 2 - )  
+ e^-(_
+_ 2 - )  
  k_(u)  k_(u) ,


^d_  &=&

+e^-(_-- i/2 )  



&&
 
e^(_-+i/2 )  
+ e^-(_-+ i/2 )   
  
( k_(u)   k_(u) )^2
From this massless scattering data 
the massless TBA has the form  
_A'  &=&
D_A' -12 _ B'   
 _- ^d 
_A' B' (-
L_B'  (,


&=& 
D_A'  
+ _B'   I_A'B'  
K* (L_B'   +_B'  -D_A' ),
where  
and the soliton mass  in  
is replaced by the renormalized mass .
The free energy is given as 
Rf(R) = - 12  _- ^d _A=0,1,, n_b  m_A   e^ L_A ().
Let us investigate the parametric dependence of 
the ground state energy 
Eq. () using the TBA Eq. ().
When  the boundary contribution is given 
explicitly as, 
^0_  &=&

Modified TBA shows the correct behavior (in stars)
for  (sold) and  (dashed).   



We note that the boundary contribution 
 in 
Eq. () is -periodic 
in  and other 's are 
 independent.  This explains the 
-periodic in  in Fig. .
(Generally,  will be 
- periodic in ).

However, the periodicity of the energy in  
is not acceptable as pointed out in.
When , the boundary term in the Lagrangian 
effectively changes the relative sign; one can 
equivalently put  
and  while .
This relative sign change of the boundary term
should be reflected in the  value. 
The same problem of  due to  
the periodicity of a boundary parameter 
was also observed in boundary Lee-Yang model.

To cure this disease it has been proposed inthat excited state contributions should be properly taken care of.  
According to this proposal, the   is recalculated 
and is presented in Fig.  when .

In the analysis for  two things are considered: 
First, one needs to find the zeroes of  
in terms of 
the complex rapidity  followingwith the parameter identification in Eq. ().

1 + ^0_  
e^- _0 ( )  
+ ^d_  
e^-2_0 ( )  =0.
The complex rapidity is of the form  
 
with  real.
Second, the free energy should incorporate this branch singularity
into the contour integration and becomes
Rf(R) = -im_0 e^ 
- 12  _- ^d  m_0 e^ L_0().
We generalize this result into the case  is a positive integer.
Excited state contribution is taken for .
We give here how to modify  TBA for all parameter range,
. 

The excited state contribution should be obtained 
from the zeroes of :
1 + ^0_  e^- _0 ( )  
+ ^d_  e^-2_0 ( )  =0,
with the rapidity  
and  real. 
This solution will contribute to the free energy:
Rf(R) = -im_0 e^ 
- 12  _- ^d _A=0,1,, n_b  m_A   
e^ L_A().
The TBA in Eq. () is accordingly  modified: 
_A'  &=& d_A' + S_A'0 (-) 
-12  _B'=0,1,, n_b,+  
_- ^d 
_A'B' (-L_B' (

&=& d_A' + S_A'0 (-) 
+ _B'   I_A'B'  
K* (L_B'  +_ B'  -d_B' ).
Here we use the branch-cut information in 
the original TBA, Eq. ();
_A0 * L () &=& 
-12  d_A0  (-
L(


&&   S_A0  (- ) 
-12  _P d_A0  (-
L(
where  represents the principle value of the integration.   

The consistency of the branch-cut solution  
requires 
_0()
=  e^  
+  i ( 1-(-1)^n_b  2 ) (  2 )
-  _B'=0,1,, n_b  
_0 B' * L_B' () .
A special care has been done for :
S_00  () 
= 12  S_++  ()  S_+-  () 
=12 (-1)^n_b  S_++ ^2()  ,
which accounts for the phase difference of the scattering 
amplitude of soliton and antisoliton. 

We give the numerical result for  case.

Conclusion  

We analyzed the massless (R-channel) TBA  for the boundary
sine-Gordon theory with coupling parameter 
 positive integer.  
The violation of the topological charge is 
incorporated into the analysis and 
the boundary effect on the effective central charge is investigated. 
Modifying the massless TBA 
using the excited state contribution
(the same is also expected for the massive case),
we obtain the right behavior of the ground state energy.  
In this way, we also confirm the parameter identification
of the boundary action parameters with 
the scattering amplitude parameters 
for the massless case.   

From the parametric dependence of the energy,
one can confirm the exact behavior of Josephson current 
I() = 2 e   
E_0 (_b ^(1)  ,_b ^(2) ,) 
as expected in 
which accounts for the Andreev scattering.

Even though in our analysis the coupling parameter 
 is restricted to 
a positive integer, the  should behave
the same way for arbitrary coupling constant.  
However, the TBA of massless/massive
boundary sine-Gordon theory with arbitrary coupling 
is not feasible at this moment 
when the bulk Hamiltonian eigenstates are used
because  this will result in the infinitely 
coupled TBA equations. 
Instead of this approach,  
DDV type equation is expected to be more suitable,
which does not impose string hypothesis 
for the structure of the roots of Bethe ansatz
. 
Further investigation 
will be carried on this arbitrary coupling cases 
and also on the scale dependence as well as 
parametric dependence of the massive TBA 
in a separate paper.

Finally, it is noted that 
the sign change effect of the boundary term 
of boundary Liouville theory 
and boundary sinh-Gordon model 
 can be explained 
using the analytically continued boundary parameter. 
On the other hand, 
integrable boundary ADE-affine Toda theories 
has discrete boundary conditions,
(+), (-) and Neumann condition.
Among the three, (-) boundary condition
is not yet fully understood.
It remains to be seen that
the relative sign change of the boundary term
 will induce 
the exicted state contribution to .
