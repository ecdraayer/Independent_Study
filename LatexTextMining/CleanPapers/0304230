We study the BRST quantization of bosonic and NSR
strings propagating in  backgrounds. The
no-ghost theorem is proved  using the
Frenkel-Garland-Zuckerman method. Regular and spectrally-flowed
representations of affine  appear on an equal footing. Possible
generalizations to related curved backgrounds are discussed.

Introduction 
The BRST quantization of gauge theories was first applied to
string theory in, where a proof of the no-ghost theorem
was given in the BRST context. Once the physical space was identified with the cohomology
of the BRST operator at a particular ghost number, the cohomology itself
is built more or less explicitly,
in order to show that it does not contain states of negative norm.
In particular, in it was shown that, for strings in flat space, physical states
can be isometrically identified with the excitations in
the light-cone gauge.


In Frenkel, Garland and Zuckerman (FGZ) presented a
technically simple but conceptually deep new proof of the no-ghost
theorem in the BRST context, which relies heavily on the fact that the relative 
BRST cohomology(The relative BRST cohomology is defined imposing the additional constraints
 to the BRST cohomolgy (for fermionic strings in the Ramond sector, also  ). See Appendix A.) 
at non-zero momentum
is concentrated at one ghost number(As shown in(and in for the NSR string), the cohomology
of the full  BRST complex at nonzero momentum  consists of two isomorphic copies at consecutive ghost numbers.) ,
a result known as the "vanishing theorem".
Once the latter holds(It should be noted
that the vanishing theorem
does not hold in less conventional settings.
For example, the BRST analysis of 2D gravity
coupled to  matter shows that physical states
are distributed through several ghost numbers.) , the proof of the no-ghost theorem is reduced
to showing the equality between the  traces of two operators (the method was discussed in).
The power of the FGZ method lies on its economy: it probes the
unitarity of the physical sector without explicitly
building it.
The method was applied
to bosonic strings in,
to NRS strings in,
to   backgrounds inand to  backgrounds in.

The FGZ proof of the vanishing theorem and its NSR extensions in,
use techniques of homological algebra
and do not depend on the details of the chiral algebra of
the matter conformal
field theory (CFT).
The only assumption needed is that the matter CFT should be an -free
Virasoro module(This means that the Hilbert space of the chiral CFT
can be expressed as a direct sum of spaces, each of which is built by the
action of Virasoro  operators on a Virasoro highest-weight state, such that
states with different  content are linearly independent.
In the superconformal case, the operators  should be included.
The importance of this condition can be seen in a hand-waving way as follows.
Since the  BRST charge  is built out of the Virasoro modes only (and knows nothing about the
worldsheet chiral algebra),
certain homological statements about  (such as the vanishing theorem), can  be proved
when a basis for the space upon which  acts, can itself be obtained from Virasoro modes only.) .
For flat space worldsheet CFT, the latter was shown in.

In this work we will apply the FGZ method to bosonic and NSR strings propagating in
 backgrounds. Here  is a compact unitary CFT,
with the necessary central charge for  the worldsheet CFT to be critical.
These vacua are relevant in the context of the  correspondence.
In the  case, the infinite modes of  the two-dimensional (super)conformal algebras
in the dual boundary CFT can be constructed explicitly
(see and references therein).


The vanishing theorem holds in  vacua,
because the worldsheet CFT is an -free Virasoro module,
as shown in for regular  representations and
infor the spectrally flowed cases(For fermionic strings, refs. consider only the
NS sector. The results can be easily extended to the R sector.
Alternatively, one can consider the  backgrounds as
a particular case of the backgrounds studied in,
the timelike  current being the  current of  .
But since the whole  CFT is an
-free Virasoro module,
the new filtration introduced in (which
considers only the timelike ,  CFT), is not strictly necessary.) .



As in the  vacua studied in,
 is a nontrivial setting to see the
BRST quantization at work since, due to the absence of
a lightcone direction in ,
we cannot identify the action of the ghost degrees of freedom as annihilating
the "transversal" string excitations.


The unitarity puzzles posed by string theory in  backgroundswere settled in the old covariant quantization (OCQ) formalism
in. It was shown there that physical states belong
to the  coset, modulo spurious states. This reduces the problem to the unitarity of the
coset representations, which was proved in andfor the bosonic and fermionic cases, respectively. Coset unitarity requires a bound for the
the spin of the discrete representations of . This bound is rather ubiquitous, and we discuss it in Section 3.1.
As we show in Section 4, one important point in which the OCQ formalism differs from the FGZ approach,
is that for fermionic NRS strings, in the FGZ proof there is no need for the unitarity
of the supersymmetric   coset, the bosonic results
of  being sufficient.
A different approach to string unitarity in  has been advocated in.




Both in the OCQ and  FGZ approaches, the general results do not hold when ,
since the matter CFT is no longer an -free module.
The unitarity of physical states must then be checked by hand(This is similar to the zero-momentum states in flat space.) .
These exceptional cases have been already studied in for
different representations, and will not be considered here.



The plan of this work is as follows.
In Section 2 we
review the string spectrum in .
In Section 3 we review the Hodge theory of the string BRST complex,
which is an elegant and clear setting in which to formulate
the FGZ method, which we do in Section 3.1.
In Section 4 we calculate all the traces needed to prove the no-ghost theorem
for the different representations.
Finally, in Section 5 we discuss possible generalizations to other curved backgrounds.
In Appendix A we summarize the essentials of the BRST formalism needed in this work.
Appendices B and C are devoted to technical points
used in the body of the paper. We work in the holomorphic sector.
For closed strings, a similar antiholomorphic copy should be considered.


The affine  theory 
The bosonic algebra 
The space  is the universal cover of the group manifold , so the action
of a string moving in an  background is an  WZW model. The symmetry
algebra is the affine  algebra at level  (), generated by three currents  satisfying the OPEs
opeads 
J^3(z) J^3(w) &  -k/2 (z-w)^2  , J^+(z) J^-(w) &  k (z-w)^2  + 2 J^3(w) z-w ,J^3(z) J^ (w) &   J^ (w) z-w .
  
Using the Sugawara construction, the stress tensor is
sugawara 
T^   = 1k-2  12   (J^+J^- + J^+J^- -2J^3J^3 ) .
 
and its modes close a Virasoro algebra with central charge .
Expanding the currents in modes as
modos 
J^3, (z)= _n Z   J^3, _n z^n+1  ,
 
the current algebra  can be written as
comm 

[J^3_n, J^3_m ]    &= - k 2  n _n+m,0  ,          [J^3_n, J^_m ]  &= J^_n+m  ,          [J^+_n , J^-_m ]   &= -2J^3_n+m  + kn_n+m,0 ,
  
with all other commutators vanishing.

The highest weight representations of  and 
are built starting from
unitary representations of the  Lie algebra  .
These are characterized by the eigenvalues
of the Casimir operator , which
will be denoted by  , and the states within each representation are labelled by
the eigenvalue of , which will be denoted by .
These representations are the primary states for the current algebra.
They are annihilated by ,
and the Fock space of states is
built by acting on them with .

The unitary representations of the  Lie algebra 
which appear in the spectrum of strings moving in an  background are:

 
Highest weight discrete representations 

where  is annihilated by  and  is a  real number such that
.

Lowest weight discrete representations 

where  is annihilated by  and  is a  real number such that
.

Continuous representations 

where  and , where  is a real number.


The  bounds for   appearing for 
can be understood in terms of consistency conditions for the primary states.
The lower bound, ,  is necessary for the normalizability
of the primary states when their norm is interpreted as the 
inner product of functions in the  group manifold .
Regarding the upper bound, , in it was noted that it is necessary
for the unitarity of the primary states, when their
norm is interpreted as the two-point function
of the vertex operators creating them from the vacuum.
Moreover, adopting either the upper or the lower bound for , the other one
appears when imposing the  spectral flow (see below) to be a symmetry of the spectrum.
Finally, the compelling evidence for the correctness of these bounds on  comes from
the fact that only this range of  appears in the spectrum
of the thermal partition function of the model, computed by
path integral techniques in.

In the computations of Section 4, we will be interested in the characters
of the representations, which are very easy to obtain
because  the action of the  modes
is free for the representations considered.
For  we have
card 
_j^+(q,z)=_j ^+  ( q^L_0  z^J_0^3  )
= &  q^- j(j-1) k-2   z^j ^ _n=1 (1-q^n)(1-q^n-1 z)(1-q^nz^-1 )  , = &  q^- j(j-1) k-2 + 18  z^j - 12  i_1(q,z) .
  
Eq. should be understood as a formal series expansion
which converges to  
 when . The elliptic
function  isthetauno 

_1(q,z)= & -i z^-1/2 q^1/8 _n=1 ^ (1-q^n)(1-q^n-1 z)(1-q^nz^-1 ), = & -i _n Z   (-1)^n z^n-1/2  q^(n-1/2)^2 2  .
  
For the  representations, the character is
carc 
 _j=1/2+is, (q,z)=__j=1/2+is,   ( q^L_0  z^J_0^3  )=
 q^s^2 + 1/4 k-2  ^ _n=1 (1-q^n)^3 
_n Z  z^+n  .
 
The character of  can be obtained from the spectral flow of  (see below).



 decomposition and spectral flow 
It will be convenient to decompose both the
currents and the spectrum into the direct product of a
parafermionic  model and the timelike  model
corresponding to .
For the currents , this can be performed by representing
them as
decomp 
J^3(z) = & - k 2  X(z) ,J^ (z) = & ^ (z) e^2k  X  ,
  
with
equis 
X(z)X(w) &  -(z-w) ,X(z) ^ (w) &  0 .
  

Note that the field  is antihermitian, in order for   to be hermitian
and .
The fields  form an   parafermionic theory introduced in,
and are a non-minimal generalization of the  parafermions of.
The OPEs of  can be read from  and .


The stress tensor is similarly decomposed into
stressdeco 
T^   = T^/U(1)   + T^U(1)  ,
 
with
stressuno 
T^U(1)  = - 1k J^3J^3 .
 
The decomposition can also be performed on the representations.
Indeed, every representation  gives rise
to an infinite number of parafermionic representations  with
.
The  Hilbert spaces can be decomposed into
decompo 

j ^+  & = _n   Z   _j,n  j+n  , j,  & = _n   Z    _j,+n  +n  ,
  
where  is a highest-weight representation of the timelike current  with
 eigenvalue . The  representations
are built by acting with the modes of  on parafermionic highest-weight states.
The reader can find details in.
We will be mainly interested in their characters, which are
carpf 

_j,n (q) & =__j,n    q^L_0  =
q^- j(j-1) k-2  + (j+n)^2 k  _n=1 ^ (1-q^n)^2  ^ _s=0 (-1)^s q^12 s(s+2n+1)   ,  _j,+n (q)&= _ _j,+n    q^L_0  =
q^- j(j-1) k-2  + (+n)^2 k  _n=1 ^ (1-q^n)^2  .
  
In Appendix A we show explicitly that the decompositions  are, in terms of the characters,
cardeco 
^+_j(q,z) & = _n   Z   z^j+n   _j,n (q) _j+n (q) ,  _j=1/2+is, (q,z) & = _n   Z   z^+n    _j,+n (q) _+n (q) ,
  
where
pfuno 
_m (q)_m   ( q^L_0  ) = q^-m^2 k   ^ _n=1 (1-q^n)  .
 








































Now, given any integer , the algebra  is preserved by the
spectral flow 
 defined by
flow  
J _n^3 & = J_n^3 - k 2  w _n,0   , J _n^& = J_n w ^.
  
This transformation maps   to
flowele 
L _0= L_0 + wJ^3_0 - k 4w^2 .
 
The spectral flow can be
implemented in   by
flowx  X(z) X (z)=X(z) + w k 2   z ,
 
and leaving the
parafermions  untouched. For ,
the symmetry  maps the  representation
into .
Note that under this mapping the upper and lower bounds of  are interchanged.
Including the  spectrally flowed states, we can just consider  representations.

For generic ,  it was shown in
 that  the Hilbert space  is mapped into new
representations which must be included in a consistent description
of a string propagating in . The way to include these
representations is to take usual representations 
for flowed operators ,
and measure their quantum numbers with unflowed .
Alternatively, instead of this active  procedure, we can use a passive  one,
and obtain the flowed sectors by acting with the unflowed
operators  on flowed primaries. Starting with an  vertex operator
vertex 
_j,m = _j,m   e^m 2k  X  ,
 
where  is a parafermionic primary, the flowed vertex operator
is obtained applying to it the mapping , yielding
vertexflow 
_j,m ^w = _j,m  
e^(m+wk/2) 2k  X  .
 






Note that for  representations, all the excited physical states
belong to flowed sectors.
This can be seen from the mass-shell
condition,
capademasa 
L_0=14 + s^2 k-2  -w(+ n) + kw^2 4  + N + h^  - 1 =0 ,
 
where  is a highest weight of the inner theory and N is the level. It is
clear that for , eq.  can only be satisfied if .

The characters of the flowed  representations are
cardf 
^w_j(q,z)= & _j ^w  ( q^L_0  z^J_0^3  )
= _j ^+  ( q^L _0-wJ ^3_0-kw^2/4   z^J _0^3+kw/2  ) ,=&  q^-kw^2/4  z^kw/2   _j ^+  ( q^L _0   (zq^-w )^J _0^3  ), = &  (-1)^w q^[- j(j-1) k-2  - (k-2)w^2 4  -(2j -1)w 2  + 18 ]  
z^[j + (k-2)w 2  - 12]  i_1(q,z)  .
  
where we have used the propertypete 
_1(q,zq^-w )=(-1)^w q^-w^2/2 z^w _1(q,z) .
 
For the  representations we obtain similarly
carcf 
 ^w_j=1/2+is, (q,z)= &   _j, ^w  ( q^L_0  z^J_0^3  ), = &   q^s^2 + 1/4 k-2 -kw^2/4 -w  ^ _n=1 (1-q^n)^3 
_n Z  z^+n+ kw/2 q^-wn  .
  

As is clear from , the effect of the spectral flow is to
"dislocate" the parafermionic and the  quantum numbers by an amount .
The decompositions  are generalized to
decompoflow 

j ^w  & = _n   Z   _j,n  j+n+kw/2  ,j, ^w  & = _n   Z    _j,+n  +n+kw/2  .
  
In Appendix C we show explicitly that, in terms of the characters, the decompositions  are
cardecof 
^w_j(q,z) & = _n   Z   z^j+n+ kw/2   _j,n (q) _j+n+kw/2 (q) , ^w_j=1/2+is, (q,z) & = _n   Z   z^+n+ kw/2    _j,+n (q) _+n+kw/2 (q) .
  







The supersymmetric algebra 
For fermionic strings in , we should consider
the current algebra of affine supersymmetric  at level k. It is generated by three
dimension-  supercurrents  ,
whose modes satisfy
commfer 

[J^3_n, J^3_m ]    &= - k 2  n _n+m,0  ,           [J^3_n, J^_m ]  &= J^_n+m  ,          [J^+_n , J^-_m ]   &= -2J^3_n+m  + kn_n+m,0  ,       [J^3_n, ^_m]&=^_n+m  ,      [J^_n,^_m]&=2^3_n+m  ,      [J^_n, ^3_m]&=^_n+m  ,       ^3_n,^3_m &= -k 2  _n+m,0 ,        ^+_n,^-_m &= k _n+m,0  ,
  
with all other (anti)commutators vanishing.
The modding of  is integer and that of  half-integer (Neveu-Schwarz) or integer (Ramond).
The worldsheet CFT is supersymmetric,
the Sugawara stress tensor and the supercurrent being
tensorT 
 T^  &=1 2k [j^+j^- +j^-j^+] - 1 k j^3j^3 -1
2k [^+ ^- + ^- ^+] +1
k ^3 ^3  ,G^  &=1 k  [^+j^- +
^-j^+] -2 k ^3j^3 - 2 k^2 
^+^-^3 .
  
As usual, purely bosonic currents can be defined by
bosonicJ 
 j^a &= J^a - J ^a ,        J ^a &= -i k  f^a_ bc  ^b ^c .
  
The  form an affine  bosonic algebra at level .
The  and the  form a supersymmetric affine  algebra
at level  which commutes with . The spectrum
of the theory is the direct product of the Hilbert spaces of both theories.
In the bosonic sector, the reprentations are the ones considered above.
For the  currents, we have the usual representations for free fermions, for
both Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond sectors. The spectral flow can be also defined
in the  theory, but it just amounts
to a rearrangement of the usual spectrum, as shown in .










The Hodge theory of the BRST complex 
The formalism reviewed below was developed in,
and can be found in.
For similar results in the context of compact Lie algebras, see.

We will denote by  the Hilbert space composed of the ghost plus matter sectors, with the restriction
, and also   for fermionic strings in the Ramond sector.
Although  is infinite dimensional
(due to the infinite degeneracy of the base states of the  representations), it can be decomposed into
efesuma 
= _m  (m) ,
 
where each subspace  has  and is finite dimensional.
In the following, we will consider each  space separately, although
we will keep the notation .


The space  has a natural grading under  as
sumag 
= _g Z   _g ,
 
where  has ghost number .
The action induced by  in each  will de denoted by
qun 
Q_g: _g _g+1  ,
 
and the following sequence is a graded complex
secuencia 
  _g-1  ssQ_g-1    _g  Q_g   _g+1  
.
 
For each  we define the kernel and the image of  as
kerima 

Ker  Q_g & = _g    Q =0  , Im  Q_g & =  Q   _g  .
  
The cohomology of  in  is then defined as
defcoho 
_g _g ,
 
with
defcohog 
_g =  Ker  Q_g Im  Q_g-1   .
 
Since the indefinite inner product in   is non-degenerate,
an orthogonal basis in  can be constructed.
Let us define the action of a linear hermitian operator  on the states of such a  basis
as   if the state has positive (negative) norm.
Then for any pair of states  the inner product
inprodc 
      ,
 
is clearly positive definite.
The latter implies that  maps  into 
because the antihermitian character of  implies that
two states can have nonzero  inner product only if they have opposite ghost number.
Indeed,  interchanges the  and the  modes
of any state (and the  and  for fermionic strings), as we show explicitly
in Appendix B. Moreover, this mapping from  to  is a
linear isomorphism because each  is finite dimensional
and  has empty kernel because . Note that the action of  is
similar to the action of the Hodge  operator on p-forms.

Under this new inner product  is no longer hermitian,
but its conjugate  can be obtained from
qconj 
 Q  =  Q   = Q   = Q^*   ,
 
where we have used ,  so we have . From its definition it is clear that
 and that  carries ghost number  and is hermitian under .
As for , we will denote by  the action of  on .

The positive definiteness of  allows us to decompose  both as
decouno 
_g = Im Q_g-1  ( Im Q_g-1  )^  ,
 
and as
decodos 
_g = Im Q^*_g+1  ( Im Q^*_g+1  )^  ,
 
where  means orthogonal with respect to .
But, as can be easily checked, we have 
and .
Applying now the decomposition  to   we have
decoker 
Ker Q_g  = Im Q_g-1  _g ,
 
where we have defined
hache 
_g = Ker Q_g Ker Q^*_g .
 
The elements of    provide us with a  unique representative
for each cohomology class . Indeed, from   we
see that the elements of  are annihilated by , and two representatives
of the same class of
 always differ by an element belonging entirely to
the first term of . Moreover, it is easy to check (using that  is positive definite)
that a state belongs to  iff it is harmonic , i.e., it is annihilated by the Laplacian 
laplace 
Q Q^* + Q^* Q .
 
Inserting now  into  we obtain the Hodge decomposition 
hodge 
_g = Im Q_g-1  Im Q^*_g+1  _g .
 
It is easy to check that the isomorphism between  and  provided by
 acts on the terms of  as
mapeos 
:  & Im Q_g Im Q^*_-g  ,:  & _g _-g  ,
  
and from the second line of  we find that the
cohomologies  and  are isomorphic, a result known
as Poincare duality .


Now, it is clear that
dim 
_g = Q_g + Q_g ,
 
and from  we have , which implies
dimdos 
_g = _g + Q_g + Q_g-1  .
 
Performing an alternating sum of  over all , the last two terms cancel pairwise and we obtain
the Euler-Poincare identity :
eulerpoincare 
_g (-1)^g _g = _g (-1)^g _g .
 

The FGZ proof of the no-ghost theorem 
The physical space of states is defined to be the  cohomology in .
Since the latter is concentrated at zero ghost number,
it can be identified with , and
the no-ghost theorem asserts that states in  have positive norm under the
usual inner product .


Note that  from the second line of  we see that  maps  to itself,
so it can be diagonalized
in  with eigenvalues  or  (because ), corresponding to states
with positive or negative  norm, respectively.
Calling   to the number of
  eigenvalues, we have
des 
_0 N_+ - N_- = __0 ,
 
and it is clear that the no-ghost theorem is proved iff the equality in  holds.


The centrality of the vanishing theorem
comes now to the fore, since
having   implies, through the Euler-Poincare identity ,
epdual 
_g  (-1)^g _g = _g  (-1)^g _g = _0 ,
 
where  is the Euler index  of the BRST complex.
As for , notice that the isomorphism  under  between
 and  implies
trazanula 
_   Q_-1  Q^*_1       = 0 ,
 
so from  we have
trazaefecero 
__0 = __0 .
 
Similarly, the isomorphism under  between  and 
implies for  that
trazanulados 
_   _g  _-g       = 0 ,
 
and from this we obtain
sign 
_  = _ _g _g    = __0 ,
 
where  is the signature  of the BRST complex. Putting  -  together,
the no-ghost theorem is equivalent to the identity
nog 
= .
 





No-ghost theorem for strings in  
We will prove the identity  by comparing
see 
(q,z) =  &  (q^L_0  z^J_0^3 ) , (q,t)  =  & ((-1)^N_g  q^L_0  z^J_0^3 ) ,
  
where the traces will be taken over the different representations.
Note that for our purposes the formal expansions in  and  are of very different nature.
Because of the mass shell condition , in the expansion in  we are only
interested in the term independent of q.(Note that the condition  (and ) is already taken into account
by just ignoring the degeneracy of the ghost vacuum in the traces .) 
On the other hand, we need all the powers of , since the decomposition 
was only done  in order to separate  into finite-dimensional subspaces.

In the computation of , we will use the fact that the trace is multiplicative
under tensor products and additive under direct sums.
We will consider representations with arbitrary flow parameter , which of
course include the regular representations ().


Bosonic strings 
In it was shown that  representations coming from
 representations with , and those coming from  with ,
are unitary.
Since these bounds are satisfied in our case, the only
source of negative norms are the modes of .
The action of  in the  sector should clearly be
accionc 
^ (z) & = ^ (z) , J^3_-n  & = -J^3_-n  .
  

We decompose  into
decfb 
(b,c)  _  _  ,
 
and we further decompose the representations of  as in The signature of the  representations can now be computed as
signatura 
_j ^w  (q,z)
 =    _(b,c) (q)  _n   Z   z^j+n+kw/2   __j,n  (q)  _j+n+kw/2  (q) _ (q) .
 
The traces in  can be computed as follows.
In the ghost sector, using the decomposition (), we have
signabc 
_(b,c) (q) = _(b,c)  (q^L_0  )= q^-1  _n=1 ^ (1-q^n)(1+q^n) .
 
The signature of the timelike  is easily found from  to be
signau 
_j+n+kw/2  (q)=Tr _U _j+n+kw/2   C  q^L_0   = q^-(j+n+kw/2)^2 k   _n=1 ^ (1+q^n)  .
 
Since the theories  and  are unitary, their signature is their character.
So from - the total signature is then
signais 
_j ^w  (q,z) =
q^-1   ^ _n=1 (1-q^n) _n   Z   q^(j+n+kw/2) k ^2 
z^j+n+kw/2  _j,n (q)
.
 
The index of the  representation is
index 
_j ^w   (q,t)
 = _(b,c) (q)  _j ^w  ( q^L_0  z^J_0^3  )  .
 
In the ghost sector, decomposing  as
ghostdecomdos 
_(b,c)  = _n=1 ^    0 _g, b_-n 0 _g    0 _g, c_-n 0 _g  ,
 
we have
indexbc 
_(b,c) (q)=_(b,c)  ((-1)^N_g  q^L_0  ) = q^-1  ^ _n=1 (1-q^n)^2 ,
 
and the index can be written as
indexis 

_j ^w  =  q^-1  ^ _n=1 (1-q^n)^2  ^w_j(q,z).
 
Finally, the equality between  and  follows immediately from  and .

Proceeding similarly for the  representations, we obtain
sigcon 
__j, ^w & =
q^-1   ^ _n=1 (1-q^n) ^ _n=-  q^(+n+kw/2) k ^2 
z^+n+kw/2   _j,+n (q)
, __j, ^w & =  q^-1  ^ _n=1 (1-q^n)^2   ^w_j, (q,z),
  
and the equality follows again from  and .

Fermionic strings 
For NSR strings, the computation of the traces is greatly simplified
by decomposing the  sector at level  into a purely bosonic 
model at level  and three free fermions  (See Section 3.3).
From , we see that the action of  on the free fermions is
accioncfer 
^a _n = (-1)^_a,3    ^a _n(z) .
 
The total Hilbert space  can then be expressed as
decff 
(b,c)  _(,)  _  _^a  _  .
 
Note that the traces on   can be taken from the
above bosonic computation, including there the fermionic sectors of .
We will compute the traces for  representations, the  case being identical.


Neveu-Schwarz sector 

Using the decomposition (), and , we find
sigbg 
_(,) (q)=_(,)  (q^L_0  )= _r=12 ^  q^12  (1-q^r)(1+q^r)  ,
 
sigpsi 
_^a (q) =_^a  (q^L_0  )=_r=12 ^  (1-q^r)(1+q^r)^2 .
 
The total signature is then,
signs 
^NS (q,z)=_j ^w (q,z)  _(,) (q)  _^a (q)
= q^12  _j ^w (q,z) _r=12 ^  (1+q^r) .
 
To find , we decompose
bgdecdos 
_(,)  = _r=1/2 ^  _N_r=0 ^ 
 ^N_r _-r 0 _g 
_r=1/2 ^  _N_r=0 ^ 
  ^N_r _-r 0 _g  ,
 
and then
indbg 
_(,) (q)=_(,)  ((-1)^N_g  q^L_0  )=_r=12 ^  q^12  (1+q^r)^2  .
 
We also need
indpsi 
_^a  ( q^L_0 )= _r=12 ^  (1+q^r)^3 .
 
So the total index is
indns 
^NS (q,z)=_j ^w (q,z)  _(,) (q)  _^a  ( q^L_0 )
=q^12  _j ^w (q,z) _r=12 ^ (1+q^r) .
 
The equality between  and  follows then from the bosonic results.


Ramond sector 

The traces are computed similarly, giving for the signatures
sigbgr 
_(,) (q)= _r=1 ^  q^3 8  (1-q^r)(1+q^r)  ,
 
sigpsir 
_^a (q)=q^316   _r=1 ^  (1-q^r)(1+q^r)^2 ,
 
and
sigram 
^R (q,z)=_j ^w (q,z)  _(,) (q)  _^a (q)
=q^9 16  _j ^w (q,z) _r=1 ^  (1+q^r) .
 

For the computation of the index, we obtain
indbgr 
_(,) (q)= _r=1 ^  q^3 8   (1+q^r)^2  ,
 
indpsir 
_^a  ( q^L_0 )=q^316   _r=1 ^  (1+q^r)^3 ,
 
and
indram 
^R (q,z)=_j ^w (q,z)  _(,) (q)  _^a  ( q^L_0 )
=q^9 16  _j ^w (q,z) _r=1 ^ (1+q^r) .
 
The equality between  and  follows again from the bosonic results.

Notice that for the computation of  in the fermionic case,
we have relied on the unitarity of the
bosonic  coset, and we did not need the unitarity of the
supersymmetric coset, as in the OCQ. This is related  to
the fact that with the FGZ method we bypass the building of the
physical states themselves, which do belong to the supersymmetric  coset,
modulo spurious states.



Discussion 
The applicability of the FGZ method depends on two points.
The first is expressing (a sector of) the matter chiral algebra as a free -Virasoro
module. This should be checked in each case, although
the techniques ofcan be adapted or adopted for a wide family of backgrounds.

The second point is having enough control over the representations of the
worldsheet CFT, so as to compute the traces .
Based on the results for , several related exact CFT backgrounds
could be dealt with successfully. In particular, the BTZ black hole  (an orbifold of ) and
pp-waves backgrounds, obtained as Penrose limits of 
(see and references therein).

An additional class of related backgrounds are gauged WZW models including an

  factor,
such as the Lorentzian 2D black hole (),
the cosmological Nappi-Witten model ()
and the  generalization of the latter studied in.
These backgrounds are particularly interesting, because although the matter  CFT
(the relative cohomology of the BRST complex in the gauged WZW model)
contains negative-normed states,
it cannot be decomposed as .
Here we can use to advantage the cohomological analysis of
gauged WZW models in, which show that a
vanishing theorem holds in  (for certain subgroups ).
This allows to compute  and  on  by taking the traces
over ,
and following a chain of identities similar to those in  and .
In this way, as we did in this work, the flowed sectors of the  factor in G can be included.
This will be worked out in detail in a future work.

BRST essentials 
We review here the basics of the  and  algebra that we need in this work.
More details can be found in. The zero-mode quantization
has some subtleties, which have been discussed, inter alia , in.


Bosonic strings 
The anticommuting  reparametrization ghosts, with conformal dimensions , have the OPEs
opebc 
b(z)c(w)  & c(z)b(w) 1 z-w  ,b(z)b(w)  & c(z)c(w)  0 .
  
The ghost number operator is defined as
ng 
N_g & = - dz  b(z) c(z) ,     & = _n=1 ^ ( c_-n b_n  - b_-n c_n ) + c_0b_0 - 12 .
  
The ordering constant  can be fixed in several ways,
the most immediate one being the requirement of  being antihermitian,
i.e., . For this we use
.

The charge of the  modes under  is
cargasbc 
[N_g,b_m]= - b_m ,[N_g,c_m]= + c_m .
  
The zero modes  satisfy the Clifford algebra ,
so there is a  double-degenerate vacuum , which satisfies
ghvac 
c_0 & = b_0= ,c_0& = b_0= c_n ,= b_n ,, n>0.

  
On the vacua  we have .
The zero-modes algebra implies that the inner product on the ghost space is consistently defined by
ghinp 
 c_0& =  c_0=1 , c_0& = 0 ,
  
and from this follows the inner product of any exited state.

The BRST charge
brstcharge 
Q = dz  c(z) ( T^M (z) + 12 T^(b,c) (z) ) ,
 
is an hermitian operator which carries ghost number , and  if . Here  is the matter stress tensor.
In this work we consider the restriction to the space  defined by ,
where  is the zero mode of .
This chooses the  vacuum,
which will be denoted . In  we redefine
 to be in  by assigning ghost number  to  and ignoring the last two terms in the expansion .
The action of  is consistent with the restriction to   because .







Fermionic strings 
For  NSR strings, we have, on top of the  system,
the super-reparametrization ghosts , with conformal dimensions  and OPEs
opebg 
(z)(w)  & 1 z-w  , (z)(w)  & -1 z-w  ,(z)(w)  & (z)(w)  0 .
  
The modes of  satisfy
,
where  for the Ramond (Neveu-Schwarz) sector.
In the Ramond sector, the zero modes again make the vacuum double-degenerate.
We choose  in , and denote the selected vacuum also by .
We have then,
vbg 
_r 0 0 _g   = _r>0 0 _g  =0.
 
On , we have  for the Ramond (Neveu-Schwarz) sector.
The  ghost number is zero, and the operator  in  is extended to satisfy
cargasbg 
[N_g,_r]= - _r , [N_g, _r]= + _r .
  
The BRST charge is now
brstchfer 
Q = dz  [ c(z) ( T^M (z) + 12 T^g (z) ) +
(z)( G^M (z) + 12 G^g (z) ) ] ,
 
with  if . Here  is the matter supercurrent,
 and  the supercurrent of the superconformal
combined  systems. The  condition is imposed with .
The space  is again defined by . In the Ramond sector, also by , where
 is the zero mode of  . This
restriction is consistent because .








The action of  in the ghost sector 
In this Appendix we will show that the operator , defined in Section 2, interchanges
between  and  (and  and ) modes, thus
mapping  to .

We can decompose the ghost sector  into
 
where
gemasmenos 
,n  ( b_-n  c_-n )  2   0 _g ,
 
satisfy
gein 
,n  ,m =&  _n,m  , +,n  -,m =&  0 ,
  
so from  we have
cenghost 
c_n & = b_n , b_n & = c_n .
  
For fermionic strings, we use the decomposition
 
where
gemm 
,N_r  ( _-r  _-r )^N_r   2N_r!   0 _g ,
 
satisfy
geimm 
,N_r  ,N_s =&  (1)^N_r  _r,s _N_r,N_s   , +,N_r  -,N_s =&  0 ,
  
so we have
cenghmm 
_r & = (-1)^S(r)  _r , _r & = (-1)^S(r)  _r ,
  
where  equals  if .

 character decomposition 
In this Appendix we will prove explicitly the character decompositions  and .
Let us start with the representation , whose character is
carchi 
^+_j(q,z)=  q^- j(j-1) k-2   z^j ^ _n=1 (1-q^n)(1-q^n-1 z)(1-q^nz^-1 )  .
 
We will use the technique of infinite partial fractions, which has been used in in order
to prove similar identities. Define
efene 
f_N (q,z)= 1  _n=1 ^N  1-q^n-1 z1-q^nz^-1    ,
 
which can be decomposed into partial fractions as
partialefe 
f_N (q,z)=^N_k=1  a_k(q) ( 1 - q^k-1 z )( 1 - q^kz^-1  ) .
 
The coefficients  are
aka 
a_k(q) & = _z q^k  ( 1 - q^k-1 z )(  1 - q^kz^-1  ) f_N (q,z) ,        & =  1 - q^2k-1   _n=k ^N+k-1 (1-q^n)^N_n=1  n k (1-q^n-k )  ,        & = (1-q^2k-1 ) (-1)^k-1  q^k(k-1) 2   ^N+k-1 _n=1 (1-q^n) ^N-k _n=1 (1-q^n)  ,
  
thus for  we have

efelimite 
_N   f_N(q,z) & = 1  _n=1 ^  ( 1-q^n-1 z)(1-q^nz^-1  )  ,  & = 1 ^ _n=1 (1-q^n)^2  
[ _k=1 ^  (1-q^2k-1 )(-1)^k-1  q^k(k-1)
2   (1-q^k-1 z)(1-q^kz^-1 )  ] .
  
The
denominators in the sum of  can be expanded and
resummed as
sumageo 
1 (1-q^k-1 z)(1-q^k z^-1 )  & = ^ _m,n=0  q^m(k-1) z^m q^nk z^-n  , & = 1 (1-q^2k-1 )  [ ^ _n=0  q^n(k-1) 
z^n + ^-1 _n=-  q^-nk  z^n  ] .
  
Thus
 can be written as
efelimitedos 
1  _n=1 ^  ( 1-q^n-1 z)(1-q^nz^-1  )  & =
1 ^ _n=1 (1-q^n)^2     [ ^ _n=0  _k=1 ^  .   z^n (-1)^k-1  & q^12 (k - 2n)(k-1) 
  . +  _n=- ^-1  _k=1+2n ^      z^n (-1)^k-1  q^12 (k - 2n)(k-1) 
] ,
  
where in the second term we have changed the index  to  in order to make the exponents of  be  the same in both terms.
Now, using that for 
sumacero 
_k=1 ^2n   (-1)^k-1  q^12 (k - 2n)(k-1)  = 0 ,
 
and changing the index  to  we obtain finally
igualdadfinal 
1  _n=1 ^  ( 1-q^n-1 z)(1-q^nz^-1  )  =
1  ^ _n=1 (1-q^n)^2  ^ _n=-  ^ _s=0  z^n (-1)^s q^12 s(s+2n+1)  ,
 
and
multiplying both sides by
,
the first line of  follows.

From , we see that the flowed characters can be obtained from  by
replacing , and multiplying the resulting expression by .
So we have,

uedt 
^w_j(q,z)= &
q^- j(j-1) k-2 -kw^2/4   z^kw/2  ^ _n=1 (1-q^n)^3  ^ _n=-  ^ _s=0  (zq^-w )^n+j (-1)^s q^12 s(s+2n+1)  , = &  q^- j(j-1) k-2   z^j+kw/2   ^ _n=1 (1-q^n)^3  ^ _n=-  ^ _s=0 
q^(j+n)^2k -(j+n+kw/2)^2k   z^n
 (-1)^s q^12 s(s+2n+1)  ,
  
and this equality is the first line of .

The decompositions for  representations
are immediate and are left as an exercise.
