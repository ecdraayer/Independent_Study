We consider a blown-up 3-brane, with the resulting geometry 
, in an infinite-volume bulk with  extra
dimensions. The action on the brane includes both an Einstein term and
a cosmological constant. Similar setups have been proposed both to
reproduce 4-d gravity on the brane, and to solve the cosmological
constant problem. Here we obtain a singularity-free solution to
Einstein's equations everywhere in the bulk and on the brane, which
allows us to address these question explicitely. One finds, however,
that the proper volume of  and the cosmological constant on
the brane have to be fine-tuned relatively to each other, thus the
cosmological constant problem is not solved. Moreover the scalar
propagator on the brane behaves 4-dimensionally over a
phenomenologically acceptable range only if the warp factor on the
brane is huge, which aggravates the Weak Scale - Planck Scale
hierarchy problem.

Introduction 

Recently it has been claimed that the cosmological constant problem can
be solved in brane worlds with  infinitely large extra
dimensions with an extra Einstein term localized on the brane
. Then the graviton propagator is soft (massive) beyond
some scale , and consequently the gravitational field
(the FRW scale factor ) does not necessarily "react" to sources
that are smooth at scales  such as a cosmological constant.
The success of the cosmological standard model, on the other hand,
requires  where  is the Hubble constant
today. The setup in assumes a vanishing cosmological constant in
the bulk, which can possibly be motivated by some unbroken
supersymmetry (and -parity) in the bulk. A 4-dimensional behaviour
of gravity, hopefully over a large range of scales, is then due to an
additional Einstein term on the brane [3-5]. The (classical)
brane-to-brane graviton propagator actually suffers from a short
distance singularity for , which requires an UV regularization in
the form of "blowing up" the transverse size of the 3-brane, higher
derivative terms in the bulk or a momentum cutoff [6-12]. A solution of the cosmological constant problem is achieved only if one
includes, in addition, an arbitrary (not fine-tuned) cosmological
constant on the brane. This induces a non-trivial gravitational field
in the bulk surrounding the brane, which generically exhibits a naked
singularity. Again a regularization of this singularity
requires a blowing-up of the brane (or higher
derivative terms). In it has been argued that allowing the brane to inflate
- with a phenomenologically acceptable small acceleration rate -
removes the naked singularity. However, no explicit solution of the
Einstein equations was given, and the proposed scenario supposedly
requires at least fine-tuned initial conditions.In the present paper we present a (singularity free) solution of
Einstein's equation, which corresponds to a blown-up 3-brane in 
extra dimensions. In contrast to smoothed-out branes considered
elsewhere Einstein's equations are satisfied everywhere: Not only in
the bulk for  (where  is the radius of the blown-up
brane) but also for . This is made possible through a
particular choice for the profile function , which describes the
distribution of the brane tension as a function of  (which was
concentrated at  originally): We assume that the complete brane
tension (i.e. the brane cosmological constant) is concentrated at the
surface  of the blown-up brane, i.e. 
. The shape of the brane in the  extra dimensions is then the
one of a sphere . Although the distribution of the brane
tension is still -function-like in the radial direction, this
does not imply a singular gravitational field in the bulk (or on the
brane) since one has just an effective co-dimension one problem. A similar setup has already been considered in. In
, however, the metric in the bulk "inside" the sphere (for
) was assumed to be constant, and no consistent solution to
the junction conditions could be found.Here we take instead, for , a copy of the known metric
"outside" after an inversion . This
configuration has a  symmetry: Changing the radial coordinate from
 to  by  our setup is invariant under a
reflection at ; the surface of  is situated at .
Now the notions "inside" and "outside" have actually lost their
meaning, since the space "inside" is just a copy of the space
"outside" and shares with it its infinite volume. Nevertheless this corresponds to a regularization ("blowing-up") of
an infinitely thin 3-brane: Fields living on the brane with its world
volume  (where  is our
4-dimensional Minkowski space) just see the finite world volume of
 of  independently from the infinite
volumes "inside" and "outside", and their Kaluza-Klein modes on
 become infinitely heavy for . Since we have explicit singularity-free solutions of Einstein's
equations and junction conditions, we can ask whether the brane can
support an arbitrary tension (cosmological constant) without inflation,
i.e. without a naked singularity in the static case. It turns out,
however, that the brane tension and the volume of the blown-up brane
have to be relatively fine-tuned. This follows from the mere number of
junction conditions to be satisfied, hence we have all reasons to
believe that this result is generic and independent from the particular
setup considered here (a profile function concentrated on the
boundary). The Einstein term on the brane does not play a particular
role for this result, it just modifies the required relation between
the brane tension and its volume on . Next we can ask whether the gravitational propagator on the brane
behaves 4-dimensionally over a phenomenologically acceptable range of
scales or momenta . To this end we study the scalar propagator on
the brane in the present gravitational background, with coefficients of
the kinetic terms in the bulk and on the brane identical to the ones of
the Einstein terms. This does not yet allow us to study the tensor
structure of the graviton propagator, but a 
behaviour of the scalar propagator over a large range of  is
already a necessary condition for an acceptable behaviour of gravity.
The result is that, one the one hand, a  behaviour of the 
scalar propagator over a phenomenologically acceptable range is
possible, for a certain range of values of the gravitational constant
 in the -dimensional bulk and the volume of .
However, for the corresponding values of these parameters the warp
factor  on the brane is huge:
A > 10^15 N-1 N + 2     .
This behaviour of the warp factor is opposite to the one proposed in
 as a solution to the Weak Scale - Planck Scale hierarchy 
problem. A scenario with many infinite  extra dimensions, and 4-d
gravity due to an (induced) Einstein term on the brane, is thus a
priori difficult to realize.On the other hand recall that, for a 4-dimensional behaviour of gravity
over a phenomenologically acceptable range, the setup in [2] requires
(for )

( M_Pl  M_D  )  > 10^30   .
Here we find that the required hierarchy between the 
gravitational constants  and  is less dramatic, if one
allows the proper volume of  to be as small as
 (instead of ): Then a  behaviour of
the propagator over a phenomenologically acceptable range
requires only

( M_Pl  M_D  )^N+2   > 10^30  
which, for  large, is easier to realize than eq. ().
In the next section we present our setup more explicitly, and solve the
combined Einstein equations in the bulk and junction conditions on the
blown-up brane. The existence of static singularity-free
(non-supersymmetric) -brane configurations in -dimensions,
with  dimensions of the brane compactified on , is
quite remarkable in view of the naked singularities encountered
generally and the negative result in. As noted
above, however, a relative fine-tuning of the input parameters is
required, thus the cosmological constant problem is not solved. In Section III we study the scalar propagator in this background.
Although the full problem (the corresponding wave equation for all
non-zero modes) cannot be solved explicitely, the partial
results in can be used here as well and allow to obtain the
essential features of the -dependence of the propagator. Then we
derive the phenomenological constraints on the input parameters cited
above and conclude.


Singularity Free Blown-up p-Branes 

The original scenario consists in an infinitely thin 3-brane in a 
 dimensional bulk, i.e. with  extra dimensions. Our
conventions for coordinates and indices are: , 
, are the coordinates of flat Minkowski space  along the
3-brane, with the metric .
, , denote the coordinates of the extra dimensions.
Indices  run over all  coordinates. The original action includes an Einstein term in the bulk, and an
Einstein term plus a cosmological constant on the brane situated at
:

S = d^4x d^Ny  -g^(D)   1 2 _D 
R^(D)  + - g^(4)   ^N(y) [ 1 2 _4 
R^(4)  + _4 ]    . Our convention for the curvature scalar  is such that, in a
weak field expansion, 
, i.e. the sign of the curvature is opposite to the
sign of . Then  in () corresponds to a positive
cosmological constant for . Smoothing out the 3-brane corresponds to a replacement of 
in () by a profile function . Let us introduce
spherical coordinates in the extra dimensions: 
 where , , are angles on
 (an infinitely thin brane would be situated at ).
The profile function now depends on  only, .  is
non-vanishing only for , where  is the width of the
brane. An explicit solution of Einstein's equation everywhere, i.e. also for
, is not possible for general profile functions .
Therefore, as stated in the introduction, we make the particularly
simple choice . The blown-up brane is then
"hollow", all tension is located at the surface . It
corresponds to an infinitely thin  brane with a geometry
, where  is a sphere with radius
. The fact that this  brane is again infinitely thin does not
necessarily induce singularities in its surrounding gravitational
field, since its co-dimension is just 1 (the dimension of its world
volume is ). Correspondingly we should also replace the Einstein term
 on the brane by 
, since this will be the structure induced by radiative
corrections. The  coordinates along the brane are
 and the angles .  Thus the action () is
replaced by

S = d^4x d^Ny  -g^(D)   1 2 _D 
R^(D)  + - g^(D-1)   (r - r_b) [ 1 2
_D-1    R^(D-1)  + _D-1  ]    . Subsequently we will be interested in Poincare invariant (on
) and spherically symmetric (on ) background
metrics with ; then we have
. The Einstein equations derived from () read

1 _D  G_AB ^(D)  = 1 g_rr    (r -
r_b) [ - 1 _D-1   G_AB ^(D-1)  + g_AB ^(D-1) 
_D-1  ]  where  is the pull-back of  onto the
brane, and the Einstein tensor  is constructed from
. For  (or ) we have 
. Up to now this is the same setup as considered in
. A static metric with the desired symmetries has the form

ds^2 = A^2 (r)  _   dx^   dx^  + B^2(r) dr^2 +
C^2(r)  d_N-1 ^2  , where  is the metric on . Note that
our convention for  is such that flat space corresponds to 
. The parameters ,  in ()
are then related to the original 4-dimensional parameters ,
, as

2.5e 
1 _D-1   = 1 _N-1   C^N-1 (r_b)   1
_4   , 
  _D-1  = 1 _N-1   C^N-1 (r_b)   _4
where  is the volume of the unit sphere .
An asymptotically (for ) flat solution of the empty space
Einstein equations (for ) for ,  and  has
been given in:

2.6e 
A(r) = f_o^-1 4  N - 1 N+2   
  B(r) = f_o^1 N-2  ( N - 1 N+2  - N - 3 
2 )    C(r) = r f_o^1 N-2  (  1 2  + N - 1 
N+2  ) 
with

f_o = 1 + r^N-2   .
(The index  attached to  stands for "outside".) The
parameter  in () can also be written as 
, and will be determined in terms of the parameters in the
action () below. Next we seek for a solution of the empty space Einstein equations for 
. In the metric for  has been chosen flat
(constant), and no singularity free solution to the junction conditions
(see below) has been found. Instead, we chose for the metric for  a copy of the metric 
for  after a coordinate transformation

r' = r_b^2 r 
and renaming . The coefficient  in ()
ensures that all components of the metric are continuous across 
. Explicitely the metric for  reads

2.9e 
A(r) = f_i^-1 4  N - 1 N+2   
  B(r) = r_b^2 r^2  f_i^1 N-2  ( N - 1 
N+2  - N -
3 2 )    C(r) = r_b^2 r  f_i^1 N-2  (  1 2  + 
N - 1
N+2  ) 
with

f_i = 1 + ( r r_b^2 )^N-2 
and hence . If one introduces an exponential radial coordinate  through 
 for , one sees that eqs. () and
() are related by a -symmetry (reflection) around 
. For convenience (the junction conditions below) we stick to a
single coordinate   ranging from 0 to ; the price to pay are
the coordinate singularities for  in (): The
divergence in  indicates that the point  is at infinite
proper distance from the "surface" at  (since it is an image of
), and the behaviour of  shows that the proper volume 
of spheres at radii  blows up the same way as the one of
spheres at radii . In spite of the fact that the volumes both "inside" and "outside"
are infinite (mirrors of each other), the proper volume of the extra 
dimensional part of the brane on  at  is finite and
given by . Finally we have to show, however, that the metric () for  
, and () for , allows to satisfy the junction
conditions at , i.e. to match the coefficients of 
 in the Einstein equations (). Let us first discuss the coefficients of  on the
right-hand side of eq. (), which are non-vanishing only for
 or . To this end we need
the , -components of the Einstein
tensor  computed from the pull-back metric
 (Subsequently ,  and  denote
, , and  evaluated at ):

2.11e 
G_ ^(D-1) (r_b) = A^2 (N-1) (N-2) 2 C^2   _ 
 ,
  G_ ^(D-1)  (r_b) = 1 2  (N-2) (N-3)
g_ ^(N-1)  ,
where  is the metric on  with
unit radius. Thus the non-vanishing right-hand sides of eq.
() read

  2.12e 
(r - r_b) _  ( - A^2(N-1)(N-2) 2
_D-1  B C^2  + A^2 B  _D-1  )  ,   (r - r_b) g_ ^(N-1)  ( - (N-2)(N-3) 2
_D-1  B   + C^2 B  _D-1  )  .
Terms  appear on the left-hand side of eq.
() due to the discontinuous first derivatives of the metric 
across . Generally one finds

2.13e 
G_ ^(D)  = (r - r_b) _  A^2 B^2  ( - 3 [ A" A ] - (N-1) [ C" C ]  ) +  regular   , 
G_ ^(D)  = (r - r_b) g_ ^(N-1)  C^2 
B^2  ( - 4 [ A" A ] - (N-2) [
C" C ] ) +  regular 
where

[ A" A ] = . ( _r A 
A _r_b +   -  . _r A A  _r_b -   )_0 and similarly for . No terms  appear
in  for any , in agreement with the right-hand side of
eq. (). From ,  in eqs. () and
() one finds

2.15e 
[ A" A  ] = N-2 2r_b (1 - 1 f ) N-1 N+2    ,   [ C" C  ] = 1 r_b (1 - 2  N-1
N+2   + 1 f (1 + 2 N-1 N+2  ) )  .
where . 
Thus the terms  in eq. () imply 

2.16e 
A^2 _D B^2 r_b  (1-N+w + 1 f (1-N-w))
 = A^2 B  ( - (N-1)
(N-2) 2 _D-1 C^2  + _D-1  )  ,
 
-C^2 _D B^2 r_b  (N-2)(1+1 f  ) = C^2
B  ( - (N-2)(N-3) 2 _D-1  C^2  +
_D-1  )  , 

where we have defined .  These equations
can be considerably simplified. Using  (cf. eqs.
() and (), or () and ())
they can be brought into the form

2.17e 
f (1-w) + 1 f   (1+w) =  
(N-2)_D _D-1 C   , f (N-1+(N-3)w)+1 f  (N-1-(N-3)w)
= -2_D _D-1  C  . 
  Let us recall the basic parameters in the action () 
describing the
blown-up brane. These are i) The -dimensional gravitational constant , which
can be written in terms of a -dimensional gravitational scale 
as

1 _D  = M_D^2+N   .
ii) The radial position of the -part of the brane in the 
extra dimensions is given by ; however, only its proper volume 
 is of physical significance, which is given by

V_S^(N-1)   = _N-1   C^N-1 
where  is the volume of the unit sphere.  Eq.
() explains the physical meaning of .iii) The gravitational constant  on the brane is related
through () to the effective 4-dimensional gravitational
constant . Defining  we thus have

  1 _D-1   = 1 V_S^(N-1)   _4  = M_Pl ^2
_N-1  C^N-1    . iv) The cosmological constant  (or tension) on the brane
is related through () to the 4-dimensional cosmological
constant :

_D-1  = _4 V_S^(N-1)    = _4 _N-1  C^N-1    .
v) The width of the resulting gravitational field in the radial
direction is given by a parameter  in 
, with

f = 1 + r_b^N-2    .
Instead of ,  can be considered as a parameter to be
solved for. Then  is given in terms of  and  through eq. 
() at , and  in terms of  and 
through (). Now we have 2 equations () (originating from the 
 and  components of the junction
conditions) to solve. This implies immediately that the 4 input
parameters i) - iv) cannot be arbitrary; one "fine-tuning" relation
has to be  satisfied. Note that we count  (or ) as an input
parameter: Its origin is the profile function in the radial direction
of the "blown-up" 3-brane (localized at its surface), introduced
originally as an UV regulator. Furthermore some consistency conditions have to be satisfied:  and
notably  have to be positive. If , the metric is generically 
complex, and there exists always a naked singularity in the bulk
 which is precisely what we want to avoid. Eqs. () can be solved most easily with , 
 and  (positive) as input: Then eq. ()
determines , for which luckily always a positive solution exists.
Subsequently eq. () fixes  (or 
with  given). One sees immediately that  has to
be fine-tuned. Apart from this constraint on  (or ), the 
existence of consistent (singularity-free) solutions is quite
remarkable, given the general presence of naked singularities in the
case of flat -branes in  codimensions. Let us first consider the case without an Einstein term on the brane,
i.e. . Then eq. () fixes 
, and eq. () gives 
. Thus, with eqs. 
() and (),

M_ ^4 M_D^2+N   C^N-2   .
With  we have 
, hence

r_0^N-2  M_ ^4  M_D^-(N+2)   .
This order of magnitude of  coincides with  the one in
.Of phenomenological interest (cf. the next section) is, however, the
opposite limit

_D _D-1  C  1  . Now eq. () gives

(f )^-1  _D _D-1  C  .
( implies that the parameter , introduced below
eq. (), is negative.) Now eq. () implies, from eq.
() or () for ,

A (_D _D-1  C )^12 N-1N+2   
As we will see in the next section, at the example of the scalar 
propagator, only in this limit the graviton propagator on the brane has
the  possibility to behave 4-dimensionally over a wide range of
scales.The Scalar Propagator 

As a first step towards the momentum dependence of the brane-to-brane
graviton propagator in the present gravitational background we will
study the corresponding propagator of a (dimensionless) scalar field,
whose kinetic terms in the bulk and on the brane have identical
coefficients as the  Einstein terms in the action ().
Although an exact expression for this  propagator cannot be given, the
essential features of its momentum dependence can be  deduced using
results from. The differential equation for the general (bulk-to-bulk) scalar 
propagator has the form

( 1 _D  ^(D)  + 1 _D-1 B  (r - r_b) ^(D-1)  ) G(x-x', y, y') = - 1 -g^(D)     ^4(x-x') ^N(y-y') . We recall that ,  and  define the metric
(), and ,  and  denote these functions at .
The  extra coordinates  are split into 
 where  are  the angles on , and
subsequently  will denote the (dimensionless) angular
part of the metric on . Then the Laplacians in () are

^(D)   = A^-2 (r) _  ^  _  + 1
-g^(D)    _r -g^(D)   B^-2 (r) _r
+ C^-2  (r) _  g^  _   ,
and

^(D-1)  = A^-2  _  ^  _  +
C^-2  _  g^  _   . The determinant of the -dimensional metric is

-g^(D)   = A^4(r)  B(r) C^N-1 (r) (g_ )   .
We will Fourier transform  with respect to the 4
Minkowski coordinates , whereupon 
 is replaced by . Furthermore,
following, we will decompose the angular part of the
propagator into spherical harmonics  (
) on :

G(x-x',r,y^ , r', y'^ ) = d^4 p (2 )^4 
e^ipx  _N-1  _, m_a  Y_ ^m_a* (y^ )
Y_ ^m_a (y'^ )G_  (p,r,r')where  is the volume of the unit sphere, and the
spherical harmonics satisfy

_,m_a  Y_ ^m_a* (y^ ) 
Y_ ^m_a (y'^ ) = 1 (g_ )  
^N-1  (y^  -  y'^  )  ,
_  g^  _   
Y_ ^m_a (y^ ) =
- (+ N - 2) Y_ ^m_a  (y^ )  . Putting , the equation for the bulk-to-brane propagator
 becomes

&& 1 _D  [ A^-2 (r) p^2 - 1 -g^(D)    _r -g^(D)   B^-2  (r) _r +
C^-2  (r) (+ N - 2) ] . 

&&. + 1 _D-1  B  (r- r_b) [ A^-2  
p^2 + C^-2  (+ N - 2)]  G_  (p, r, r_b)


&&= 1 A^4B C^N-1  _N-1    (r-r_b)  .Following the solution of eq. () can be
written as

G_ (p,r,r_b) = D_ (p, r, r_b) 1 + A^4 C^N-1 
_N-1  _D-1   ( A^-2  p^2 + C^-2  (+ N-2)) D_  (p, r_b, r_b)  where  is the propagator in the 
absence of field dependent terms on the brane and satisfies

&&1 _D  [ A^-2  (r) p^2 - 1 -g^(D)   
_r -g^(D)   B^-2 (r) _r + C^-2 (r) (+ N-2)] D_  (p,r,r') 

&&= 1 A^4 B C^N-1  _N-1    (r - r')  .Defining an operator  as (using ()
for )
O _ (r) = -1 A^2(r) B(r)C^N-1 (r)  _r 
A^4(r) B^-1 (r) C^N-1 (r) _r + A^2(r) C^2(r)  (+ N-2) eq. () can be rewritten as

( O _ (r) + p^2 ) D_ (p,r,r') = k (r-r')
with

k = _D A^2 B C^N-1  _N-1    .
The wave equation corresponding to eq. () (with a vanishing
right-hand side, and in the notation ) has been studied in
. There the setup is slightly different than the one 
considered here: In the brane (for the purpose of solving
the wave equation) is located at , and the functions ,
 and  in  are of the form () for
. The remarkable result in is that inspite
of the singular behaviour of these functions for  the
solutions of the wave equation, and hence the scalar propagator, are
well defined. In the present case the brane is located at , and the
functions ,  and  in  are of the
form () only for , but of the form 
() for , hence -symmetric under 
. Asymptotically, both for  and
,  tends to the (radial) Laplacian in flat
space. Hence its spectrum is continuous, with eigenfunctions
 that behave as plane waves for  and 
. Here  denotes a continuum variable conjugate to . These
eigenfunctions can be decomposed into even ones under  (with
vanishing radial derivatives at ) and odd ones under 
(which vanish at ).It is possible to repeat the analysis in of the operator 
 in the present setup (without singularities for 
, except for coordinate singularities, but jumps in the first
radial derivatives of ,  and  at ), with the
same result:  is self-adjoint and thus
semi-positive. Hence the eigenfunctions  satisfying

O _   (,q, r) = e^2(q, )  (, q, r)
with  represent a complete basis.Although neither these functions nor their eigenvalues are not known
explicitely  (except for the zero modes) they can be used to
construct a formal solution for the bulk Green function 
 satisfying eq. ():

D_ (p, r, r') = k dq (,q, r)  (, q, r')
p^2 + e^2 (q, )  The rough behaviour of  for  can be
obtained from eq. () from the behaviour of the eigenvalues
 for : First, dimensional analysis dictates
that we must have . No powers of  can
appear here, since the problem is non-singular for 
. This shows already that 
. Below we will be interested in the brane-to-brane propagator (and in
the  partial wave), and in this case we can be somewhat more
precise on the corresponding coefficient. Expanding 
 around  it becomes simply , in
which case () can be solved by simple Fourier transformation
and the argument of the -integral in () becomes 
. Thus one finds

D_=0  (p 0, r_b , r_b) kB Ap  .
 
Note that if one would compactify the extra dimensions inside a 
finite volume of size , the spectrum of 
 would be discrete. Then the integral  in
() would be replaced by a sum over discrete modes 
with spacing , and the  behaviour of 
would be entirely due to the zero mode: 
 in contrast to the -behaviour obtained for
infinite extra dimensions. The result () can be plugged into (), together
with  given in (). Up to factors of 
 one finds

G_  (p,r_b,r_b) _DA^3 C^N-1 _N-1  
1 p + A _D _D-1   ( A^-2 
p^2 + C^-2  (+ N-2))   . Of particular importance is the denominator in the second factor in
(), and the question where and when it behaves 
such that a phenomenologically acceptable  dependence of the
propagator is obtained. First, to this end the first term has to be small with respect to the
second one, i.e.

p A _D-1   _D 
which is true at scales  with

r_c _D A_D-1    .
Now recall that the second and third terms in the denominator 
originate from the kinetic term  localized on the brane,
whose extra  dimensions ( of them) are compactified on
. Once this term dominates, the propagator sees the
corresponding Kaluza-Klein states (partial waves  with ) with
masses  in agreement with the metric  ().
Contributions of these states to the full propagator  in
() (the sum over ) would not be acceptable, since
they would again modify its -dependence and turn it into a 
 dimensional propagator. Thus one has to require

p   M_kk  A C 
in which regime only the  mode contributes. Once the inequalities () and () are satisfied, 
the  brane-to-brane propagator behaves as

G_0 (p, r_b, r_b) _D-1  C^N-1  _N-1 A^2p^2  
_4 A^2 p^2   ,
where we have used () in the last step. The  coefficient
coincides with the one obtained from a 4-dimensional action

S = 1 2_4  d^4x -g^(4)   _  
g^  _  with , as it should. The two inequalities () and () are compatible
only if

_D _D-1 C  1 .
Let us consider the required orders of magnitude in more detail. For
the scale , beyond which gravity would change, one can only
tolerate , where  is the Hubble
constant today. Hence, rewriting eq. (), 

r_c _D C_D-1   C A    
H_0^-1   .
On the other side, in order not to change gravity at distances
down to m through Kaluza-Klein states with masses 
trapped on  we need

M_kk  A C  > 10^-3  eV   .
With  eV eqs. () and ()
imply

_D C_D-1   > 10^30   .
Now recall that, from the junction conditions derived in the
previous chapter, the combination of parameters in () is
related to the warp factor  on the brane. From eqs. (),
() with () one finds

A > 10^15N-1N+2    .
A huge warp factor on the brane aggravates the hierarchy problem (i.e.
the smallness of the Weak Scale as compared to the Planck Scale) instead
of solving it in the sense of via a tiny warp factor on the
brane.If one is willing to swallow this complication, one can translate the
constraint (), via eqs. () and (), into
a constraint on the -dimensional gravitational scale  and ,
which is related to the size of the blown-up brane in the extra
dimensions via (). Then () gives 

M_Pl ^2_N-1  M_D^2 (M_D C)^N  > 10^30  .
For  one obtains

M_D < 10^-15  M_Pl 
as in the co-dimension 1 case in. However, eq.
() allows to generate a huge number more easily, if one
allows for . In the extreme case 
one obtains

( M_Pl  M_D  ) ^N+2  > 10^30 
which, for  large, allows for much more modest ratios
.What would be the required tension (cosmological constant) on the brane?
From eqs. () one finds that, in the limit () and
(), its right hand sides are of comparable magnitude. Using
eqs. () and () this gives

_4 M_Pl ^2 C^2 
or  in the case (),
 in the case ().In order to see whether this scenario is phenomenologically viable, the
complete spectrum of physical fluctuations would have to be
studied.The tensor structure of 4-dimensional gravity, in the presence of an
additional Einstein term on the brane, has recently been the subject of
numerous investigations [3, 9, 16-21]. Note that the problematic result
(ghosts and tachyons for ) obtained in cannot be
applied here, since we have a non-trivial gravitational background and,
notably, replaced  by  on the blown-up brane, hence
we have an effective codimension one scenario. The recent results in
the co-dimension 1 case, on the other hand, point towards a
phenomenologically acceptable tensor structure of 4-dimensional gravity
[16-20]. Nevertheless the details in the present case, as well as the
spectrum of 4-dimesional scalars (moduli), remain to be studied.Independently thereof we want to emphasize that the present brane
configuration can also be studied in compact  extra dimensions, in
which case the correct structure of 4-dimensional gravity is guaranteed
even without an additional Einstein term on the brane. Given the
present negative result on the solution of the cosmological constant
problem, and the required hierarchies of scales in the case of
infinite-volume extra dimensions (notably the need for 
, although our eq. () reduces the required
hierarchy), compact extra dimensions are perhaps somewhat more
promising. Work in this direction is in progress.
