We propose a new variant of the Hamiltonian reduction for constructing  -particle (super)conformal
theories in one dimension starting from a direct sum of  (super)conformal
mechanics.  As an application we explicitly build
 superconformal Calogero-type models both in superfields and in components.

1. Introduction 


Systems describing pairwise interactions on  particles in one
dimension are important for several reasons. At the classical
level they provide interesting examples of integrable models (see
Ref. for a review) and exhibit intriguing relations with
semisimple Lie algebras and Hamiltonian reductions of
 Yang-Mills theory. At the quantum level they turn out
to be completely solvable (see e.g. Refs., and references
therein).

Apart from the mathematical concern in the chain of
one-dimensional many-body systems, some of them admit
interesting physical applications. It has been known for a long
time that the -particle Calogero model characterized by the
potential , with  being a
dimensionless coupling constant, exhibits conformal invariance
. Exploiting the latter, Gibbons and Townsend argued
recently that an  superconformal extension of the
Calogero model may be relevant for a microscopic description of
the extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, at least near the
horizon. Unfortunately, beyond the two-particle caseno such model has been constructed so far. Generally, one works
within the framework of supersymmetric (quantum) mechanics, where
an attempt to incorporate superconformal generators leads one to
contradictory equations. Surprisingly enough, in 
the situation turns out to be simpler and an 
superconformal Calogero model can be constructed. However, a naive
dimensional reduction to one dimension breaks  down to .
It is worth mentioning also the approach of Ref. , where an
 supersymmetric multidimensional quantum mechanics involving
an arbitrary potential has been constructed. However, no specific
choice for the potential that would reproduce the Calogero model
has been presented.

In the present letter we suggest a simple method for constructing
variant  superconformal Calogero-type models
out of a composite system containing one free particle (describing the center
of mass) and  copies of the  superconformal
mechanics . The approach appeals to a
specific Hamiltonian reduction
where one imposes constrains on an original (simple)
model in order to generate a nontrivial potential for a resulting
reduced system. As will be discussed in detail below, the main
point is not to destroy the standard structure of a kinetic term
when implementing the reduction.

In the next section we illustrate the method and show how the
reduction works for the purely bosonic Calogero model. In Sect. 3
we turn to treat the supersymmetric case and reproduce the 
superconformal extension constructed earlier by Freedman and Mende
in. Sect. 4 is split into three subsections related
to three different  off-shell superconformal multiplets known.
In particular, we construct an  superconformal
extension for a complexification of the Calogero model, build a
many-body generalization of the  superconformal mechanics of
Ref. and discuss problems related to an 
superconformal extension of the real Calogero model. Throughout
the paper, we choose to work in superfields.






2. The Calogero model from multidimensional conformal mechanics 


Before treating in detail the entire superconformal case, it is worth illustrating how
the reduction works for bosonic systems. Our goal in this section will be to get the Calogero model
with the action functional
Cal1 
S=dt (_i=1 ^n q _i^2 2 
-_i<j g (q_i-q_j) ^2 ),
starting from a multidimensional conformal mechanics.

The idea which underlies our construction is to start from a model which is the sum of 
conformal mechanicscm0 
S_0=dt  _i<j ( 1 2  x_ij  x_ij   -g x_ij ^2  ), x_ij =-x_ji 
 , i,j =1,,n .
The latter action involves the same number of interaction terms as that in Cal1  but, for the time being, all of them
are independent. In order to bring these terms to the form familiar form the Calogero model, let us impose the
constraints(Despite of the fact that  variables 
explicitly appear in the constraints, only  variables  in cm1  prove to be linearly
independent.) 
cm1 
x_ij =1 n  ( q_i-q_j )  ,
which reduce the number of independent degrees of freedom from  down to .  After substituting cm1  into the
action cm0  we get the proper interaction terms, provided the identification
g=ng  .
However, the kinetic term is non-standard
cm2 
S_kin =dt  _i<j  1 2n  (q_i  - q_j  )^2 .
In order to bring this to a diagonal form, let us add to the  action cm0  an extra term
which describes a free motion of the center of mass
cm3 
S_1= S_0 +dt x_0 ^2 2  ,
where
cm1a 
 x_0=1 n  _i q_i .
With such an amendment the action cm3  coincides with that of the Calogero model.
Thus, we derived the -particle Calogero model starting from  copies of the conformal
mechanics (a free particle and  copies with the same coupling constant).

Being a composite system, the action cm3  exhibits
invariance which is the direct product of   groups.
The constraints cm1 ,cm1a  which specify the reduction
hold invariant with respect to the "diagonal"  transformations realized as follows
cm4 
t = a+ bt+ct^2 f(t),q_i =1 2  f  q_i .
This residual symmetry is just the conformal symmetry of the Calogero model.

Worth mentioning also is that the reduction scheme outlined above can be put in rigorous
Hamiltonian terms. For example, for the three-particle case it suffices to impose only one  constraint
. This can be added to the original action cm3  with a Lagrange multiplier .
Applying the Dirac procedure, one finds a constraint system which, along with the former one, involves also
,  and . Here  and 
stand for momenta canonically conjugate to the variables  and , respectively. The entire constraint system
proves to be second class. After introducing the Dirac bracket the variables  and, say , can
be eliminated from the consideration, brackets for the remaining variables having a non-canonical form. A passage to
the new variables , ,   (and the same for the momenta)
proves to diagonalize the bracket and leads one to the three-particle Calogero model.

Obviously, the construction is general enough and can be applied to any -particle system with a potential of the form
. In order to get the action for such a system,
one should start with  copies of one-particle models involving the
potential  and a free particle (the center of mass). After implementing the reduction cm1 , cm1a 
one generates the -particle system with the potential .
For example, the -particle Calogero model with the harmonic oscillator potential
harmcal 
S=dt (_i=1 ^n q _i^2 2  -_i<j  ^2 (q_i-q_j) ^2
-_i<j g (q_i-q_j) ^2 ),
can be obtained from a composite system which contains a free particle and  copies of the
conformal mechanics
modified by the inclusion of the harmonic oscillator potential
S=dt (x _0 ^2 2  +  _i=1 ^n(n-1)/2 ( x_i ^2 2   -g/n x_i^2  -n^2 x_i^2) ).
One should stress that all symmetries of the one-particle system which are realized homogeneously  and linearly  on the
coordinate , will hold in the resulting -particle system because they preserve the reduction constraints.


The fact that one can treat the -particle Calogero model as a specific Hamiltonian reduction of a simpler
composite system is not just a matter of aesthetics. It is well known that the conformal mechanics
can be endowed with   and
 supersymmetries .
The trick described above suggests a quite new and intriguing possibility to
construct a superconformal generalization of the -particle Calogero model. It suffices to
start with a composite system involving a superconformal extension of a free particle and 
copies of the superconformal mechanics  and apply an appropriate Hamiltonian reduction.
In the next section we treat in detail the  case.  models are discussed in Sect. 4.



3. The  superconformal  Calogero model 



We next wonder how to incorporate  supersymmetry in the reduction scheme outlined above.
As we already mentioned, in order to preserve symmetries characterizing one-particle
constituents of a composite system, one should apply the reduction
to coordinates which transform homogeneously and linearly. For the supersymmetric case this means
that one is forced to work with superfields because in many cases after elimination of
auxiliary fields supersymmetry transformations become nonlinear.
Thus, the starting point is the  superconformal mechanics, whose superfield action
reads
n2scm 
S_0=1 2 dt dd( D X X -2 g  X  ) .
Here  is a general bosonic  real superfield and the covariant derivatives are defined as
D=  +i t ,
  +i t ,
 D,=2i t  .
The action n2scm  is invariant with respect to the following transformations
n2tr 
t=E-1 2 E-1 2 D E,i 2 E,
= -i 2  D E,X= 1 2 E X,
where the superfunction  collects all the infinitesimal parameters of the 
superconformal group
E(t,,) = f(t)-2i(+t) -2i(+ t)+h .
Here  is the same as in cm4 ,  is a  rotation parameter, and
 and  correspond to Poincare and conformal supersymmetries, respectively.

In order to construct an  superconformal -particle Calogero model, let us consider a composite
system which involves an  superconformal extension of a free particle action
and  copies of the  superconformal mechanics
n2cal1 
S=1 2 dt dd[ D X_0X_0 +_i<j  ( D X_ij  X_ij  -2 g X_ij  )] ,
where
X_ij =-X_ji  ,i,j =1,2,, n.
Much alike the bosonic case, we impose the reduction constraints which express  original
superfields  in terms of  independent new ones 
n2hamred 
X_0=1 n  _i V_i X_ij =1 n   ( V_i-V_j ) .
Upon substitution of n2hamred  into n2cal1  one gets the action of an  superconformal -particle
Calogero model
n2cal2 
S=1 2 dt dd( _i=1 ^n D V_i  V_i  -2 g _i<j  V_i-V_j ) .
Eliminating  auxiliary fields  with the use of their equations of motion
one can rewrite the action functional n2cal2  in terms of the physical degrees of freedom

n2cal3 
S=1 2 dt [ _i=1 ^n (q_i   ^2 -i_i_i  +
 i_i _i) - _i<j  g^2-g(_i-_j)(_i-_j) (q_i-q_j)^2  ] ,
where
q_i=V_i __i=iD V_i _  _i=iV_i _Being reformulated in Hamiltonian terms, the latter theory proves to coincide with that obtained by
Freedman and Mende in the framework of many-body supersymmetric quantum mechanics.

Two comments are in order. Firstly, since each of the superfields  transform linearly and homogeneously
with respect to the proper  transformations, the constraints n2hamred 
hold invariant under the residual  group acting in a uniform way on all the superfields
n2tr1 
V_i =1 2 E  V_i .
Thus, the actions n2cal2 , n2cal3  possess  superconformal symmetry by construction. Secondly,
one can employ the supersymmetric reduction, in order to build supersymmetric many-body systems with a potential of
a more general form . It suffices to start with a proper number of one-particle
systems and perform the Hamiltonian reduction n2hamred  in that framework. All symmetries which
are realized linearly and homogeneously will survive the reduction.



4. Calogero models with  superconformal symmetry 


The situation becomes more complicated when one tries to extend the analysis, in order to incorporate
 superconformal symmetry. First of all, let us remind that the  superconformal group in  is the exceptional
supergroup . Only for specific values of the parameter, namely  with the notation
from Ref., this algebra
is isomorphic to . Generally, only the  factor is taken into account,
while the  subalgebra is kept explicitly broken. Secondly, three different
 off-shell supermultiplets are known, which can be used for constructing an  superconformal Calogero model.
The first multiplet contains one real scalar, four real fermions and three real auxiliary fields.
We shall call this the 4a  multiplet. The second multiplet involves
one complex scalar, four real fermions and one complex auxiliary scalar. We will call this the 4b  multiplet.
Finally, it was recognized recently that
a multiplet with three real scalars, four real fermions and one real auxiliary field underlies
a new version of  superconformal mechanics (for the case of a vanishing coupling constant, see also Ref. ).
 We will call the latter multiplet the  multiplet.
Thus, taking different multiplets one may expect to be able to construct at least three different versions of the
 superconformal Calogero model. Finally, it is important to stress that in all the cases
basic  superfields are subject to constraints. Therefore, one should check that the Hamiltonian reduction is
compatible with such conditions. Keeping all this in mind, we proceed to construct
 superconformal extensions of the -particle Calogero model.



4.1 The 4b  multiplet 



We start with the 4b  multiplet, this being the simplest multiplet to handle.
The superfield action of the  superconformal mechanics for this multiplet reads4baction 
S=1 2  ( dt d^4YY  -gdt d^2Y -g dt d^2 Y ) ,
where the  superfields  are constrained to obey the chirality conditions
^a Y= D_a Y =0.
The covariant derivatives entering the equations above read
D_a= ^a +i_a t ,
^a= _a -i^a  t ,a=1,2 .
The action 4baction  is invariant with respect to the  transformations
4btr 
t=E-1 2 ^2 D_a E+1 2 _a^a E,
^a=i 2 ^a E, _a=-i 2 D_a E,Y =E_L (t_L,)Y,
where we made use of the notation , .
The superfunction  collects all the parameters of the  group
&& E=f-2i( (t)-(t)) +1 2 ( ^k ) b^k -2
 ( + )+1 2 ()^2 f  ,
 

&& f=a+bt+ct^2,  ^a (t) =^a+^a t,
while the chiral superfunction  is defined as follows
E_L=1 2 f(t_L)+2i^a _a(t_L).
Owing to the homogeneous character of the transformation law 4btr  for  and , one can apply the Hamiltonian reduction.
As before, the starting point is the sum of a kinetic term for the superfield   and  extra terms
of the form 4baction  with .
The reduction constraints read
n4hamred 
Y_0=1 n  _i V_i Y_ij =1 n   ( V_i-V_j ) ,
where   denote  new independent superfields which obey
the same chirality conditions ^a V_i= D_a V_i =0.
The resulting action functional has the form 4bCal 
S_4b =1 2  ( dt d^4_i V_iV_i 
-gdt d^2_i < j V_i-V_j -
g dt d^2 _ i < j   V_i  -V_j  ) .
Notice that by construction the action holds invariant with respect to the residual "diagonal"  transformations,
which are realized in the same way as in Eq. 4btr  above, for all the superfields .
In order to clarify the status of this model, we eliminate auxiliary fields and go over to the
physical components

q_i=V_i _q_i  =V_i __ia =-i D_a V_i _,
  _i^a=i^a V_i _the component action having the form
4bCalcomp 
 S_4b =&&1 2 dt[ _i ( q_i q_i   +1 2 _i _i )-
 _i<j (  g^2 (q_i-q_j)(q_i -q_j)  -g (_i-_j)(_i-_j) 4(q_i-q_j)^2  -.. 

 && . . g(_i-_j)(_i-_j) 4(q_i -q_j)^2 
 ) ] .
Thus, the model 4bCalcomp  describes an  superconformal extension of a complexification of the
-particle Calogero model.



4.2 The 4c  multiplet 



This model is based on a recently proposed version of
an  superconformal mechanics. In the bosonic sector this
system contains a dilaton field together with two variables
parameterizing the two-sphere . It was
suggested in that this variant of superconformal
mechanics may be a disguised form of a charged superparticle
moving in  background. Inspired by the
application found for the -particle Calogero model in the
context of black hole physics, we extend the system to
the -particle case.

The starting point is the superfield action functional
4cactionA 
S=-dt d^2[ 1 4 (
v^2+4)^1-2 2  ( D v v + D ) +
 g  v+v^2+4  2  ]
 ,
which depends on the parameter  characterizing the
supergroup  and holds invariant with respect to the
latter.

In the last line  is a general bosonic  superfield, while the
 superfields  and  obey the chirality
conditions D =0. Altogether  ,  and  form
an irreducible  supermultiplet. The
fact that the superfields  transform
homogeneously under the  supergroup allows one to immediately
apply the reduction. Omitting the details we expose
the resulting action functional
4cCalg 
S&=&-dt
d^2[ 1 4 ( Y_0^2+4 X_0X_0)^1-2 2  ( D Y_0 Y_0 + D X_0
X_0 ) +
     .  

&& . 1 4 _i<j  ( Y_ij ^2+4 X_ij X_ij )^1-2 2  
( D Y_ij  Y_ij  + D X_ij  X_ij  )+
 g  Y_ij +Y_ij ^2+4X_ij X_ij   2  ] , where Y_0=1 n  _i=1 ^n
v_i,X_0=1 n  _i=1 ^n _i,
Y_ij =1 n   (
v_i-v_j),X_ij =1 n  (
_i-_j), and the superfields
 are chiral (anti-chiral).

As formulated in Eq. 4cCalg  above, the action functional exists
for a generic value of the parameter   (A singular
value of the parameter  is equivalent to ,
see e.g. Ref..) . However, only for  the kinetic
term has the standard flat form (for other values of 
there appears a nontrivial metric). Thus, in what
follows we concentrate on this particular case, the action
functional being drastically simplified
4caction 
S=&& -dtd^2[1 4  _i ( D v_i v_i + D _i _i ) + .


&& g_i<j  . 
v_i-v_j+(v_i-v_j)^2+4 (_i-_j)(_i
-_j)  2  ] . Notice that for a
vanishing , the action 4caction  reduces to that of the 
Calogero model n2cal2 , while for  the interaction term
disappears and one ends up with a collection of  free
particles. For completeness of the presentation we write down
the  component action (with all auxiliary fields eliminated by means of their equations of motion)
S& =& dt _i( 1 2  v_i ^2 +2 _i _i  ) -
 _i<j  (    8g^2 v_ij ^2+4_ij _ij   +
 8ig ( _ij  _ij  -_ij _ij  )  
  v_ij ^2+4_ij _ij    ( v_ij + v_ij ^2+4_ij _ij   )  .+ 

&& . 4g (v_ij ^2+4_ij _ij  )^3/2  ( v_ij _ij _ij   -v_ij _ij _ij  +
   2_ij _ij _ij  +2_ij _ij _ij    ) ),
 where
_ij  = _i-_j, v_ij =v_i-v_j ,_ij  =_i-_j,_ij =_i-_j
and the physical components  are defined as follows
v_,_i=_i__i=Dv_i__i=D_i_Thus, the model constructed in this subsection can be viewed as an 
superconformal Calogero model in three dimensions.




4.3 Troubles with the 4a  multiplet 



Being the most interesting multiplet in the context of the conjecture of
Ref., this case turns out to be the most difficult to
handle. In the framework of the Hamiltonian formalism, the problem
has been revealed already in Ref. (see also the related
work). In order to clarify how the problem looks
in our setting, let us recall that the action of the 
superconformal mechanics for the case at hand reads 4a 
S=1 16 dt d^4 ( e^u
-1 8  ^a__a  m^  u
).
Here  is a constant  vector,
which plays the role of a coupling constant, whereas the  superfield 
is constrained to obey the equation
2acon 
D_a( D^_b) u=0 .
Because the superfield 
transforms homogeneously with respect to the  superconformal
group , one still can apply the reduction procedure. As
an outcome of this one finds the action functional
4aCal 
S=1 16 dt d^4 [ e^Y_0 
+_i<j ( e^Y_ij   -1 8  ^a__a  m^  Y_ij ) ],
 where, as before,
  Y_0=1 n  _i=1 ^n v_i,
Y_ij =1 n   ( v_i-v_j),
and all the superfields  satisfy the constraints 2acon . A simple
inspection then shows that the kinetic term of the component action
includes a non-trivial coupling to a specific  metric and
thus the model fails to reproduce the Calogero model in the
bosonic limit. A way out could be to perform the reduction not in
terms of the superfield , but rather . In
other words, one can pass to the new variable
 in the action 4a  and then perform the
same reduction as before for the newly introduced superfields.
Unfortunately, this step proves to be incompatible with the
constraints 2acon  which are of the second order in the covariant
derivatives. Thus, for the 4a  multiplet the reduction method
fails to produce an  superconformal extension of a real
Calogero model.




5. Concluding remarks  



To summarize, in this paper we implemented a new variant of Hamiltonian reduction
for constructing one-dimensional many-body theories with extended superconformal symmetry starting
from a direct sum of one-particle systems. It should be stressed that all symmetries which were
realized homogeneously and linearly for the one-particle models hold in the resulting
many-body theories. The point crucial for the whole scheme was to preserve the standard structure of a
kinetic term when putting an original composite system on a constraint surface. This was
achieved  by adding to the action a free particle describing the center of mass motion.

As was mentioned above, the range of possible applications of the specific reduction
exploited in this work is actually larger than just the (super) conformal systems.
Whenever the reduction preserves the standard structure of a kinetic term, a many-body
system with the general potential  can be constructed.
Using this variant of the Hamiltonian reduction  we built two different versions of an  superconformal
extension of the -particle Calogero model. Both extensions contain only bilinear combinations
of fermions which enter the Hamiltonian . Moreover, these variants can be viewed as the two-, and
three-dimensional extensions of the Calogero model.
The additional bosonic degrees of freedom describe angular variables and their appearance seems to be
unavoidable.
As a byproduct, we also constructed a new -particle system which is invariant with
respect to the  group. It seems interesting to understand whether this system is
integrable.

Another interesting question is whether the reduction proposed in this work allows one to generate
solutions for a reduced -particle model proceeding from those characterizing an initial
simple composite system. We hope also that this kind of the Hamiltonian reduction will be useful for two-dimensional
field theories, perhaps with some modifications.
