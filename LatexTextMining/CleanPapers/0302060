ABSTRACT 
We carefully analyze the supersymmetry algebra of closed strings
and open strings in a plane wave. We use eight component chiral
spinors,  Majorana-Weyl spinors, in light-cone gauge to
provide a useful basis of string field theory calculation in the
plane wave. We consider the two classes of half BPS D-branes,
-branes, preserving 16 supersymmetries. We
exhaustively provide the supersymmetry algebra of the half BPS
branes. We also point out that the supersymmetry
algebra distinguishes the two  directions with opposite sign
which is consistent with the  symmetry of the string action.

Introduction 



The Penrose limit of the  background in type
IIB supergravity corresponds to a plane wave solution blau ,
pp-metric 
&& ds^2 = -2 dx^+ dx^- - ^2 x_I^2 (dx^+)^2 + dx_I ^2, 

&& F_+1234 =F_+5678 =2 . This implies a correspondence between type IIB string theory in
the plane wave background pp-metric  and 
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with large R-charge, in a sense
as a part of  correspondence. Since the background
pp-metric  is one of the very few Ramond-Ramond backgrounds on
which string theory is exactly solvable metsaev1,metsaev2 ,
one may have a genuine
hope to explicitly check the conjectured AdS/CFT correspondence
beyond the supergravity approximation on the string theory side.
Indeed Berenstein, Maldacena and Nastase bmn  succeeded in
reproducing the string spectrum from perturbative super Yang-Mills
theory, thereby putting the duality on a firm ground at the free
theory level. Subsequent developments using the super Yang-Mills
theory kris -gursoy  and the light-cone string
field theory spradlin1 -kiem2  showed
that the duality is still valid even after the
interactions both on the super Yang-Mills theory side and on the
string theory side are introduced.




D-branes can be described by boundary states of closed string
state. The symmetries that the boundary state preserves are thus
the combinations of the closed string symmetries that leaves the
boundary state invariant. Recently possible D-branes in the plane
wave background pp-metric  were identified
and their supersymmetries were classified billo -gaberdiel .
In particular, Skenderis and Taylor showed in skenderis1,skenderis2 
that, although the kinematical supersymmetry descending from
the closed string is totally broken on a -brane hikida,gaberdiel 
(see section 2 for the definition of -branes),
a different kind of kinematical supersymmetry is nontrivially
realized by incorporating the worldsheet symmetries. We will study
this kinematical supersymmetry too.





Since the plane wave background pp-metric  allows a light-cone
gauge choice and the string theory in this background takes the
simplest form in the light-cone gauge, the most straightforward
method for constructing the superstring interactions is to use the
light-cone Green-Schwarz formalism metsaev1 .
Since the original papers green1,green2,green3 
on string field theory were using the 8-component spinors, 
Majorana-Weyl spinors, it may be desirable to provide the
supersymmetry algebra in this basis as a useful reference for
string field theory calculation in the plane wave, although
detailed analysis had been done in metsaev1,metsaev2  for the closed
string and in skenderis1,skenderis2  for the open string
using 16-component spinors,  Majorana-Weyl
spinors. Thus we will exhaustively provide the supersymmetry
algebras for both closed strings and open strings in the plane
wave background using the 8-component spinors.





As is well known the spectrum of light-cone hamiltonian of plane
wave superstring is discrete. As analyzed in metsaev3 
recently, the super Yang-Mills theory in a four-dimensional plane
wave background has also a discrete spectrum of light-cone energy
operator, so expected to be most appropriate for establishing a
precise correspondence with plane wave superstring and for the
study holographic issues of the duality. Since the plane wave
super Yang-Mills theory is the low energy worldvolume action of
probe D3-branes in the plane wave background pp-metric 
and is the ground-state sector of the open string field theory
which also has a discrete energy spectrum, it is plausible that
the plane wave super Yang-Mills theory including interactions can
be captured by the open superstring field theory defined on the
probe D3-branes kim . Furthermore the open-closed
string duality bergman,gaberdiel ,
being, probably, an underlying principle of
AdS/CFT duality, implies that the open string field theory
possibly reproduces the corresponding results of closed string
field theory. For this purpose it will be useful to explicitly
construct the supersymmetry algebra for the open
string in the plane wave background pp-metric 
using 8-component spinors mostly used in the light-cone string
field theory green1,green3 .





This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we discuss the
canonical quantization of superstrings in the plane wave
background and present the mode expansions of open strings
compatible with boundary conditions. In Sec. 3, we first analyze
the supersymmetry algebra of closed string to provide its explicit
expressions in terms of 8-component spinors. We find that the
supersymmetry algebra distinguishes the two  directions
with opposite sign consistent with the  symmetry of the
string action chu1 . Here we exhaustively provide
the mode expansions of symmetry generators and supersymmetry
algebras for half BPS D-branes, including D-branes with
worldvolume flux which were not studied in skenderis1,skenderis2 ,
using 8-component spinors. In Sec. 4, we briefly review our
results and address some other issues. In Appendix A, we explain
our notations and definitions and give useful formula used in this
paper. In Appendix B, we provide some technical details on
(anti-)commutation relations for -branes. In Appendix C, we
present how the kinematical supersymmetry of -brane can be
derived from the open string mode expansion.




Canonical Quantization of Superstrings in Plane Wave 


The Green-Schwarz light-cone action in the plane wave background pp-metric 
describes eight free massive bosons and fermions. In the
light-cone gauge, , the action is given by
gs-action 
S = 1 2^p^+  d_0 ^2^p^+ 
d[ _+X_I _-X_I - ^2 X_I^2
- i S (^A _A - )S ]
where .
Our notations and conventions are summarized in Appendix A.
In this paper we will take  for
closed string and  for open string. We take
the spinor  as eight two-component Majorana spinors on the worldsheet 
that transform as positive chirality spinors 
under (The spinors
 are two  Majorana-Weyl spinors satisfying the
light-cone gauge. These spinors can be obtained by the original
 Majorana-Weyl spinors  satisfying

fixing the -symmetry. As in so8-spinor ,
the fermionic light-cone gauge can be solved by taking

S^a= (

where
2d-dirac

), ^=(
 
).
The presence of  in the fermionic action breaks the symmetry
from  to .
The equations of motion following from the action gs-action 
take the form
eom-boson 
&& _+_-X^I + ^2 X^I =0, 

eom-fermion 
&& _+ S^1 - S^2 =0, _-S^2 + S^1 =0.

Closed string 


First we analyze the closed string case. Detailed analysis
using 16-component spinors had been done in metsaev1,metsaev2 
for the closed string and in skenderis1,skenderis2  for open strings.
We will instead use 8-component spinors
as in the original papers green1,green2,green3 
on string field theory. This will be a useful basis for light-cone
string field theory and for open string analysis.




The general solutions to Eqs. eom-boson  and eom-fermion 
for the closed string are found to be(In our following analysis
the mode expansion of string fields will be performed for real
fields. Thus the reality of the field requires that 
for any bosonic or fermionic n-th mode .) 
sol-boson 
&& X^I(, )=x_0^I + p_0^I   +i_n

sol-fermion 
&& S^1 (,)= S_0^1

+i _n _n^2(,)S_n^2), && S^2 (,)= S_0^2

+ _n 0 c_n(_n^2(,) S_n^2
- i _n _n^1(,)S_n^1),
where the basis functions  are
defined by

_n^1(,)=e^-i(_n -
n  ) , _n^2(,)=e^-i(_n + n  ) 
and
omega-etc 
_n = sgn (n) ^2 + n^2/^2 , _n=
_n-n/  , c_n= 1 1+_n^2  .
For canonical quantization let us introduce the canonical momenta
momenta 
P^I(,)= 1 2 X ^I(,),
P^Aa (,)= i 2 S^Aa (,),
where .
After removing the second class constraint in the fermionic part
by introducing the Dirac bracket, we get the following equal-time
quantum (anti-)commutation relations
commutator-field-boson 
&&[X^I(,), X ^J(^,)]=
i2 ^IJ  (commutator-field-fermion 
&& S^Aa (,), S^Bb (^,) =
 ^ab  ^AB  (The above quantization gives the (anti-)commutation relations for
the modes in sol-boson  and sol-fermion :
commutator-mode-boson 
&& [x_0^I, p_0^J]=i^IJ , [_n^IA ,_m^JB ]= _n
_m+n,0  ^IJ ^AB , 

commutator-mode-fermion 
&& S_n^Aa , S_m^Bb   = 1 2  _n+m,0 
^ab ^AB .

Open string 


Now we will discuss open strings living on a D-brane in plane
wave background pp-metric . Here we consider only static
D-branes for simplicity. To describe a Dp-brane, we impose the
Neumann boundary conditions on  coordinates and Dirichlet
boundary conditions on the remaining transverse coordinates:
bc-boson 
&& _X^r_ =0, 

&& _X^r^ _ =0.
For the fermionic coordinates, the appropriate boundary condition
lambert 
is
bc-fermion 
S^1_ =S^2_ .
It turns out skenderis1,skenderis2,gaberdiel 
that in the plane wave background there are two
classes of maximally supersymmetric Dp-branes, depending on the
choice of :
two-class 
D_-: = -1, D_+: =1.
The boundary conditions, , in two-class  together with the
fermionic equations of motion, eom-fermion , imply that
bc-sigma1 
&& D_-: _S^1_  = - _S^2_ , 

bc-sigma2 
&& D_+: _S^1_  = (-_S^2 + 2 S^2)_ .
The boundary condition for  is determined by the Virasoro
constraint
virasoro 
_X^- = _X^I _X^I -i 2 (S^1_+S^1-
S^2_-S^2),
from which one can see that the  coordinate must satisfy the
Neumann boundary condition for both classes in two-class .






Here we list the allowed choices for  consistent with each
constraint in Eq. two-class . For -branes, there are the following
possibilities (for the notation used below, see Appendix A):
d-brane 
&& D3: (m,n) =(2,0), (0,2), && D5: (m,n) =(3,1), (1,3), 

&& D7: (m,n) =(4,2), (2,4). For -branes, there are the following possibilities:
d+brane 
&& D1: (m,n) =(0,0), && D3: (m,n) =(1,1), && D5: (m,n) =(4,0), (2,2),(0,4), 

&& D7: (m,n) =(3,3), && D9: (m,n) =(4,4). The quantization of open strings on  and  branes is
defined by the following equal-time quantum (anti-)commutation
relations
commutator-open1 
&&[X^I(,), X ^J(^,)]=
i ^IJ  (commutator-open2 
&& S^Aa (,), S^Bb (^,) =
 ^ab  ^AB  (For an open string, we have the several boundary
conditions on the fields, Eqs. bc-boson -two-class .
These boundary conditions will be incorporated in the mode
expansion of the fields.




-brane 





We first discuss the quantization of open strings on -brane.
The mode expansion of the bosonic coordinates satisfying the
boundary condition and the equation of motion is given by
open-boson 
&& X^r(, )=x_0^r + p_0^r   +i_n
0 1 _n _n^r  e^-i_n  
n  , && X^r^ (, )= x_0^r^ () +
_n 0 1 _n _n^r^  e^-i_n  
n  ,
where the zero mode part, , represents
a D-brane position located either at the origin or away from the
origin and is given by
x0 
x_0^r^ ()=x_0^r^  1+e^  
(e^  + e^(Similarly the mode expansion of the fermion is found to be
open-fermion 
&& S^1 (,)= S_0
- S_0
+ _n 0 c_n(_n^1(,) S_n
+i _n _n^2(,)S_n), && S^2 (,)= ^T S_0
- S_0
+ _n 0 c_n(_n^2(,) S_n
- i _n _n^1(,)S_n).
One can check that the mode expansion open-fermion  satisfies
the boundary condition bc-fermion  and bc-sigma1  as well
as the equation of motion eom-fermion .





The commutation relations for the modes in Eqs. open-boson 
and open-fermion  are determined by the field quantization in
commutator-open1  and commutator-open2  respectively
comm-open 
&& [x_0^r, p_0^s]=i^rs , [_n^I ,_m^J ]= _n
_m+n,0  ^IJ , 

&& S_n^a , S_m^b   = 1 4  _n+m,0 
^ab , (n, m Z ).

-brane 


The mode expansion of the bosons is exactly the same as the
-branes, Eq. open-boson , and for the fermions we find
that
open-fermion2 
&& S^1 (,)= S_0
+ S_0
+ _n 0 c_n(_n^1(,) S _n
+i _n _n^2(,)S_n), && S^2 (,)= ^T S_0
+ S_0
+ _n 0 c_n(_n^2(,) S_n
- i _n _n^1(,)S _n),
where
sn 
S _n = 1 _n (n   - i ) S_n.
One can check that the mode expansion open-fermion2  satisfies
the boundary conditions, Eqs. bc-fermion  and bc-sigma2 ,
as well as the equation of motion, Eq. eom-fermion .
For the -branes, the zero modes of the fermions depend on the
worldsheet space coordinate , and so there is no direct relation
with the zero modes of the closed string.




The anti-commutation relation of the modes for -branes is not
trivial and some technical details are given in Appendix B:
d+10 
&& S_0^a , S_0^b   =  4 
(^ab -()^ab 
),

d+1n0 
&& S_n^a , S_m^b   = 1 4  _n+m,0 
^ab , (n,m 0).
Note that the result d+10  has the correct flat space limit,
, including coefficient.
Using the relation sn  for the nonzero mode , the following
anti-commutation relations can be derived from Eq. d+1n0 :
d+t1 
&& S _n^a , S _m^b   = 1 4  _n+m,0 
^ab , (n,m 0), 

d+t2 
&& S _n^a , S_m^b  =
 1 4_n (n   _ab 
-i _ab  )_n+m,0 .
For the D5-branes of type  or  to be supersymmetric,
a nontrivial flux of gauge field is necessarily turned on in the
worldvolume. The inclusion of the gauge field corresponds to the
addition of the following boundary term
bi-boundary 
S_B = 1 2^p^+  d_0 ^2^p^+ 
dF^-r  _X^r =
 4 ^p^+  _   dX^r X^r,
where the Born-Infeld flux  is given by
bi 
F^-r = X^r.
This affects the Neumann boundary condition and the appropriate
boundary condition turns out to be gaberdiel 
bc-d+ 
_X^r_  = X^r_ .
The boundary coupling in Eq. bi-boundary  is indeed
generated by the superpotential in the 
worldsheet supersymmetric theory hikida .
The mode expansion of the Neumann coordinates 
 is then given by
mode-d+ 
X^r(, ) &=& 2  e^2  -1   (x_0^r + p_0^r ) e^ + i _n 0 
n _n (n-i ) 
_n^r e^-i _n   n    && + i _n 0   _n (n-i )  _n^r e^-i _n   n   .
The commutation relation between the modes is given by Eq.
comm-open  as usual. See Appendix B for the derivation.



Supersymmetry Algebra in Plane Wave 




We now study the basic symmetry algebra of the light-cone
superstring in the plane wave described by the action gs-action .
The bosonic symmetries are generated by the ten translation
generators, , the boost generators,
, the  rotation generators, ,
and the  rotation generators, .
There are also 32 supersymmetries. In the light-cone gauge the 32
components of the supersymmetries decompose into 'dynamical' and
'kinematical' components. The dynamical supercharges, ,
commutes with the light-cone hamiltonian, but the kinematical
supercharges, , for closed strings and -branes do
not due to a fermionic mass term. However we will show that all
supersymmetries commute with the hamiltonian for -branes
since the fermionic mass term identically vanishes.





Using the Nother method, the symmetry generating charges can be
obtained from conserved currents. For the superstring in the plane
wave described by the action gs-action , the super-Nother
charges were obtained by Metsaev metsaev1 :
charge-p 
&& P^+= p^+, P^I= 1 2^p^+ 
_0 ^2^p^+  d(
X ^I + X^I ), 

charge-h 
&& 2p^+ H= 1 2^p^+ 
_0 ^2^p^+  d[
(X _I^2 + X^_I ^2 + ^2 X_I^2) + i S^A S ^A
], 

charge-j+ 
&& J^+I = 1 2^ 
_0 ^2^p^+  d(
X ^I   - X^I ), 

charge-j1 
&& J^ij = 1 2^p^+ 
_0 ^2^p^+  d[(
X^i X ^j-X^j X ^i)-i 2  S^A ^ij  S^A ], 

charge-j2 
&& J^i^j^ = 1 2^p^+ 
_0 ^2^p^+  d[(
X^i^  X ^j^ -X^j^  X ^i^ )
- i 2  S^A ^i^j^  S^A ], 

charge-q+1 
&& Q^+ = 2p^+  2^p^+ 
_0 ^2^p^+  de^i (S^1 +i S^2), 

charge-q+2 
&& Q ^+ = 2p^+  2^p^+ 
_0 ^2^p^+  de^-i (S^1 - i S^2), 

charge-q-1 
&& 2p^+ Q^-1 = 1 2^p^+ 
_0 ^2^p^+  d( _- X^I^I S^1
-X_I^I S^2 ), 

charge-q-2 
&& 2p^+ Q^-2 = 1 2^p^+ 
_0 ^2^p^+  d( _+ X^I^I
S^2 + X_I^I S^1 ),
where .





The superstring action gs-action  in light-cone gauge is
quadratic in the fields. This peculiar property implies that it is
invariant up to boundary terms under a shift of the field by a
parameter that satisfies the free field equation. For
definiteness, let us consider an arbitrary shift of the fields
shift 
X^I(, ) = ^I (, ), S^A(, ) = ^A (, ).
Under the transformation, the action gs-action  changes as
follows
variation 
S &=& - 1 2^p^+  d_0 ^2^p^+ 
d (X^I (_+_- ^I + ^2 ^I)
+ 2i S (^A _A - ) ) && - 1 2^p^+  _  d( X^I _^I + i S^1(^1 - ^2)
).
For open strings, we can get a new
symmetry corresponding to the shift of the fields, Eq. shift ,
if the parameters  and  satisfy the free field equations
b-shift-eom 
&& _+_- ^I + ^2 ^I = 0, 

f-shift-eom 
&& (^A _A - ) =0,
as well as the following boundary conditions (
For D5-brane case with the boundary term bi-boundary , the
boundary variation for Nuemann coordinates is shifted as
 and
the boundary condition is instead 
.) 
bc-eta 
&& _^r_ =0, 

&& _^r^ _ =0, 

bc-epsilon 
&& ^1_ =^2_ .
Note that both the equations of motion and the above boundary
conditions are identical to those satisfied by the original
fields. For closed strings, the transformation shift  is
just a trivial field redefinition.





This mechanism can be used to restore some apparently broken
symmetries. In all such cases the violation of the closed string
symmetry depends only on quantities that are determined by the
boundary conditions. In these cases one can combine a closed
string transformation with a transformation of the form shift 
to obtain a good symmetry of the open string. In this way one can
find modified transformation rules by the use of worldsheet
symmetries that lead
to a conserved charge skenderis1,skenderis2 .
For example, -branes located at a constant transverse
position  appear to break all dynamical supersymmetries,
and the violating terms vanish when the transverse position is set
to zero, . Taking into account the extra
worldsheet symmetry,  the on-shell conserved current is actually
the same as the current for the brane at origin, but
with  replaced by
 where
 is given by Eq. x0 . Thus the
corresponding charge expressed in terms of oscillators is exactly
the same as that for the brane at the origin. This immediately
implies that the supersymmetry algebras are also the same.





Let us decompose a generic field  into a zero mode part
 and a non-zero mode part .
As one can see from the explicit mode expansions in Sec. 2, the
zero mode part  separately satisfies the
field equations, Eqs. eom-boson -eom-fermion ,
and the boundary conditions, Eqs. bc-boson -bc-fermion .
Similar consideration applied to Eq. variation  leads to
action-dec 
S[(,)] = S[ (,)].
Since we are interested only in the on-shell values of
super-Nother charges, Eq. action-dec  implies that a
Nother charge  can also be decomposed into a zero mode part
 and a non-zero mode part , that is 
. In particular the super Nother charges
 can be obtained by applying
the same Nother method to ,
which just gives the same expressions with replacement,
.
After we isolate zero mode parts in this way which possibly
contain non-periodic functions, we can apply a periodic doubling
of open strings polchinski  for the remaining non-zero mode parts
since they contain only periodic functions. The doubling trick
will be useful in the actual calculation.







In the light-cone formalism, the generators of the basic
superalgebra can be split into the kinematical generators
kinematic 
P^+, P^I,J^+I ,J^ij ,J^i^j^ ,
Q^+ _a, Q ^+ _a,
and the dynamical generators
dynamical 
H, Q^-1 _ , Q^-2 _ .
Note that the kinematical supersymmetry generators have 
positive chirality while the dynamical supersymmetry generators
have  negative chirality.
The kinematical generators 
depend only on the zero modes since they are effectively linear in
fields. Now we will study the supersymmetry algebra of the
symmetry generating charges, charge-p -charge-q-2 , for the closed
and the open strings, using the mode expansions given in the
previous section.






Closed string 



Using the mode expansions in Eqs. sol-boson  and
sol-fermion , we get
gen-closed-zero 
&& P^+ =p^+, P^I =p_0^I,J^+I = -x_0^Ip^+, 

&& Q^+=2p^+ (S_0^1+iS_0^2)= 2p^+ S_0^+,
Q ^+=2p^+ (S_0^1-iS_0^2)= 2p^+ S_0^-.
The rotation generators 
 are given by
gen-closed-j 
J^IJ  = x_0^I p_0^J - x_0^J p_0^I - i 2  S_0^A ^IJ 
S_0^A - i _n 0   1 _n 
(_-n ^AI  _n^AJ  - _-n ^AJ  _n^AI )
+ S_-n ^A ^IJ  S_n^A .
For the dynamical generators, we have
&& 2p^+ H = (p_0I ^2 + ^2 x_0I ^2) +2i S_0^1 S_0^2 +
_n 0   _-n ^AI  _n ^AI  + _n
S_-n ^A S_n^A , 

&& 2p^+ Q^-1  = p_0I  ^I S_0^1 - x_0I  ^I S_0^2
+ 2 _n 0   c_n _-n ^1I  ^I S_n ^1
+ i 2c_n _n  _-n ^2I  ^I S_n^2 , 

gen-closed-dyn 
&& 2p^+ Q^-2  = p_0I  ^I S_0^2 + x_0I  ^I S_0^1
+ 2 _n 0   c_n _-n ^2I  ^I S_n ^2
- i 2c_n _n  _-n ^1I  ^I S_n^1
.
Now, from Eqs. gen-closed-zero -gen-closed-dyn ,
it is straightforward to check the supersymmetry algebra of the
closed string in plane wave background metsaev2  using the
(anti-)commutation relations, commutator-mode-boson 
and commutator-mode-fermion . (Or one can directly calculate it
from the super-Nother charges, Eqs.

The supersymmetry algebra closed-dyn-qq  is particularly
of importance in describing string interactions in light-cone
string field theory formalism spradlin1 .
Note that the supersymmetry algebra
in closed-dyn-qq  distinguishes the two  directions
with opposite sign.(In order to derive Eq. closed-dyn-qq ,
one may use the formula, fierz1 , pi-omega1 ,
and gamma-rel1 . The opposite sign is indeed due to Eqs.
pi-omega1  and gamma-rel1 .) 
This sign flip may be read off from Eq. (2.13) in metsaev1  or Eq. (2.59)
in metsaev2  since  in
the space with  negative chirality as explained in Appendix
A. The dynamical supersymmetry algebra in Eq. closed-dyn-qq 
is consistent with the  symmetry which interchanges
simultaneously the two groups of four directions chu1 
z2 
Z_2 : (x^1,x^2,x^3,x^4) (x^5,x^6,x^7,x^8).
This should be the case since the worldsheet string action
gs-action  and the hamiltonian  are  invariant.
Indeed the plane wave supergravity spectrums in metsaev2 
explicitly respect this  symmetry (see also footnote 2 in
chu1 ). The presence of the opposite sign in Eq. closed-dyn-qq 
is different from spradlin1,pankiewicz2 
although these parts are not corrected by the interaction, so do
not affect their results.






Open string 



In the presence of D-brane of type  in the plane wave
background pp-metric , the symmetries of open string on the
D-branes are further broken by the boundary conditions of the open
string. First of all, the translation and the boost to the
transverse directions of D-brane, generated by  and
, are no longer the symmetries of open string
modes.(However, the translation and the boost generated
by  and
 are still the symmetries of the action gs-action 
and the isometry of the target spacetime. Thus the symmetry
transformation by the broken generators,  and
 as well as , results in new
D-branes, symmetry related D-branes, which are in general
time-dependent branes. See skenderis1,skenderis2 
for a detailed discussion on the
symmetry related D-branes.) 




Furthermore the rotational symmetry  is
more broken to .
Thus we will get  as expected.
The supersymmetry breaking is more complicated depending on a
specific boundary condition, that is,  boundary conditions.
It turned out skenderis1,skenderis2  that -branes preserve
8 kinematical and 8 dynamical supersymmetries regardless of
location. However, among -branes, D1-branes and D5-branes of
type  or  only preserve 8 kinematical and 8
dynamical supersymmetries while the other -branes preserve
only 8 kinematical supersymmetries.





-brane 


In order to derive the super-Nother charges in terms of open
string modes, as done in dabholkar , we will use a proper doubling
of the interval  to ,
such that all the classical solutions satisfy the open string
boundary conditions for the interval  and periodic
boundary conditions for .
The hamiltonian  for a D-brane located away from the origin
does depend on the Dirichlet zero modes
, so we first isolate the part,
denoted as , for the reason explained above
and directly calculate it:
delta-h 
2 p^+ H &=& 1 2  
_0 ^  d(x^ 2 _0 r^ 
+ ^2 x_0 r^ ^2), &=&   e^ -1 e^ +1 
x_0 r^ ^2.
For remaining parts, we will use the doubling trick.





It is then straightforward to get the expressions of the super-Nother
charges in terms of the mode expansions in Eqs. open-boson  and
open-fermion . The result is dabholkar 
gen-open-d- 
&& P^+ =p^+, P^r =p_0^r,J^+r = -x_0^r p^+, 

&& Q^+=2p^+ (1+i^T)S_0,
Q^-=2p^+ (1-i^T)S_0, 

&& J^rs  = x_0^r p_0^s - x_0^s p_0^r - i S_0 ^rs  S_0
- i _n 0   1 2_n 
(_-n ^r _n^s - _-n ^s _n^r)
+  S_-n  ^rs  S_n ,

&& J^r^s^  = - i S_0 ^r^s^  S_0
- i _n 0   1 2 _n

+ S_-n  ^r^s^  S_n ,

&& 2p^+ H= 2p^+ H + (p_0r ^2 + ^2 x_0r ^2) - 2i S_0 S_0
+ _n 0  
_-n ^I _n^I + 2 _n S_-n  S_n , 

&& 2p^+ Q^-1  = p_0^r ^r S_0 + x_0^r ^r S_0
- _n 0   c_n _-n ^I ^I S_n 
- i  2c_n _n _-n ^I ^I S_n  , 

&& 2p^+ Q^-2  = p_0^r ^r ^T S_0 + x_0^r ^r S_0
+ _n 0   c_n _-n ^I ^I S_n 
- i  2c_n _n _-n ^I ^T ^I S_n 
,
where  or  and 
or . Note that  and  as well as  and
 are not independent of but are related to each other
since
Q^+ + Q^- + i (Q^+ - Q^-) =0, Q^-1 + Q^-2  =0.
Thus we take the following independent supercharges, which are
preserved supersymmetries for -branes,
open-supercharges 
&& q^+ = (Q^+ + Q^- - i (Q^+ - Q^-) )
= 2 2 p^+  S_0, 

&& q^- = Q^-2  - ^T Q^-1  = 2 Q^-2 .
Similarly we present only the non-vanishing (anti-)commutation
relations involved with the odd generators, :
open-jq 
&& [J^rs , q^ ]=i 2  ^rs  q^ ,
[J^r^s^ , q^ ]=
i 2  ^r^s^ q^ , 

&& [J^+r , q^-]= i 2  ^T ^r q^+, 

&& [P^r, q^-]=-i  2 p^+  ^r q^+,
[H, q^+]= i  2p^+  q^+, 

&& q^+_a, q^+_b=_ab  2P^+, 

&& q^+_a, q^-_ = (^r)_a   P^r -  p^+ 
(^r)_a  J^+r , 

 open-dyn-qq 
&& q^-_ , q^-_ = _  2(H-H) +  2p^+ 
( (^rs _I )_  J^rs _I +
(^r^s^ _I )_  J^r^s^ _I
) &&  -  2p^+ 
( (^rs _II  )_  J^rs _II  +
(^r^s^ _II  )_  J^r^s^ _II  ),
where 
, and .
Note that the open string supersymmetry algebra
in open-dyn-qq  also distinguishes the two  directions
with opposite sign. The supersymmetry algebra open-dyn-qq 
shows that the BPS bound is saturated by the states with energy
. This implies that the brane located away from the
origin does not tend to move towards the origin skenderis2 .






-brane 




As identified by Skenderis and Taylor skenderis1,skenderis2 ,
the open strings on -brane preserve a different kind of
kinematical supersymmetries not descending from the closed string.
(We thank K. Skenderis and M. Taylor for related discussions.) 
The conserved Nother current is
current-d+ 
&& q^+_= 2p^+      
e^()  (S^1 + S^2), 

&& q^+_= 2p^+      
e^()  (S^1 - S^2).
It is simple to check that
conser-d+ 
q^+_   + q^+_ 
 =0,
using the equations of motion eom-fermion  and that
bc-current 
q^+__  = 0.
This together with the current conservation implies that the
charge
kin-charge-d+ 
q^+ = 1  _0^  d q^+_is conserved and in particular all non-zero modes cancel against
each other. In Appendix C, we will directly derive the kinematical
supercurrent current-d+  from the open string mode expansion.







For dynamical supersymmetry of
-brane, it has been known sken-tayl,hikida,gaberdiel 
that half of the dynamical supersymmetries are preserved by
D1-branes and D5-branes of type  or  only.
For the supersymmetric -branes, the 
matrices in Eq. omega  are the following:
omega-d+-d1 
&& D1-brane of type (0,0) : _ab =_ab , _  = - _ , 

omega-d+-d5+ 
&& D5-brane of type (4,0) : _ab  = _ab  =
^_ab , _  = _  =
- ^_ , 

omega-d+-d5- 
&& D5-brane of type (0,4) : _ab  = ^_ab  =
_ab , _  = ^_  =
- _ .
Since the open string action is just defined by the closed string
action imposed the open string boundary conditions
bc-boson  and bc-fermion ,
the super-Nother charges of an open string will be given by a
subset of the symmetries of the closed string action which are
compatible with the open string boundary conditions. A direct way
to find conserved charges for open strings is just to calculate
the super-Nother charges, Eqs. charge-p -charge-q-2 , in
terms of open string modes and then to find a combination of open
string coordinates to cancel time dependent parts,
i.e., the parts containing .
This procedure is completely reasonable since the mode expansions
of open string coordinates are consistent with
the boundary conditions bc-boson  and bc-fermion .
If we apply this recipe, for example, to the dynamical
supersymmetry of -branes, the conserved charge, for example,
for D1-brane case is given by
d1-q- 
2p^+ q^- &=& 2p^+ (Q^-2 - Q^-1 ) &=& 1  
_0 ^  d( X _I ^I (S^2-S^1)
+ X^_I ^I (S^1 + S^2)
+ X_I^I (S^1 + S^2) ).
This expression coincides with skenderis1,skenderis2,gaberdiel .





Since the nature of the mode expansion depends sensitively on the
particular branes on which the open string terminates, we will
discuss the supersymmetry algebra case by case. First we will
discuss D1-brane. Since the mode expansion of bosonic fields in
this case is exactly the same as that of -branes except for
, it is sufficient to newly calculate the
fermionic parts only. Using the methodology mentioned
in Eq. action-dec , it is straightforward to calculate
the hamiltonian for D1-brane and the result is
d+-hamilton 
2p^+ H= 2p^+ H + _n 0 
 _-n ^I _n^I + 2 _n S_-n  S_n , 

Note that the open string mass term, ,
is absent, so the ground states form a degenerate supermultiplet
while the ground state of the open string for -brane is an
unmatched boson due to the mass term.





Similarly, one can obtain the mode expansion for the rotation
generators:
d+-j1 
J^r^s^  = - i S _0 ^r^s^  S _0
- i _n 0   1 2 _n 
(_-n ^r^  _n^s^  - _-n ^s^  _n^r^ )
+ S_-n  ^r^s^  S_n ,
where  is defined by Eq. new-s0  and
their anti-commutation relation is given by Eq. anti-com-new .
And the supercharge d1-q-  is
d1-dyn-susy 
2p^+ q^- &=& 2 2 2     x_0^r^  ^r^  S _0 && +_n 0 ( c_n
^r^ _-n ^r^ (S_n + S _n)-
i 2c_n _n ^r^ _-n ^r^ 
(S_n - S _n)).
Note that the dynamical supersymmetries in this case are preserved
regardless of transverse location skenderis1 .



The supersymmetry algebra for D1-brane is closed where 
 identically:
di-jq 
&& [J^r^s^ , q^ ]=
i 2  ^r^s^ q^ , 

&& [H, q^]=0, 

&& q^+_a, q^+_b=_ab  2P^+, 

&&  q^+_a, q^-_   = 2p^+ 
2  2     x_0^r^  ^r^ _a  , 

&& q^-_ , q^-_ = _  2H.
Now we will consider the D5-brane of type (0,4) for definiteness
which presumably represents the Penrose limit of a baryon vertex
(the (4,0) brane can be treated similarly). In this case the
boundary term bi-boundary  contributes to the hamiltonian
which is now given by
d5-h 
2p^+ H= 1  
_0 ^  d[
X _r^2 + (_X_r - X_r)^2 +
(X _r^ ^2 + X^_r^  ^2 + ^2 X_r^ ^2)
+ i S^A S ^A ].
Since the mode expansion in this case is essentially the same as
the case of D1-brane except for the Neumann coordinates,
 in Eq. mode-d+ , it is sufficient to newly
calculate the parts involved with the Neumann coordinates. The
result for the hamiltonian is
d5-h-mode 
 2p^+ H= 2p^+ H + p_0r ^2
+ _n 0  
_-n ^I _n^I + 2 _n S_-n  S_n .
Similarly, for the rotation generators, we get
d5-j-mode 
&& J^rs  = x_0^r p_0^s - x_0^s p_0^r - i S _0 ^rs  S _0
- i _n 0   1 2_n 
(_-n ^r _n^s - _-n ^s _n^r)
+  S_-n  ^rs  S_n , 

&& J^r^s^  = - i S _0 ^r^s^  S _0
- i _n 0   1 2 _n 
(_-n ^r^  _n^s^  - _-n ^s^  _n^r^ )
+ S_-n  ^r^s^  S_n .
For the dynamical supersymmetry of open strings on D5-brane,
noting the  matrices in Eqs. omega-d+-d5+  and
omega-d+-d5- , one can easily check that the preserved dynamical
supersymmetry is
 for the  brane
while  for the  brane.
For example, for the  brane, one can get
conser-d5 
q^-_   = - q^-_ 
 ,
where
d5-qcurrent 
q^-_&=& -2 p^+   ( (_X^r -X^r)^r(S^2+S^1)
+ (_X^r^  + X^r^ )^r^ (S^2-S^1) && + _X^r ^r (S^2 - S^1)+
_X^r^  ^r^  (S^2 + S^1) )
and so
bc-current-d5 
q^-__  = 0.
In this case the dynamical supercharge is given by
d5-dyn-mode 
2p^+ q^- &=& 2p^+ (Q^-2  + Q^-1 ) &=& 2 p_0^r ^r S _0 +
 2 2 2     x_0^r^  ^r^  S _0 && + 2_n 0   c_n _-n ^I ^I S_n 
+ i  2c_n _n _-n ^I ^I S_n 
.
The supersymmetry algebra is closed as in D1-brane:
d5-susy-alg 
&& [J^rs , q^ ]=
i 2  ^rs q^ , [J^r^s^ , q^ ]=
i 2  ^r^s^ q^ , 

&& [J^+r , q^-]= - i 2  ^r q^+, 

&& [P^r, q^]=[H, q^]=0,

&& q^+_a, q^+_b=_ab  2P^+, 

&&  q^+_a, q^-_   = (^r)_a   P^r
+ 2p^+  2  2     x_0^r^  (^r^ )_a  ,

&& q^-_ , q^-_ = _  2H.
Note that the supersymmetry algebra for  of -branes does
not contain the angular momentum parts and all the supersymmetries
commute with the light-cone hamiltonian unlike -branes.
Consequently the vacuum for -branes is degenerate, containing
eight bosons and eight fermions as in flat space, and forms a
supermultiplet. The vacuum for -branes is, however, a singlet
under the  supersymmetry and  is a spectrum generating
operator.








Discussion 



In this paper we carefully analyzed the supersymmetry algebra of
plane wave superstrings. We found that the supersymmetry algebra
of closed string respects the 
symmetry where the  exchanges the first
 with the second . In addition we exhaustively analyzed the
supersymmetry algebra of open strings on half BPD D-branes, both
-branes and -branes. We showed that the algebra is
closed including a new kind of kinematical supersymmetry restored
by incorporating worldsheet symmetry suggested by Skenderis and
Taylor skenderis1,skenderis2  and all the supersymmetries
for -branes commute with the light-cone hamiltonian unlike
-branes. Throughout this paper we used the 8-component
spinors,  Majorana-Weyl spinors, so we hope the
supersymmetry algebras presented here will be useful for some
string field theory calculation in the plane wave background.






In this paper we considered only open strings whose end points are
attached on the same D-branes. One may consider open strings
connecting Dp-Dp branes, p-p strings, in the plane wave
background. The p-p string was analyzed
in bergman,gaberdiel  by the boundary state description and
the computation of cylinder diagrams, mainly for instantonic
branes. It will be interesting to explicitly study the
supersymmetry algebra of p-p strings as done in this paper, since
these open strings, especially being BPS states, are dual to a
defect conformal field theory in a plane wave
background dewolfe,lee2,sken-tayl .
We will report this result elsewhere cha .

:  vector indices,

:  vector indices.

: worldsheet (spinor, vector, etc.) indices.




In this paper we consider a Dp-brane of type ,
with  Neumann directions in  and  Neumann directions in
. Thus we distinguish the Neumann directions and the Dirichlet
directions with indices: 

:
vector indices in Neumann directions,


: vector indices in Dirichlet directions.





The spacetime metric is  where
 are  vector indices. We decompose  into
the light-cone and transverse coordinates:

x+- 
X^ =1 2  (X^0 X^9).
The worldsheet metric is  where .






We adopt the chiral representation for  Dirac matrices
 used in metsaev1,metsaev2 
10d-gamma 
^=  0 & ^                        ^& 0  
where the  matrices,


, satisfy
10d-clifford 
^ ^+ ^ ^= 2
^  =  ^^+  ^^.
The  chirality matrix 
 is given by
gamma11  &&
_11  =  1_16  & 0                        0 & -1_16   , 

&& ^0  ^1 ^8  ^9 =
1_16 ,&&  ^0 ^1  ^8 ^9 =
-1_16  .
We further assume the following block decomposition for 
8d-gamma 
^I =  0 & ^I_a                          ^I_a  & 0  
where  matrices,

8d-clifford 
&& ^I_a   ^J_b  + ^J_a   ^I_b 
= 2^IJ _ab , && ^I_a  ^J_a   +  ^J_a 
^I_a   = 2^IJ _ .
Since we use  chiral spinors, we take the  chirality
matrix 
 as
gamma9 
 1_8  & 0                        0 & -1_8   .
We use the following definitions

&& _ab ^= ^5 ^6 ^7  ^8,
_ ^=  ^5 ^6

Due to the normalization gamma9 , 
. Note that the matrix
 is symmetric and traceless and .
We define the antisymmetrized products of gamma matrices, e.g.,
gammas 
&& ^IJ _ab =(^I_a   ^J_b

-  ^J_a  ^I_a  ), 

&& ^IJK _a  =1 3!  (^I_a   ^J_b 
^K_b  5 terms ), && ^IJK _b =1 3!  ( ^I_a  ^J_a  
 ^K_b  5 terms ).

 while
. Similarly they are true
with dotted indices.





The 16-component spinor  is decomposed in terms of the
8-component spinors as
so8-spinor 
^=(
 
),
where  is a positive
chirality spinor and  is a negative
chirality spinor. Here  is defined by
lc-gamma 
^= 1 2  (^0 ^9).
In computing the supersymmetry algebra we need to use the Fierz
identity. For spinors  and  with positive chirality,
fierz1 
S_1^a S_2^b = 1 8 _ab S_1S_2 +
1 16 S^1^IJ S_2 ^IJ _ab  +1 384 S_1
^IJKL  S_2 ^IJKL _ab .
Also the similar expression is true for negative chirality
spinors. Another useful identity green2  is
fierz2 
^I_a   ^J_b   &=& 1 8 (^IJ 
_ab _  + _ab ^IJ _ 
+_  ^IJ _ab ) &+& 1 16 ^IJ (^KL _ab ^KL _

+^JKLM _ab  ^IKLM _ ) &+& 1 16 (^IJKL _ab ^KL _ 
+^KL _ab  ^IJKL _ ).
In order to discuss the boundary condition of open strings living
on a Dp-brane, it is needed to introduce the matrix 
defined by
omega 
_ab =(_I  ^I )_ab ,
_ =(_I  ^I )_ ,
where  denotes the set of Neumann directions. Note that
. Thus, for the -branes,  is
an antisymmetric matrix, i.e., , while,
for -branes, . The following
commutation relations are useful in the calculation
pi-omega1 
&&  ^i, =0, [^i^ , ]=0, 

pi-omega2 
&&   ^r, =0, [^r^ , ]=0.
We often use the subscripts  and  to distinguish the two
different  directions of Neumann and Dirichlet coordinates,
e.g., , etc.
Using pi-omega1  and pi-omega2 , the
following formula can be derived
gamma-rel1 
&& f_IJ  ^K ^IJ  ^K = f_IJ  ^K ^IJ 
^K = 4(f_ij ^ij 
- f_i^j^ ^i^j^ ), 

gamma-rel2 
&&  ^t ^rs _I ^t = (4-m+n) ^rs _I
, ^t^  ^r^s^ _I ^t^ 
= (4+m-n) ^r^s^ _I , etc. 
where  is a fermion bilinear.




Finally we list useful integral formula which are used in the
calculation of -branes:
integral-1 
&& _0^  n    d = (-)^n ^2 ^2 ^2 + n^2 
, 

&& _0^  n    d = -(-)^n n ^2 ^2 + n^2 , 

&& _0^  n    d = - n  ^2 ^2 + n^2 
((-)^n  -1 ), 

integral-4 
&& _0^  n    d = ^2 ^2 ^2 + n^2 
((-)^n  -1 ).

(Anti-)Commutation Relations for -branes 




To determine the anti-commutation relation of the zero modes, Eq.
d+10 , let us calculate the anti-commutator for the spinor
field , Eq. commutator-open2 , using the mode
expansion open-fermion2  and the anti-commutation relations,
Eqs. d+1n0 -d+t2 , for the nonzero modes:
commut-st 
 S^1a (,), S^1b (^, )
 &=& (+^) S_0^a , S_0^b 
  + (+^)()_ac  S_0^c , S_0^b 
  &&+1 4  _ab  _n Z  
e^i n  (-1 4  _ab  _n Z   ^2 _n^2 
e^i n  (+^)  && -i 4 ()_ab  _n Z   n / _n^2 
e^i n  (+^) ,
where we assumed the form of  as 
. Now we will use the following integral representation to evaluate
the infinite sums in commut-st :
sum1 
_n Z   ^2 _n^2 
e^i n  (+^)  &=& - _C
dz 1-e^2i z   ^2 ^2 z^2+^2^2 
e^i(+^)z/  &=&  (e^-(+^)  
1-e^-2  - e^(+^)  
1-e^2   ),
sum2 
_n Z   n / _n^2 
e^i n  (+^)  &=& - _C dz 1-e^2i z   z z^2+^2^2  e^i(+^)z/  &=& i  (e^-(+^)  
1-e^-2   + e^(+^)  
1-e^2   ),
where the contour  consists of two lines passing
infinitesimally above and below the real axis. One can see that
the contribution from the zero modes is exactly cancelled by the
second and the third sums in commut-st  provided that the anti-commutator
of the zero modes is given as in d+10 . Thus we have the anti-commutation relation
Eq. commutator-open2 . Similarly, one can check that
.




Using the commutation relations in Eq. comm-open  and the
identities sum1  and sum2  together with
sum3 
_n Z   n^2/^2 _n^2 
e^i n  (+^)  &=& - _C
dz 1-e^2i z   z^2 z^2+^2^2 
e^i(+^)z/  &=& -  (e^-(+^)  
1-e^-2  - e^(+^)  
1-e^2   ),
 one can also check that
 in Eq. mode-d+  satisfies the quantization
rule commutator-open1 .



Kinematical Supersymmetry for -branes 


Here we directly derive the kinematical
supercurrent current-d+  for -branes from the open string mode expansion.
In section 2, we showed that the
fermionic mode expansions open-fermion2  satisfy the boundary
condition bc-fermion  as well as the equations
of motion eom-fermion  and the anti-commutation
relations between the modes are given by Eqs. d+10  and
d+1n0 . Thus the Nother charge for the kinematical
supersymmetry should be represented by some combination of 
and  fermions in Eq. open-fermion2 . We now examine
whether there can be any combination from  and  fermions
which reduces to a kinematical supersymmetry generator 
satisfying the standard superalgebra
kine-susy-d+ 
q^+_a, q^+_b=_ab  2P^+.
To proceed our argument, first note that the anti-commutation
relation in Eq. d+10  can be rewritten as
anti-com-s0 
 S_0^a , S_0^b   =  4 
(e^-   )_ab 
and thus a zero mode fermion defined by
new-s0 
S _0 =    
e^   S_0
satisfies the standard anti-commutation relation
anti-com-new 
S _0^a , S _0^b   = 1 4 
_ab .
Thus if the supersymmetry generator  would be given by
dyn-q0 
q^+ = 2 2p^+  S _0,
 in dyn-q0  then satisfies the superalgebra
kine-susy-d+ . Interestingly it turns out that such a supersymmetry
generator can be constructed from the fermions
in Eq. open-fermion2 .






Notice that the zero mode parts,  and  of 
 and , respectively, are given by
s1-s2 
&& S^1_0()=    
e^()  S _0, && S^2_0()=    
^T e^()  S _0.
Since the zero modes  and 
satisfy ,
as obviously seen in s1-s2 , we can deduce the form
of the charge density 
for the kinematical supersymmetry whose zero mode part would be
given by dyn-q0 :
density-q+ 
q^+_= A e^k ()  
(S^1 + S^2)(, ),
where .
Note that only  case is descending from the closed string.
Due to the structure of the integrals, Eqs.
integral-1 -integral-4 , the most plausible choices are
, or explicitly,
candidate1 
&& q^+_= 2p^+      
e^-()  (S^1 + S^2), 

candidate2 
&& q^+_=  p^+    
(S^1 + S^2), 

k=1 
&& q^+_= 2p^+      
e^()  (S^1 + S^2).
The first two candidates, however, obtain contributions from the
non-zero modes and so none of them is conserved. For example, the
first choice candidate1  gives us
second 
q^+ &=& 2 2p^+  S _0
+ 4 2p^+   
    && _n 0  c_n _n 
n ^2 ^2 + n^2 (
e^  - (-)^n
e^-   )
(S_n - i _n S_n ) e^-i_n  .
Here we used the integral formula integral-1 -integral-4 .
But the third choice k=1  precisely gives the conserved
kinematical supercharge
superkin-d+ 
q^+ = 2 2p^+  S _0,
first identified by Skenderis and Taylor
skenderis1,skenderis2 .
