In N=2 SYM theory with matter non-conservation of the S-charge of a BPS state under
monodromies leads to so-called BPS
state "decay". A mechanism for such a behavior on the semiclassical level could be
established through consideration of soliton-fermion bound state. Solutions
to classical equations of motion allow to observe the BPS state "decay" in
vivo.

Introduction 
In the work of Seiberg and Witten concerning N=2 SYM with matter in
fundamental representation of SU(2) the following formula for
central charge is established:
Z=n_ma_D+n_ea+_i=1 ^N_f m_iS_i 2  
where besides the magnetic and electric charges an abelian global charge appears.
This charge, called the S-charge or the spectral asymmetry, arises due to global 
symmetry which is generally broken down to  by the hypermultiplet mass term in the
action. The S-charge is carried only by the fields from hypermultiplet and
on equal footing with  and  it parameterizes the BPS spectrum
of the N=2 theory.

The moduli space possesses a certain number of singularities. In this paper
we are going to consider those singularities that correspond to massless
quarks. From the central charge formula () it follows that
 vanishes for the states with

at a special point  on the moduli space.

The complex coupling  has a logarithmic singularity at this point
(a)=-i 2 ln(a-a_0),



 a_D=c-i 2 (a-a_0)ln(a-a_0).
Considering  and  as the functions on the complex  plane and
investigating their monodromies around the point  we find

Since the central charge should be invariant, the charges of a quantum
state consisted of a monopole of magnetic charge  and quark with
charges  and  should be shifted by this rotation:

By multiple action of the monodromy in the presence of a magnetic charge
 in principle we could make the value of the S-charge arbitrarily
large.

On the other hand for the quark-monopole bound state the value of the S-charge is
bounded, since the only fields carrying S-charge are fermion modes, that obey
the Pauli exclusive principle. Therefore starting from one particle state and
encircling the singularity we come to two particle state.

In the limit  the singularity becomes semiclassical and hence
the simple dynamical analysis of the theory near the singularity is appropriate.
Below we consider the fermion equations
of motion in the background of monopole fields. We find explicitly a
normalizable fermion mode corresponding to the bound state, which carries
S-charge. It is from the analysis of the properties of the classical solution
that the mechanism of the BPS state decay becomes explicit.

Somewhat similar considerations were made by Heningson in, where
the conditions for the existence of normalizable solution were investigated.
The latter result is consistent with simple analysis of Marginal Stability
from BPS Mass Formula performed in.

In this paper we rederive the result of and present an obvious
picture which describes classically the phenomenon of the BPS state decay.



Derivation of the fermion mode 
Solution to Dirac equation 



Consider  SYM theory with  gauge group and matter hypermultiplets
in fundamental representation.(Here we restrict ourselves
to the case of . For more detailed review of  actions see for
example.) 
This theory contains monopoles in its spectrum. There are also solutions
that correspond to matter fermions in the external monopole field. The
question is whether these solutions can be normalizable. In other words,
whether there exist soliton-fermion bound states to which we refer as to one
particle states.
As we shall see below, such normalizable
solutions exist only in some region of the moduli space. The
point of singularity for the massless quark happens to belong to the boundary of this
region, providing a natural explanation for the bound state decay described
above.

The fermionic components of the hypermultiplet satisfy the Dirac equation
iD_- (m +2 A )= 0,



 m +2 A =e(m+2 A) +i^5m(m+2 A).
where the Dirac spinor  is composed of two Weyl spinors as follows:
 
).
These two Weyl spinors belong to fundamental and antifundamental N=1 chiral multiplets.

Working in the Gauss gauge , substitute  by the energy
eigenvalue . Now notice that the hamiltonian commutes with the operator
 in the case . Thus general
solution to () could be found as the sum of 
eigenfunctions .

Substituting  instead of  we split the equation ():
[^k D_k -e(m+2 A)] ^+=0,



 [ E - m(m+2 A)] ^+ =0.
Here  is a chiral Weyl component of .

In the consideration above we treat  as a real constant in contrast with
scalar field  which is generally complex. However it would be more
useful for the future computations to keep  real. Since there is a 
symmetry acting on the fields, we could choose such a U(1) rotation
Ae^2i  A,



 me^2i  m,



 e^-i^5 ,
under which complexity of  flows into complexity of . Although this
symmetry is in general anomalous, this is not the case in the semiclassical region.
Then solution to the second equation of () implies that
the bound-state mass spectrum satisfies

where  now defines a complex mass parameter.

In the case of real scalar field  we could use the standard radially symmetric
solution for 't Hooft-Polyakov monopolein the BPS limit(We neglect the back
reaction of matter fields to monopole fields assuming that in semiclassical limit the
ratio of corresponding masses is small.) :
2 A^i=an^i(1-F(r)),



 A^a_i=^aij n^j r (1-H(r)),
where  is a unit vector,  and  are known functions of radius
. For future convenience we chose the normalization of the scalar field 
in () slightly different from that in. In our
conventions it has asymptotic .
Furthermore Seiberg and Witten renormalize the charges of the BPS states in
such a way that . So our  will be different from
that of Seiberg and Witten by the factor of .


Substituting () into () we find a solution in
the form
(^+)^ _ a =^ _ a _0+ n^i
(^i)^_   ^ _ a _0,


where  and  are spinor and color indices respectively.
Functions  and , solving the equations at zero 
are defined as follows:(Here we define 
.) 
_0 = 1 sh   th  2 ,



 _0 = 1 sh   cth  2 .
Functions  and  satisfy the system of the first order differential
equations
cth ^2(2 ),



 th ^2(2 ),
which implies the pair of second order equations
^  + 2^ sh  -r_0^2m^2


 ^  - 2^ sh  -r_0^2m^2Explicit solutions to this equations could be found in terms of
hypergeometric functions. We shall find normalizable solutions after an
analysis of asymptotic behavior of the general solutions to (
).

The solution presented above is one of positive chirality. It could be
shown as well that for negative chirality the similar solution could not be made
normalizable.
It is also natural to assume that there are no other discrete spectrum
solutions to ().


Analysis of the Solution 
In this subsection we investigate the asymptotic of the solution to
() and rederive the conditions under which this solution exists
. Using the asymptotic we also derive the explicit solution in
terms of hypergeometric functions.

Introduce a pair of functions  that will characterize the
asymptotic behavior of solution ():
.
Since we are interested in soliton-fermion bound states,
the fermion mode we are looking for should be a normalizable one, i.e. it
should decrease fast enough at infinity and be regular at the origin,
namely

In the  limit the fermion mode behaves as the solution
to the equations
^  + 2^  -r_0^2m^2


 ^  - 2^  -r_0^2m^2The regular solutions to () are as follows:
sh (r_0m)  ,



 = C(r_0mr_0m + C(r_0m+1)e^-r_0m ,
with the coefficients fixed by asymptotical behavior of ().

Assume that
we have a solution that is regular at the origin. From the asymptotic
() it follows that the first derivative of this solution
is zero and the second derivative is positive at this point. Furthermore,
the second derivative in exact equations () is positive wherever
first derivative vanishes. Therefore such solutions could have only minima
and cannot be normalizable.
This means that
solution to () is either regular at the origin and divergent at
infinity or regular at infinity and divergent at the origin. However if
we look at (), we shall see that under certain conditions
we could construct a normalizable zero-mode. The regular at the origin and
increasing at infinity solution to () has the asymptotic
,e^r_0m .
It follows from () that the functions
, have the asymptotic
_0, _0 e^-    ,
and that for the functions ,
,1   e^(r_0m-1 2 ) .
We see that for the existence of normalizable zero mode the following conditions
should be satisfied:
2r_0 m < 1, or  2m a < 1,
or  in the standard normalization of. This result was
originally derived in, and then was confirmed by CMS considerations
in in the weak coupling limit.

Now turn to the equations (). Changing variables from
 to  we obtain a pair of hypergeometric
equations
x(x-1)y^ _1+(x+1 2 )y_1^


 x(x-1)y^ _2+(x-3 2 )y_2^Solving () and expressing the solution in terms of original
variable  we find the unknown functions  and :
()=CF(m a ,-m a ,-1 2 ,ch ^2 2 ),



 ()= C 
F(m a ,-m a ,3 2 ,ch ^2 2 ).
Here we took into account the asymptotic of solution determined above.
The asymptotic of () also fixes the relation .


BPS State Decay 
From the considerations above we found that normalizable fermion mode with
the energy defined by complex mass parameter  exists only
in the region of moduli space defined as(In the fermion equations 
was treated as  of real field . To define this condition for all complex
moduli plane we substitute the latter by absolute value of complex coordinate
.) 
eM  =m<a 2 .
Now for complete understanding of the process we need one more thing, namely
to find what region of the moduli space corresponds to the solutions to Dirac
equation () from continuous spectrum, i.e. non-bound BPS
states. Considering asymptotic of () at infinity we obtain the
system of linear differential equations, neglecting exponentially decaying
non constant coefficients. The corresponding characteristic equation gives
for fixed energy 
E=m-a 2 .
This condition defines a cone in the  or equivalently in the 
parameter space with the singularity at  (Fig.1). Further we substitute the
investigation on the complex  plane by that on the  plane, which
is equivalent due to  symmetry. Continuous spectrum
belongs to the interior of this cone. The region of discrete spectrum is
an inclined plane , which is bounded due to the condition (
).

 []
figure.eps 
The region of discrete spectrum (inclined semiplane) is continuously
attached to the region of continuous spectrum (cone) by the line 
which goes through the point . 

Now a closed contour on the complex  corresponds to some 3
dimensional curve, which is restricted to belong either to inclined plane of
discrete spectrum or to the interior of the continuous spectrum cone. Since
the contour must be closed and smooth, this curve must have a spiral form.
This means that encircling the singular point we cannot return to the
initial value of energy. Furthermore the final point of a spiral curve
belongs to the state from continuous spectrum, which means a decay of the
initial bound state.

To clarify what happens when we encircle the singularity consider the
dependence of energy  on the angle of rotation  in the
 plane (Fig.2). We start at some real mass value  and hence at zero
energy.
At  we reach the continuous spectrum. For 
from  to  there is no any bound state, i.e. the
initial bound state has decayed. After a full rotation  the
mode from continuous spectrum cannot descend to discrete spectrum and the only
allowed values of energy will be . However if we
move in the opposite direction starting from  we shall also come
to continuous spectrum at , but in the part of it which
is below zero level. Since we move adiabatically and all the states for fermion below
zero are occupied we conclude that after encircling the singularity one fermion
mode runs to continuous spectrum and another one comes from the Dirac sea below.

The initial bound state decays after crossing the point of

continuous spectrum below.
 


Conclusions 

Investigations of the properties of the classical solutions to (
) tells us that the adiabatic motion around the singularity is severely
restricted in acceptable values of energy . During this motion we
necessarily cross the Curve of Marginal Stability for bound state. For
an initial state this happens only once and that is why this state remains
finally unbounded. On the other hand another fermion line comes from the
continuous spectrum of Dirac sea below and forms a new bound state, thus
confirming the predicted shift in the S-charge
