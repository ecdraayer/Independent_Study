We obtain the exact non-perturbative solution of a
scalar field theory defined on a space with noncommuting position and momentum
coordinates. The model describes non-locally interacting charged
particles in a background magnetic field. It is an exactly solvable
quantum field theory which has non-trivial interactions only when it
is defined with a finite ultraviolet cutoff. We propose that
small perturbations of this theory can produce solvable models with
renormalizable interactions.



Quantum field theories on noncommutative spaces have received a surge
of interest in recent years, primarily because they can be obtained as
limits of string theory with background magnetic fields in which the
massive string modes decouple (see  for reviews and
exhaustive lists of references). They capture many of the non-local
effects possessed by string theory but in a much simpler setting, and
have attained a fundamental level of interest as examples of non-local
field theories which may be well-defined. Various versions of them
have also been proposed as effective field theory descriptions of some
planar condensed matter systems in strong magnetic fields, such as
quantum Hall models. Because of their embedding into string theory,
these models are sometimes believed to be unitary and
renormalizable.(Disclaimer: Views and opinions mentioned in
  this letter do not necessarily reflect those of the authors.)  However,
they possess several unusual aspects which continue to challenge the
conventional wisdom of quantum field theory, and question the
renormalizability and overall consistency of these field theories.

On a canonical noncommutative space, the usual pointwise product of fields
is replaced by the star-product
^Dk ^Dq (2)^D  (k)
k_^ q_  ^(k+q)
x   ,
where the tildes denote Fourier transforms and  is a
constant antisymmetric matrix.
The noncommutativity of space is encoded in the
fact that the commutators of coordinates computed with this
product are non-vanishing, as 
. In perturbation theory, the
phases in () produce momentum dependent vertices in
Feynman diagrams which affect the interactions of the quantum field
theory at energy scales below the scale  set by the
dimensionful noncommutativity parameter . The most
drastic example of this is known as
ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing. If one uses Fourier expansion of
fields in a basis of plane waves , as in
(), then the natural regularization of the quantum
field theory is the restriction of momenta  to an annulus
, where  is an IR cutoff and
 a UV cutoff. Removing the cutoffs amounts to
taking the limits  and . Planar
diagrams essentially coincide with those of ordinary quantum field
theory, while non-planar graphs are modified by phases containing
internal and external line momenta and are generically convergent. The
rapid phase oscillations in () imply that a
high-momentum cutoff  generates an effective IR cutoff
. This appears to ruin the
usual Wilsonian renormalization procedure which would require a clear
separation of high and low momentum scales.

However, the puzzling UV/IR mixing properties may simply be an
artifact of perturbation theory which disappears when summed to all
orders. This is a non-perturbative issue which is in general
difficult to address. In this letter we will formulate a
noncommutative scalar field theory which is exactly solvable and obtain its
non-perturbative solution explicitly. The model describes charged
scalar particles in a background magnetic field with a four-point
interaction defined by the star-product . We will circumvent the
problems set in by UV/IR mixing by using a basis for the expansion of
fields on  which differs from the more conventional plane
wave basis and which will allow us to make sense of the field theory at a
fully non-perturbative level. This expansion provides a natural
non-perturbative regularization of the quantum field theory, producing
both a short-distance and low-momentum cutoff
simultaneously. We will show how to extract from this the exact
expressions for Green's functions of the quantum field theory.

The model is defined by the Euclidean action
S=^2 x [^*(H_B+m^2)+g2
^*^*]  ,
where  is a charged scalar field on flat space  and
H_B=(-_ x^)^2
is the Landau Hamiltonian for a charged particle moving in two
dimensions under the influence of a constant perpendicularly applied
magnetic field . For brevity, we will only work in 
dimensions. The noncommutativity parameter is then given by
. Because the commutators
of the covariant momentum operators
 are equal to 
, we may interpret the field theory
() as being defined on a noncommutative space whose
corresponding momentum space is also given by noncommuting
coordinates. However, the ensuing analysis carries through to arbitrary even
dimensionality , and remarkably most of our
conclusions hold quite generally. This follows from the fact that in
any even dimension  there is a choice of coordinates which
skew-diagonalizes the problem into a product of  two-dimensional
ones, to which the analysis of this letter applies with the
appropriate changes. The details will be presented in a separate
publication .

We shall find that the UV fixed point of this theory is
trivial. The only scaling limit possible is one in which the coupling
constant  vanishes as the UV cutoff is removed. We shall find that
there is no intermediate scale in between the two natural UV and IR
cutoffs in this model, consistent with the UV/IR
duality found in , and the field theory is not renormalizable
because the fields are correlated on the scale of the cutoff. This
result is similar in spirit to earlier observations that asymptotically-free
noncommutative field theories are trivial, and
that generic ones are only well-defined when they contain
both a finite UV and IR cutoff .
The renormalized propagator as an exact function of
external momentum is given in the scaling limit by
G(p)=(p^2+m^2)^2+4M^4 -(p^2+m^2) 2M^4   ,
where  is the bare scalar particle mass and  is a dynamically
generated mass scale. The non-free form of () takes
into account a non-perturbative resummation of leading power
divergences in the scaling limit which are generated by the
degeneracies of the Landau levels. Such a renormalization procedure,
though formally consistent, is physically  meaningless and has little chance to
 produce an interacting quantum field theory in the scaling limit. The
 scalar field theory is thereby an example of a noncommutative field
 theory, with a finite cutoff, which is exactly solvable. The exact
 propagator at finite cutoff, which is computed below, produces
 () in the scaling limit and has a qualitatively
 similar but somewhat more complicated form. It exhibits a novel
 oscillatory behaviour in position space on top of its long-distance
 exponential decay, which may be attributed to
 the appearence of an Aharonov-Bohm phase acquired by the charged
 particles in the magnetic background, similar to those observed
 numerically in . Slight modifications of the model, such as
 the inclusion of a background harmonic oscillator potential that
 lifts the Landau level degeneracy, may produce good scaling limits.

Because of the magnetic field in the action,
a natural basis of normal modes
 is comprised of the orthonormal eigenfunctions
 of the Landau Hamiltonian (),
H_B_,n =4B( )_,n   ,
with  positive integers. Some properties of the Landau
eigenfunctions  are briefly described in an appendix at
the end of this letter. These wavefunctions form the position space
representation of the occupation
number states  of two decoupled harmonic oscillators,
and with them we can expand the complex scalar fields of
() as
(x)=4   A^  _n  
_,n ^*(x)
with  and  dimensionless
complex numbers.

In this basis, the free part of the action () is
diagonal, but the four-point star-product interaction term is
rather complicated. However, a special simplification occurs when the
parameters of the model are related through .
In this case, the Landau wavefunctions have a remarkably simple
behaviour under star-products, 
, which
can be derived by an explicit calculation and reflects the
fact that the one-particle wavefunctions
 form the Wigner representations
of the Fock space operators . As we show below,
the quantum field theory defined by () is exactly
solvable precisely when the magnetic field and noncommutativity
parameter are related in this way, and we shall assume this
relation for the remainder of this letter. The action
() then takes the simple form
S=[EA^A+2g
(A^A)^2]  ,
where we have naturally assembled the expansion coefficients of
() into an infinite complex matrix  and
defined . The
noncommutativity of space is now manifested in the noncommutativity of
matrix multiplication in ().

This suggests that we may define the regularized quantum field
theory with action () by restricting the quantum
numbers of the Landau wavefunctions to  with
. The path integral is then defined as the 
limit of the  matrix integral
Z_N=_,n=1 ^NA_n ^   A_    n ^*  ^-[EA^A+2g
(A^A)^2]   .
The finite matrix dimension  provides both a short-distance and
low-momentum cutoff simultaneously, because in matrix regularizations
of noncommutative field theory the UV and IR divergences are not
clearly separated and one needs to regulate them both at the same
time . There are, however, many different ways to
take the large  limit of the matrix model with partition function
(), and we need to decide which is the appropriate
one that captures the true non-perturbative physics of the original
continuum field theory.

The large  limit is meaningful only when the entropy from the
growth in the number of integration variables is compensated by a
large action. In matrix models, an action of order , typically of the form
, is necessary to balance quantum
fluctuations . Hence we need to require that
 as  in (). In other
words, we must take the large  limit while keeping fixed the ratio
^2=N/4 ,
which simply defines the  limit of the noncommutative
field theory. This limit is a generic feature of the matrix
regularization of noncommutative field theories .
The important feature of the model with a background magnetic field is
that the whole action has a nice matrix representation, in contast to
other noncommutative field theories, in which the kinetic term has no
matrix representation , and to ordinary field theories with
background fields, in which the kinetic term is simple in the Landau basis,
but the interactions are complicated .

There are two important consequences of this correlated large  and
large  limit. First of all,
this limit is just the standard 't Hooft planar limit of the
matrix model. Secondly, the natural UV cutoff of the original
noncommutative field theory is the energy of the  Landau
level, which is  and stays finite 
as  goes to infinity. Thus the quantity () is the
true UV cutoff of the quantum field theory. This will be confirmed
below by explicit calculations. Since  as
, the spacing between Landau levels also vanishes. Thus
taking the limit described above is equivalent to filling the finite
energy interval  with infinitely many Landau
levels and an infinite density of states.

Thus the large  limit of the model defined by
() is a quantum field theory with a finite cutoff
whose exact solution is given by the 't Hooft limit of the complex
external field matrix model (). As an example, we
will explicitly compute the exact two-point function defined by
G(x,y)=^*(x)(y)4_,n,A_n ^*
A^  _,n ^  (x)^  _n', .
Both the action and integration measure in the path integral
() are invariant under unitary transformations
 with .
This is just a consequence of the degeneracy of Landau levels.
We can make this transformation
explicit in the matrix integral and then integrate over the unitary
group. We then use the well-known properties of the Haar measure of
 and the fact that, by  invariance, the partition function
() depends generically only on the  eigenvalues
 of the external field  and is symmetric under
permutation of them. It follows that the matrix averages appearing in
() are given as 

, where
W(_)=1NZ_N _ 
and after differentiation the eigenvalues should be set equal to
. In what
follows it will prove convenient to shift
.

The computation of () thereby boils down to the
calculation of the function () and the sum over Landau
levels 
in the limit ,  with
 fixed. Using known properties of the Landau
wavefunctions, the sum can be evaluated in this scaling limit in terms
of the Bessel function  of the first kind of order 0 (see the
appendix). In the large  limit, we replace sums over Landau levels
by integrals in the standard way according to the rule
, so that
() becomes
G(x,y)=-_0^16  4  W(+
m^2 ^2 )J_0(x-y)  .
After a change of variables  and by using the
angular integral representation of the Bessel function, we can express
() as a two-dimensional integral
G(x,y)=-1^2 _p<4 ^2p 
(2)^2  W(p^2+m^2 ^2 ) 
^p(x-y)   .
This result has several remarkable implications. First of all, it
demonstrates that the limit of large noncommutativity, in which the
underlying space is expected to degenerate and all
symmetries to be maximally violated, yields rotationally and
translationally invariant Green's functions. There are remnants of
UV/IR mixing in the far IR at , but these
distances have been scaled out and all results here are valid at
length scales far below the noncommutativity scale. Secondly, we see
that the quantity  is a sharp cutoff in the
momentum integral (), showing clearly that
() is the UV cutoff of the field theory. Finally,
the matrix model partition function has the physical interpretation of
providing the exact propagator in momentum space through the function
(),
G(p)=-1^2 W(p^2+m^2 ^2 
)  ,    p^2<16^2  .
It is instructive to consider a simple instance of this
identification. At zero coupling, the matrix integral
() can be explicitly evaluated to 
, so that . This recovers the expected
free propagator .

It remains to compute () in the general case.
This can be done rather explicitly, because this function satisfies in
the large  limit a closed equation, which is the Schwinger-Dyson
equation of the matrix model given by
g ^2 (W^2()+_m^2/^2 ^16+m^2/
^2  16 
  W()-W() =W()+1  .
The loop equation () gives a straightforward way to
generate the perturbative expansion to arbitrary orders of the
original noncommutative field theory as an iterative solution of
() in the coupling constant . By using
(), the propagator up to one-loop order is easily
determined in this way as
G(p)=1p^2+m^2 -g16 (16
^2/m^2) (p^2+m^2)^2 -g^2 (p^2+m^2)^3 +
O(g^2)  .
The second term in () recovers the usual one-loop
logarithmic UV divergence of  theory in two dimensions which
is generated by the planar (field theoretical) bubble diagram and
would lead to the renormalization group running of the mass. The third
term is an additional quadratic UV divergence which is the non-planar
(field theoretical) contribution. The additional divergences in
 are even worse at higher loop orders. They arise from the
summations over degenerate Landau levels, whose degree of divergence grows
with the order of perturbation theory and differs from that of
usual scalar field theory.

The Schwinger-Dyson equation () can be solved by means
of the methods developed in to give
W()&=&^2 2g 
(^2+a+b )

&&+12 _m^2/^2 ^16+m^2/^2 
 16  
1^2+a+b  ^2+a
+b -^2+a+b   .
The parameters  and  are unambiguously determined by
substituting () into (), which
determines them through the algebraic equations
_m^2/^2 ^16+m^2/^2 
 16  1^2+a+b  
&=&a^2 2 g   , 

_m^2/^2 ^16+m^2/^2 
 16   ^2+a
+b  &=&^2 2 g (b-34a^2)-1  .
The solution () with these constraints matches the
perturbation expansion of () and has the correct
asymptotic behaviour  for
. The loop amplitude  is an analytic
function of  on the complex plane with a square-root branch
cut. The two branch points are the roots of the polynomial
 and are always complex, as follows from the
constraints () and ().

 From () it follows that the long-distance asymptotics
of the propagator are determined by the singularities of
. Since the two branch points occur at complex ,
the two-point function oscillates on top of its exponential
decay. Consequently, for  we may write
, where  is determined
by the condition that  solves the quadratic
equation . Careful inspection of the loop equations
shows that the correlation length  is always of order of the cutoff scale
unless the coupling  is very small, ,
and thus we define
g=M^4/^2  .
 From the constraint equations () and ()
we find that  and  in this scaling
limit. As a consequence, the renormalized two-point function,
which is the  limit of (),
reduces to (). By examining () one
may infer that the scaling limit () resums the leading power
divergences arising in the perturbation series. The explicit form of
the propagator () at finite cutoff  is given by
()-().

The power divergences arising in perturbation theory spoil the
renormalizability of this field theory, but there can be many ways to get rid
of them. For instance, we can replace the Landau Hamiltonian
() in () by the combination
, with  a small parameter. Physically,
this corresponds to the addition of a confining electric potential to
the background of the charged scalar fields. This extension lifts the
degeneracy of the Landau levels, yet the regulated version of the field theory
 still reduces to the matrix model () with an additional
term  in the action. While this term spoils the
 invariance of the matrix model, the latter still has a regular
large  limit and is potentially solvable by an extension of the techniques
presented in this letter by perturbative expansion in . The
special case  corresponds to charged particles in a harmonic
oscillator potential alone and is closest to the conventional
noncommutative field theories with no background magnetic field.

eigenfunctions. By introducing two sets of creation and
annihilation operators ,

and ,
, with

 the Landau Hamiltonian () can be written as
 12. The

characterized by the occupation numbers associated with the  and
 oscillators and can be conveniently written in terms of the
