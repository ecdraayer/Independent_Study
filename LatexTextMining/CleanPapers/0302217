backgrounds yielding   extended superconformal symmetries
in the dual boundary CFT. In each case the necessary constraints
on the internal worldsheet theory  are found.

Introduction 
The special status of the  duality in the AdS/CFT context
stems from the fact that
the Virasoro generators of the boundary Conformal
Field Theory (CFT) can be built exactly
from operators in string theory on an  worldsheet CFT.
This building was done in ,
where it was also shown that an affine algebra in  can be
uplifted to a similar affine algebra in the
boundary, with a different level.
These constructions are particularly
interesting in the supersymmetric case, where an adequate
field content in  allows to enlarge the boundary Virasoro
symmetry to  Superconformal Field Theory (SCFT) algebras 
with various numbers of supersymmetries. 
This was also shown in , where
the model 
was used to construct a small  SCFT algebra
in the boundary theory(For simplicity,
we discuss only the holomorphic sector of the worldsheet and
the two dimensional spacetime CFT.
The full theory also has a right-handed algebra whose structure
depends on the type of string theory considered: IIA, IIB, heterotic, etc.) .

Following that work, several backgrounds were explored
yielding other amounts of  boundary supersymmetry.
The extended () SCFT algebras in two dimension have
been classified in ,
and are  and two types of , small and large.
Their R-symmetries  are affine , ,
 and , respectively, with
levels depending on the Virasoro central charge.
In the  backgrounds studied,
the theory  contains these affine R-symmetries ,
which are then uplifted to the boundary.

 backgrounds yielding  spacetime SCFT were studied in .
For the  case, three different backgrounds  were proposed:
  and   in , and
  in .
Small  was mentioned above.
Finally, for large  SCFT, a model was studied in with   ,
which  is the minimal field content required for
the boundary R-symmetries .


All these constructions  provide
only sufficient  conditions to yield
boundary extended SCFTs. The purpose of this work is
to study the necessary  constraints
imposed on  by the existence of each of the
extended SCFT algebras in the boundary theory.

Our results strengthen the relationship between  boundary
supersymmetry and worldsheet symmetries of the internal CFT .
This is similar to the case of string compactified to Minkowski space,
where long established results show the intimate connection
between spacetime supersymmetry and the symmetries of the compact
sector .
In this work we will use CFT techniques similar to those
in .
This makes the results hold for general CFT backgrounds, not necessarily having
a geometrical picture as target spaces of non-linear -models.

Superstring theory on 
afford boundary SCFT algebras in the NS sector. This
emerges naturally when supercharges are
built from spin fields creating the Ramond sector of the
worldsheet CFT, as for flat space superstrings ,
and is in accord with expectations
from  supergravity analysis.

For  and small and large , we will show that
the sufficient conditions stated in , respectively,
are also necessary.
For  we  find a set of necessary conditions,
which are an
-covariant version of
a sufficient condition given into enlarge the  SCFT, obtained from
backgrounds of the type, to .

The plan of the work is as follows. Sections 2, 3 and 4 deal
with the ,  and  cases, respectively.
In Section 5 we present a short discussion.
Appendix A is devoted to proving some
properties of the R-currents.
In Appendix B, as an illustration, we show
how the results are realized explicitly for
 in the background .

Spacetime  supersymmetry 
In this section we will show that any critical superstring vacuum
of the form  in which
the spacetime theory has (at least)  superconformal supersymmetry
must be of the form proposed in .
Namely, the internal CFT  contains an affine  symmetry,
and in the CFT quotient  the worldsheet superconformal symmetry
is extended to  supersymmetry.

Let us consider the global part of the 
spacetime superalgebra in the NS sector:

 

() 
() 
() 
() 
with , , and all other (anti)commutators vanishing.

The above spacetime operators are given
by contour integrals of dimension-1  local operators on the
worldsheet. We assume that the global part  of the
Virasoro algebra in spacetime along with the
higher modes  are given
by the construction presented in , so that, 
up to picture-changing,
stvir 

L_0 &=-J^3= - e^- ^3 , L_1  & =-(J^1iJ^2)= -e^-  (^1 i ^2) ,
  

The field  is the bosonized superghost and the
superfields , , are the affine currents of a
supersymmetric   WZW model at level . Their OPEs
are(Indices that go from 1 to 3 will be indicated with
capital letters . For those going from 0 to 3 later we will
use lower case letters .) :

opeads 
J^A(z) J^B(w) &
k2  ^AB  (z-w)^2  + i^ABC

z-w  ,^A(z) ^B(w) & k2 ^AB  z-w  ,  
where  and .
As usual in supersymmetric WZW models,
we can define the currents
bosoniccurrent 
j^A=J^A + i k  ^ABC _BD _CE ^D ^E  ,
 
which form an  affine algebra at level  and have regular
OPE with the free fermions .
The central charge of the  sector is ,
so for a critical theory,  must
have .

  is the zero mode of
the U(1) R-current of the  algebra in spacetime. The higher modes
 can be obtained, say, from the commutators of  with ,
once the latter are introduced.
Alternatively, they can be obtained by the
procedure described in  to uplift an affine current from
the worldsheet to the boundary spacetime theory (see below).

Let  be the worldsheet supercurrent
corresponding to ; we have, up to picture-changing,
stul R_0= 2k J^0= 2k e^-  ^0 , 
where  and  are orthogonal and canonically normalized
(see Appendix A):
jj 

J^0(z) J^0(w) & 1 (z-w)^2  , ^0(z) ^0(w) & 1z-w  ,J^0(z)^0(w) & 0 .
  
To see that the choice  leads to the normalization of , recall
 that the higher modes of the R-current have the form
rmodos 
R_n= a J^0 ^n ,
 
and they satisfy
conmumodosu1 
=a^2pm_n+m,0  ,
  with pdef  p=_z   ,  
where  is the zero-dimension field of the
 pair appearing in the Wakimoto free-field representation
of the algebra . We want to show that . Indeed,
consistency of the  algebrain spacetime implies , where  is the
central charge of the Virasoro algebra in the dual boundary CFT,
given by  . (The reader is
referred to for details of the construction.) 
This fixes . (In the
following we will consider only the expressions for
, but everything holds for the other choice,
changing signs appropriately.) .

As for the relation between this  current and the three
 currents, in Appendix A we  show that the commutation relations in
spacetime  -  and the fact that the worldsheet theory is
supersymmetric force  to lie entirely 
in the internal CFT .

Properties of the spacetime supercharges 
Regarding the four spacetime supercharges  ,
we will only assume that,
as for superstrings in flat space , they are obtained
from operators that create the worldsheet Ramond sector:
gese 
Q^_r=b^ _re^-2  S^_r ,r=12 , 
where  are spin fields and  are constants.
Since unbroken worldsheet supersymmetry requires 
on the Ramond ground state, we have
. This is compatible with the on-shell
condition  for the 's in .
In the presence of spin fields,
the fermionic parts of the superfields become double-valued, i.e.,
integer modded on the plane, and
the bosonic fields remain single-valued.






In our case, we have identified four free fermions , ,
which are the lower components of superfields.
Since, at the moment, we are not given further data on the field content
of the worldsheet theory ,
we only know that the whole set of spin fields is in a representation
of the algebra satisfied by the zero modes of .
This is the four dimensional Clifford algebra:
cliff 
  ^i_0,^j_0  = g^ij k^i  ,
 
with ,  and . In particular,
we can decompose the whole set of spin fields
into irreducible representations (irreps) of .
By a result proved in ,
all the irreps of  have dimension 4 and are all equivalent.
Hence the OPE of the spin fields with the four fermions is
:
propuno 
^i(z)S__1,_2, (w) 
(^i_0)^_1,_2 
S_(z-w)^12    ,  
where  is an index indicating to which
particular irrep we refer, and .
The spacetime algebra  -  implies that
 in  form such an irrep
(this will be described explicitely below).

By Wick rotating , these irreps realize
(anti)spinorial representations of the level-2   affine
algebra constructed out of bilinears of . Since the
 currents are bosonic dimension-1 fields, their OPEs with
the spin fields are single-valued. For such (anti)spinorial
representations of , the weights are .
Choosing for the Cartan subalgebra the fields
haches 
H_1 = 2k ^1 ^2 , H_2  = -i2k  ^0 ^3 ,  
with
hachehache  H_I(z)H_J(w) - _IJ  (z-w) , I,J=1,2 ,  
and , , we must have
aut  iH_1,2 (z) S__1,_2, (w) _1,2   S__1,_2, (w) z-w  , _1,2 =  .  
It follows that the  fields
 can be written as
ese 
S__1,_2, = e^i _1 H_1+ i_2  H_2  e^i _2
N_1     _  ,  
where we have written explicitly the
cocycle , which is
necessary for  to yield a good representation of .
The number operator  is given by
numberop  N_1 =i H_1(z) .  

Equations - imply that
hachesigma 
H_I(z) _ (w) 0 ,
 
and from this we have in turn(
For example, 

, and so on.) 
nhr 
^i(z) _ (w)  0  . 

For future reference we remind that

Note that in  we have obtained for 
the structure usually assumed, with
 generally being a spin field for the other fermionic
fields present in the theory. But the path we have taken is meant to stress
that relations ,  and 
hold under the general property of  being
a representation of the algebra of the four fermions ,
regardless of the further structure of the  CFT.


According to ,
the charge of 
 under  is . Since 
and  have charges  and  under ,
respectively, we conclude that the identification 
should be made, and that  is uncharged under
. This is consistent with the action of  (),
which lowers (raises) the eigenvalue of  by one, provided
that  is untouched by . It follows
that(An  charge of  for 
could also have been obtained by choosing  and letting
 carry charge  under , but this
option is inconsistent with the action of .) 
slsigma  J^A(z)  _ (w) 0 .  

Having identified the -charge of  as
, we expect  to be obtained from
. Imposing  that the supercharges  of
 satisfy  , along with
, fixes(We omit the cocycles from
now on.) 
defmas  S^_r =e^-i r(H_1 H_2)  ^,     r=12 ,   where we
have relabelled  accordingly. Consistency of
the algebra  -  requires
consis    ^+(z)
 ^-(w)  & 1 (z-w)^3 4  ,  ^ (z)  ^ (w)  & O(w)
(z-w)^3 4  .   
Finally, the constants  in
 are determined to be  up to phases.

According to  and ,  the operators 
are charged under  with charges .
But from  the results of Appendix A,
we know that the operators 
 are neutral under , so the charges are in
.
Writing jzeta  J_0=i Y,  with
nory Y(z)Y(w) -(z-w) , 
we must have
sepa 
 ^e^i12k  Y ^ , 
and
ynsi 
Y(z)^(w) 0  . 

Collecting our results until now, we have
colect 
S^_r= e^-ir(H_1 H_2) e^i 12k  Y 
^ ,  
and from ,  and  it follows that
 belong entirely to , i.e.,
opejfi 
J^i(z) ^(w) ^i(z) ^(w) 0 .  
Moreover,
defbeta  (^) ^2 2 =3 8  - 1 4k  = c_/U(1)  24  ,  
as should
be for operators that create the Ramond sector ground state
of  with unbroken supersymmetry.

After the introduction of the 
factors in , eq.  turns into
opesigma 
 ^-(z) ^+(w) & 1 (z-w)^^2   , ^(z) ^(w)
& (z-w)^^2   O^(w) ,
  
where .
We can now use standard techniques.
Consider the four-point function
fourpoint 

f(z_j)= ^-(z_1) ^+(z_2) ^-(z_3)
^+(z_4)  .
 
Using  and  invariance, it can be written as
fpd 
f(z_j)= ( z_13 z_24  z_12 z_34 z_14 z_23  
)^^2  f (x) ,
 
where  and 
. As the points  
coincide pairwise, the OPEs 
imply that  is an analytic function and is bounded
for , hence it is a constant.
Expanding as ,  becomes
fpdl 
f(z_j)=z_12 ^-^2  z_34 ^-^2  ( 1 + ^2
z_12 z_43  z_23 z_24   )  ,
 
where the first term and  fix  to .
The presence of a second term in  implies that in the
 OPE expansion there is a dimension- field
,
opesigmados 
^-(z_1)^+(z_2)  1 z_12 ^^2  
[ 1 + z_12 M(z_2)2  ] ,
 
whose three-point function with  is determined
from  to be
threepoint 
M(z_2) ^-(z_3) ^+(z_4) = 2 ^2
z_34 ^1-^2 z_23 ^-1 z_24 ^-1  .
 
Taking the limits , we obtain
normaeme  M(z)M(w)
4 ^2 (z-w)^2  ,  
and
jota  M(z)^(w)
2 ^2 ^z-w   .  
Defining(The sign choice in  is arbitrary.) 
zeta M 2 iZ , 
with
zetazeta Z(z)Z(w) -(z-w) , 
we have
sigmazetapi ^= e^i Z  ^, 
with
zetapi Z(z)^(w) 0. 
But since 
, it follows that , hence .
Summing up, the spin fields have the form
spinfield 
S^_r= e^-ir(H_1 H_2) e^i 12k  Y  e^i Z  . 

Worldsheet symmetries 
Since the spacetime theory is supersymmetric, 
the supercharges  take physical states
into physical states, hence they should commute with the BRST operator.
This means that in the OPEs between the worldsheet supercurrent  and
 no
 terms appear. The supercurrent is given by
getotal 
G=G_AdS_3  + G_U(1)  + G_/U(1)  , 
where
gterm 

G_AdS_3  & = 2k(^Aj_A+ 2i k ^1^2^3) ,G_U(1)  & = J^0^0 ,
  
and by definition
bydef 
J^iG_/U(1)  ^iG_/U(1)  0 . 

In the computation of the OPEs between   and ,
eqs.  and  imply that singular terms come only from
relev 
( G_AdS_3  + G_U(1) )(z)
e^-ir(H_1 H_2) e^i12k  Y (w) ,
 
and
relevdos 
G_/U(1) (z)e^(i Z) (w) .
 
In the OPEs  two  terms appear which
cancel each other. For the computation it is convenient to express
(see , )
conviene 
4i k^2  ^1^2^3 & =
i k   H_1 (e^-iH_2 -e^iH_2 ),J^0^0 & = 12   J^0 (e^-iH_2 +e^iH_2 ) .
  
Now, given the  current  in ,
every operator  in the theory can be decomposed into terms
with definite -charge  as
pdec 
:e^iq 2  Z P_q(M): _q ,
 

where  is a polynomial in  and its derivatives,
and .

The absence of  terms in
 and dimensional analysis imply that the only
terms allowed when expressing  as  are
gsd 

G_/U(1)  & = G_/U(1) ^+ + G_/U(1) ^-  ,G_/U(1) ^  & = ^  e^ i 2  Z  ,
  
with
susydos 

M(z)G_/U(1) ^ (w) & G_/U(1) ^ (w) z-w  ,
Z(z) ^(w) & 0 .
  
From this it follows  that  has  supersymmetry,
with  being the  R-current . The rest of the  commutators
can be obtained as in , using Jacobi identities.
Note from  and  that 
has the correct normalization for
the  algebra, namely, .


Spacetime  supersymmetry 

Let us consider now the case of spacetime  supersymmetry
in the NS sector. The global subalgebra is 
where ,  and ,
and all other (anti)commutators vanish.
All these spacetime operators are again obtained by contour
integrals of dimension-1  local fields on the worldsheet.
The three operators  are given again
by -.

The three operators  are the zero modes of the 
R-current of the  algebra in spacetime.
Let  be the three dimension- worldsheet
supercurrents corresponding to ; we have, up to picture-changing,
stsutwo T^a_0=  K^a=  e^-  ^a . 

The supercurrents  form an affine  
superalgebra in ,
which is uplifted to an affine  algebra in the dual boundary CFT,
according to the construction of.
The worldsheet level  of this  affine algebra
is again fixed by looking at the higher modes of
the spacetime  affine currents, which are given by
su2modos 
T^a_n=  K^a ^n ,
 
and which satisfy
cmsu2 
[T^a_m,T^b_n]= i^ab _  c T^c_m+n  +
k_st  2  m_a,b _n+m,0  ,
 
where the spacetime  level is ,
with  given by .
Consistency of the  algebra (see) 
in spacetime implies
, which is equivalent to ,
and hence .
Note that the level-dependent normalization of the 
is the same as that
of the  operator in the  case (see eq. ).
We will use these facts below.

We shall also use the purely bosonic -model 
and purely fermionic contributions to the total currents:
boscurdos 
k^a & =  K^a - k^a_su(2)_2  , k^a_su(2)_2 & =- i 4k  ^a _ bc ^b ^c .
  
The currents  and  are two commuting affine  
currents, at levels  and , respectively, 
and the bosonic  commute with the fermions .

Properties of the spacetime supercharges 
Again, the supercharges are given by
gese2 
Q^a_r=b^a _re^-2  S^a_r ,r=12 . 

In the Ramond sector, the algebra of the fermionic zero modes is
now
cliffdos 
 ^A_0,^B_0  & = ^AB k/2  ,
 ^a_0,^b_0  & = ^a,b 2k  ,
 ^A_0,^a_0  & =0 .
  
For the  affine algebra obtained by Wick rotating , we choose
the Cartan subalgebra given by
hachesdos 
H_1  = 2k ^1 ^2 , H_2  = -i k ^3 ^3 , H_3  = 12k  ^1 ^2 ,
 

with
hachehachedos  H_I(z)H_J(w) - _IJ  (z-w),I,J=1,2,3 ,  
and , .

As in the  case, there is a basis for the spin fields
of the form
esedos 
S__1,_2,_3,  =
e^i _1 H_1+ i_2  (H_2 + N_1)+
i_3 (H_3+ N_2+ N_1)  _  ,
 
with
nhrdos 
^A(z)_ (w)  0 , ^a(z)_ (w)  0 , 
and
numberopdos 
N_1,2  =iH_1,2 (z) .
 

The fields  provide a representation of  (as in ),
with any other representation given by a linear change of basis of the spin
fields. For future
reference we remind that
1.6 
  
and from , we have
bosfer 
k^3_su(2)_2  & = -i H_3 , k^ _su(2)_2  & = k^1_su(2)_2  i k^2_su(2)_2  = 
(e^-i H_2  + e^+i H_2  )  e^i H_3   .
  

Now, the algebra () - () has three
 subalgebras, given by, say,
enedos 
Q^ _r & = 12  (Q_r^1 i Q_r^2),R_0 & = T_0^3 .
  
The other two  subalgebras are obtained
by cyclic permutations.
From the result of the previous section we know that for the
representation (), the spin fields
corresponding to the supercharges  in  must
be those obtained from identifying  and
 in , and that
jotalam 
J^A(z)_ (w) 0 .
 

The operators   of ,
having charge  under  and
satisfying ,
must be obtained from
.
Since

has charge  under ,
the other   charge
must be carried by(The possibility that 
carries charge  and  carries charge 
must be discarded because it is inconsistent with the action of .) 
.
We conclude that
there are two fields ,
which from  are charged under  (see ) as
cargalambda 
k^3(z) ^  (w) ^ (w) z-w  ,
 
and that we should make the following identification
(we omit the cocycles from now on):
iden 
 ^  = e^i 2 H_3 ^ .
 
Then from  we obtain
opelambda 

^+(z) ^-(w)  & 1 (z-w)^12   , ^ (z) ^ (w)  & O(w) (z-w)^12  .
   
A similar analysis to the one following , shows
that in the first OPE 
there exists a dimension-1 field :
opelcom 
^+(z) ^-(w)   1 (z-w)^12  
[1 - (z-w)i X^3(w) 2   ] ,
 
with
equistres X^3(z)X^3(w) -(z-w) , 
such that
lambdaequis 
^ = e^i 2  X^3  .
 
 From  and  we find the three-point function
trespuntos 
k^3(z_1) ^+(z_2) ^-(z_3) =
z_12 ^-1  z_13 ^-1  z_23 ^  ,
 
and taking , from  we have
cargaequis 
k^3(z) i X^3(w) - 1 2   (z-w)^2  .
 
The above expression allows to write  as (see )
separoequis 
K^3 & =  k ^3 +k^3_su(2)_1  +k^3_su(2)_2   ,K^  & = K^1 i K^2 = k ^  +
k^ _su(2)_1  + k^ _su(2)_2  ,
  
where
jsuone k^3_su(2)_1 -i2  X^3 , k^ _su(2)_1 k^1_su(2)_1 ik^2_su(2)_1 =e^i2 X^3  . 
Note that the  currents  are decomposed
into three affine  currents ,
 and , with levels
,  and , respectively. 
The  is the theory of a single compact scalar , and the 
 is the theory of three free fermions whose currents are given in 
, .
The three sets of  currents commute among themselves because
katecho 
k ^a(z) ^b(w) k ^a(z) X^3(w)
X^3(z) ^a(w) 0 .
 

Summing up, from  and  we find that the spin fields
corresponding to the supercharges in  are
 
S^ _r = e^-ir (H_1H_2) i2  H_3  
e^i 2  X^3  ,
 
and using the decomposition ,
the operators  can now be obtained by applying 
to . Defining
defin 
S_[,,,] =
e^i 2 ( H_1  H_2   H_3) i 2  X^3 ,
 
the whole algebra is then generated by the following spin fields:
1.6 
  
() 
Note that the  fields provide
(several) spin- representations of the  algebra
of the .
The fields 
in  are in turn two primaries of a spin-
representation of the  made out of .
The spin- representation
 emerges then as the symmetric part of the
 product of these two
spin- representations.






















Worldsheet symmetries 

Let us explore now  the consequences induced by the structure of the spin
fields on the properties of the worldsheet theory.
The BRST condition again implies that no
 singularities appear in the OPEs between 
and the spin fields . The worldsheet supercurrent  is
getotaldos  G  = G_AdS_3  + G_SU(2)  + G_/SU(2) ,  
with  given by  and
gesudos  G_SU(2) =
12k  (^a k_a - i2k ^1 ^2 ^3) .   
The terms whose OPE with
the spin fields might give a  singularity can be
written as
tresmedios   G= & +
i k   H_1 ( e^-iH_2  - e^+iH_2  )  +
12k   ( e^-i 2  + iH_3  + e^-i 2  +
iH_3  )  & -12k  ( i 2   X^3 + iH_3 )
(e^-iH_2  + e^+iH_2 ) + G_/SU(2)  ,
  
where the "dots" stand for terms that manifestly do not contribute
 singularities.
It can be checked that all the 
terms in the OPEs cancel among themselves
for the first three terms in . We find then that
in the OPE between 
and  the highest singularity must be(Note that
from this fact we cannot deduce, as in Section 2.2,
the existence of an  structure
in , with R-current .) 
.

This result will be used in the next subsection.


The identification , which can be stated more explicitly as

e^i 12k  Y iZ =
e^i 2 H_3 i 2  X^3  ,
 
has some consequences. From , ,  and  we have
katres 
K^3=i2k Y .
 
Let  be the  R-current of the worldsheet  structure
obtained in the quotient , where the  is generated by
the supercurrent . We have
emetres 
M^3=2iZ ,
 
where  and  are defined in , , .
Equating the exponents in 
and using  and  it follows that
idencor 
M^3 = -1k K^3 + k^3_su(2)_2  + 2 k^3_su(2)_1  .
 
It was shown in  that
if  contains a supersymmetric  affine symmetry
and has the properties required to yield spacetime  supersymmetry,
then a sufficient  condition to extend spacetime supersymmetry
to  is that  contains a dimension-1 field 
,
which commutes with , and such that  holds.
Here we see that the existence of the field  with these properties
is also necessary .

Moreover, eq.  was obtained by looking at the  
subalgebra ,
but it must also hold for the two other  subalgebras of
() - ().
The general relation is then
idencorgen 
M^a = -1k K^a + k^a_su(2)_2  + 2 k^a_su(2)_1  ,
 
where  is the  R-current of the  structure
obtained in the quotient  (with the  generated by
), and 
were defined in  and .
Of course, for , in order to obtain  explicitly
in the same way  was obtained from , different
basis for the spin fields must be chosen.

An important consequence of  is that
emerota 
K^a(z)M^b(w) & i^ab _  c M^c(w) z-w  ,
M^d(z)^e(w) & (1 - 1k )   i ^de _  f 
^f z-w   .
  

Summing up, we have seen that the existence of  superconformal symmetry
in the two dimensional theory dual to  implies that:
 
 contains an affine  symmetry at level .
In the quotient of  by each one of the three  supercurrents
,
the worldsheet supersymmetry is extended to ,
and the corresponding three  R-currents  satisfy .

Moreover, it is easy to see that these two conditions are also
sufficient  to
yield  spacetime supersymmetry, and are equivalent
to the conditions formulated in .

Note that the fact that the  currents  rotate the
three  R-currents  implies that the  part
is embedded in  as a nontrivial fibration over .
Namely, if  is a direct product -
 - then  commute with the
contributions to  coming from , and thus cannot satisfy
.
The only exception to this is when  is trivial, namely,
. This holds for  , and the conditions
 are indeed satisfied in this case.
This is a special case of a series of solutions
, because  as
SCFTs.


Spacetime  supersymmetry 
An interesting consequence of the structure found above is that
in every background which allows spacetime  supersymmetry,
there is also a different GSO projection leading to precisely  boundary
supersymmetry(Indeed, this was shown to be the case for the examples
studied in; here we argue that this is general.) .
This algebra is constructed from the singlet of the
 (discussed after eq. ),
and is generated by
1.6 
  
() 

Note that the difference between these two operators and
 in  is that
the sign of  is changed (different GSO projection) and
the relative sign between the terms is now negative for the singlet.
Using the fact that in the OPE between 
and , the highest singularity is 
(see the discussion after eq. ),
the operators  can be checked to be BRST invariant.
Finally, they have regular OPEs with
, as expected for the singlet.


Spacetime small and large  supersymmetry 
The analysis for these two cases is similar, mutatis mutandi, to that
of , and we will only indicate the general arguments.

Small  has an affine  R-symmetry whose level is fixed
to be  (the same as the  level)
by the spacetime algebra. The central charge of  is then
cargatc  c_/ SU(2)_k  =c_ -3(k-2) k  - 32 =6 , 
and the construction of the spin fields leads to the
same supercharges constructed in. As in Section 2,
the BRST condition shows that the worldsheet supersymmetry in
 is extended to , and from  this
actually means that there is a small  supersymmetry in the
worldsheet(A ,  SCFT
has necessarily small .) .
The latter was realized in by means of .

The analysis of the large  case leads necessarily to
 .
The reason is that the spacetime R-symmetry requires the presence
of affine 
in the worldsheet theory, and consistency of the spacetime algebra
requires the levels  of
the two  models to satisfy .
This implies that the

background is critical, and thus the unique one allowing large 
boundary supersymmetry.
This is compatible with the fact that the spin fields generating the Ramond
sector of the 10 free worldsheet fermions already have ,
and hence the spacetime supercurrents must be constructed from them.
This is indeed the construction in.
This model was also studied in
,.


Discussion 
In this work the necessary conditions have been
found for the internal CFT , imposed by the existence of 
SCFT in the boundary dual of string theory on . 
Our results are summarized in Table 1.

[h]
  

This summarizes the necessary conditions on the internal CFT  
imposed by different extended supersymmetries in the dual boundary CFT. 
All the conditions are also sufficient.
In the  case,  is obtained for the other GSO projection;
 are the generators of , and  denotes the 
 quotient CFT with the  generated by the superfield 
.
In small ,
 is a  unitary CFT with a small  superconformal  symmetry. 
 

The case of precisely   supersymmetry in the boundary 
two dimensional CFT seems to be non-trivial.
Of course, it can be realized
as a byproduct of theories having higher
amounts of boundary supersymmetries. Examples of this
are the other GSO projection of theories
with boundary  (see Section 3.3), 
or a particular  orbifold of theories with  .
But, to our knowledge, no example is known where the theory 
 does not involve "too rich" a structure.
The latter typically takes care of the BRST invariance
of the spacetime supercharges, by compensating for the  term
coming from the  part. 
Hence, the requirement is for the minimal structure
needed in  to compensate this term while still closing just an  
spacetime superconformal algebra.

Finally, general properties of the spectrum of superstrings in 
, with extended supersymmetry, can be studied along 
the lines of.

Properties of the affine currents 

In this appendix we shall prove three
properties of the affine currents which we have used throughout the paper.
Let  be a generic worldsheet supercurrent
corresponding to the affine symmetries uplifted to the boundary theory, then
it holds for  and  that:
 
They are orthogonal.
They have the same normalization.
They commute with the three  currents,
so they lie entirely in .



Given the worldsheet supercurrent ,
remember that for any dimension-
superfield , we have
opegmodos 

[G_s,K_m] & = -m _s+m , G_s,_n & = K_s+n .
  
Property  can be seen by
considering  the Jacobi identity
supjacobi 

G_s,[_t,K_q]-_t,[K_q,G_s]+[K_q,G_s,_t] & =0 , G_s,[_t,K_q]-q_t,_q+s +[K_q,K_s+t ] & =0 , G_s,[_t,K_q] -q_t+q+s,0  + q_t+q+s,0  & =0 ,
  
for every set of , and  it follows that
jpzero 
 K(z) (w) 0 .
 
Property 2 follows from
mismanorma 

G_-m-n ,[_n,K_m]-
_n,[K_m,G_-m-n ]+[K_m,G_-m-n ,_n] & =0 , 0 -m_n,_-n + [K_m,K_-m ]&=0 ,
  
for every ,.

As for Property 3,
the commutators , where  are given in
 and ,
show that there are no simple poles in the OPEs between  and .
A possible double pole is forbidden by Jacobi identities such as
jacobijotas 

[K_n,[J^A_-n+1 ,J^B_-1 ]] +
[J^A_-n+1 ,[J^B_-1 ,K_n]] + [J^B_-1 ,[K_n,J^A_-n+1 ]] & = 0  , ^ABC _CD [K_n,J^D_-n ]+ 0 + 0  & = 0 ,
  
and from this  we find that
opecero 
J^A(z)K(w) 0 .
 
Consider now the Jacobi identity,
jacobi 

[G_s,[J^A_m,K_n]] + [J^A_m,[K_n,G_s]] + [K_n,[G_s,J^A_m]] & = 0 , 0 + n[J^A_m,_n+s ]  -m [K_n,^A_m+s ]] & = 0 ,
  
where the first term is zero because of .
Choosing  or  in , we have then
ges 
[K_0,^A_t]  = [J^A_0,_t] = 0 ,
 
for every . On the other hand, in the OPE, say,
between  and , the only terms that can
appear are
opejf 
K(z)^A(w) (w) z-w  ,
 
with , but from ,
chicero 
(w)= [K_0, ^A(w)] = 0 .
 
In the same way we see that
opecerom 

J^A(z)(w) &0 , ^A(z)K(w) & 0 .
  

Consider finally  Jacobi identities such as superjacobi 

G_-n+1 ,[_n,J^A_-1 ]-_n,[J^A_-1 ,G_-n+1 ]
+[J^A_-1 ,G_-n+1 ,_n] & =0 , 0 +_n,^A_-n + [J^A_-1 ,K_1]&=0 , 0
+_n,^A_-n  + 0 &=0 ,   
where we have used 
and . We conclude then that
opecerof 
^A(z)(w) 0 ,   and it follows from ,
 and  that  commutes with
the  sector of the worldsheet, and hence it lies entirely
in .


Realization of the symmetries for  
In  it was shown that eq.  holds in case
 and .
These backgrounds, as shown there explicitly,
yield spacetime  (or ) supersymmetry.

In this appendix we will illustrate our results by seeing how the
geometric structure obtained in Section 3.2 is explicitly realized
in another background which was also shown to have  spacetime
supersymmetry.

The background is 
, and was studied in , where the
explicit form of the spin fields is given. The two supersymmetric
 WZW models have level . Let 
 be the  currents and 
 be the affine  current. The  orbifold acts as
accionorbifold 

(K^a_1,K^a_2,Y) & (K^a_2,K^a_1,-Y) , (^a_1, ^a_2, ) & (^a_2, ^a_1, -) .
  
Define sumaresta   K^a_+ & =
K^a_1 + K^a_2 ^a_+ = ^a_1 + ^a_2  , K^a_- & = K^a_1 - K^a_2 ^a_- = ^a_1 - ^a_2 .
  

The currents  form a supersymmetric  WZW model at level  which survives the
orbifold and is uplifted to the  affine R-current of the  superconformal algebra in spacetime.

The supercurrent  is
superjapo 
G_ = 1k(^a_1 k_1a  - i k ^1_1 ^2_1 ^3_1)
+ 1k(^a_2 k_2a  - i k ^1_2 ^2_2 ^3_2)
+ iY .
 
Each superfield  
constitutes a supersymmetric  affine model with supercurrent
superunojapo 
G_U^a(1) = 12k  ^a_+ K^a_+ .
 
The coset of  by each of these 
currents gives a theory whose supercurrent can be written as
supercosetjapo 

G_/U^3(1) =G_ -G_U^3(1) = & 12k _+^1k_+^1 +
12k _+^2k_+^2 +
& + 12k _-^1k_-^1
+ 12k _-^2k_-^2 + 12k _-^3 K_-^3
 + iY ,
   with the  cases given by cyclic permutations. For each
  there is an   structure which survives the orbifold,
whose  R-current  is
errejapo   M^a= -1k K^a_+ -
i 4k ^a _ bc ^b_+ ^c_+ -
i 4k ^a _ bc ^b_- ^c_- -
i 2k  ^a_-  ,  
and from  we can
identify idenequis 2k^a_su(2)_1   =
-i 4k ^a _ bc ^b_- ^c_- 
-i 2k  ^a_-  .  
The currents 
clearly satisfy
emerotajapo  K^a_+(z)M^b(w) & i^ab _  c M^c(w) z-w  , M^d(z)_+^e(w) & (1 -
1k )   i ^de _  f  _+^f z-w   ,    as expected from
.
