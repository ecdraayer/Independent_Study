  We give an introduction to a 
  new approach to the covariant quantization of superstrings. 
  After a brief review of the classical Green-Schwarz 
  superstring and Berkovits' approach to its quantization based on 
  pure spinors, we discuss our covariant formulation without pure spinor 
  constraints. We discuss the relation between the concept of grading, 
  which we introduced to define vertex operators, and 
  homological perturbation theory, and we compare our work with recent 
  work by others. In the appendices, 
  we include some background material for the Green-Schwarz and 
  Berkovits formulations, in order that this presentation be self 
  contained. 
 
 


 
 
 
 

 

 
 
Introduction  
String theory is mostly based on the Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz (RNS) 
formulation, with worldsheet fermions  in the vector 
representation of the spacetime Lorentz group . This 
formulation exhibits classically a  local supersymmetry of the 
worldsheet.  The BRST symmetry of the RNS formulation is based on the 
super-reparametrization invariance of the worldsheet. The fundamental 
fields are the bosons , the fermions , the 
reparametrization ghosts  and the superghosts 
. Physical states correspond to vertex operators which i)  belong 
to the BRST cohomology and ii)  are annihilated by the zero mode  of the 
antighost for the open string, or by  and  for the closed string.  To obtain 
a set of physical states which form a representation of spacetime 
supersymmetry, the GSO projection is applied to remove half of the 
physical states. Spacetime supersymmetry is thus not manifest, and the 
study of Ramond-Ramond backgrounds is not feasible. Therefore, one 
would prefer a formulation with spacetime fermions  belonging 
to a representation of  because it would keep spacetime 
supersymmetry (susy) manifest. 

At the classical level, such a 
formulation was constructed by Green and Schwarz in 1984 
. Their classical action contains two fermions 
 () and the bosonic coordinates . Each of the 
's is real and can be chiral or anti-chiral (type IIA/B 
superstrings): they are -component Majorana-Weyl spinors which are 
spacetime spinors and worldsheet scalars. We denote chiral 
spinors by contravariant indices  with ; 
antichiral spinors are denoted by , also with . 
We shall only consider chiral 's below.  

The rigid spacetime supersymmetry is given by the usual non-linear 
coordinate representation 
susyA _^i  = ^i ,       
_x^m = ^i ^m ^i = i ^i   ^m_  ^i  ,  
where  are  ten real symmetric  matrices and the 
flavor indices  are summed over. (In appendix A, Dirac matrices and 
Majorana-Weyl spinors are reviewed). 
Susy-invariant building blocks are 
susyB ^m__x^m - 
i ^i ^m _^i,       _^i   where  
and  and . A natural choice for the action 
on a flat background spacetime and curved worldsheet would seem to be 
susyC L _1 = -1  2     -h   
h^  _mn   ^m_^n_,   
with  the worldsheet metric, 
because it is the susy-invariant line element (a natural generalization of the 
action for the bosonic string). However, it yields no kinetic term for the fermions. Even if 
one could produce a kinetic term, there would still be the problem that one would have 
 fermionic propagating modes and  bosonic 
propagating modes. Such a theory could not yield a linear representation of supersymmetry. 
 
A resolution of this problem became possible when Siegel found a new 
local fermionic symmetry (-symmetry) for the point particle 

. 
Green and Schwarz tried to find this symmetry in their string, and they discovered 
that it is present, but only after adding a Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten 
term to the action. Using this symmetry one could impose the gauge 
 (where ), and if 
one then also fixed the local scale and general coordinate symmetry by 
, and the remaining conformal symmetry by 
, the action became a free string theory with  
fermionic degrees of freedom and  bosonic degrees of freedom. Susy 
was linearly realized and quantization posed no problem. 
 
However, in this combined -light cone gauge, manifest  
Lorentz invariance is lost, and with it all the reasons for studying the 
superstring in the first place. (We shall call the string of 
Green and Schwarz the superstring, to distinguish it from the RNS 
string which we call the spinning string.) 
 
Going back to the original classical action, it was soon 
realized that second class constraints were present, due to the 
definition of the conjugate momenta of the 's. These second class 
constraints could be handled by decomposing them w.r.t. a non-compact 
 subgroup of  (see appendix D) , but then again 
manifest Lorentz invariance was lost. An approach to quantization 
which could deal with second class constraints and keep covariance 
was needed. By using a 
proposal of Faddeev and Fradkin, one could 
turn second class constraints into first class constraints by adding further fields, 
but upon quantization one now obtained an infinite set of ghosts-for-ghosts, and 
problems with the calculation of anomalies were encountered. At the end 
of the 80's, several authors tried different approaches, but they always 
encountered infinite sets of ghosts-for-ghosts, and 15 years of pain 
followed . 
 
A few years ago Berkovits developed a new line of thought . 
Taking a flat background and a flat worldsheet metric, 
the central charge  in one sector(One  is always left-moving and the other  is 
always right-moving, whether or not they have the same chirality.)  
of 10 free bosons  and one  is 
 
(there is a conjugate momentum  for ). He noted 
that if one decomposes a chiral spinor  under the 
non-compact  subgroup of , it decomposes as 

 (see Appendix D). 
Imposing the constraint 
pure ^T ^m l= 0,  
also known as pure spinor constraint , 
one can express the  in terms of the  
and , and hence it seemed that by adding a commuting 
pure spinor (with conjugate momenta for the  
and ), one could obtain vanishing central charge: 
. In 
the past few years, he has developed this approach further. 
 
Having a constraint such as () in a theory 
leads to problems at the quantum level in the computation of loop 
corrections and in the definition of the path integral. A similar situation 
occurred in superspace formulations of supergravity, where one must impose constraints 
on the supertorsions; in that case the constraints were solved and the 
covariance was sacrificed. One could work only with  and 
, but then one would again violate manifest Lorentz 
invariance. 
 
We have developed an approach 
 which starts with the same 
 
and  as used by Berkovits, but we relax the constraint () by 
adding new ghosts. In Berkovits' and our approach one has the BRST 
law , with real , but in Berkovits' approach  
must be complex in order that () have a solution at all, 
whereas in our approach  is real . 
The law  is an enormous simplification over the law one would 
obtain from the -symmetry law  
with selfdual . It is this simpler starting point that avoids the 
infinite set of ghosts-for-ghosts. Perhaps our finite set of fields corresponds to 
resummations of the infinite set of fields 
encountered in previous approaches. 
First, we give a brief review of the classical superstring action from which 
we shall only extract a set of first class constraints . These first 
class constraints are removed from the action and used to construct a BRST charge. 
 
We deduce the full theory 
by requiring nilpotency of the BRST charge: each time nilpotency on a given field 
does not hold we add a new field (ghost) and define its BRST transformation 
rule such that nilpotency holds.  A priori, one might expect that one would end up again with an 
infinite set of ghosts-for-ghosts, but to our happy surprise the iteration procedure 
stops after a finite number of steps. 
 
In some modern approaches the difference between the action and the BRST charge becomes 
less clear (in the BV formalism the action is even equal to the BRST charge, and 
in string field theory the action is expressed in terms of the BRST charge). So the 
transplantation of the first class constraints from the action to the BRST charge may not be as 
drastic as it may sound at first. We may in this way create a different off-shell formulation of the 
same physical theory. The great advantage of this procedure is that one is left with a free 
action, so that propagators become very easy to write down, and OPE's among vertex operators 
become as easy as in the RNS approach. 
 
We shall now present our approach. We have a new definition of physical states, 
and we obtain the correct spectrum for the open string as well as for the closed 
superstring, both at the massless level and at the massive levels. Since these 
notes are intended as introduction to our work, we give much background material 
in the appendices. Such material is not present in our papers, but 
may help to understand the reasons and the technical aspects of our approach. 
Our approach differs from the conventional approaches to the BRST quantization of strings. 
One would therefore like to see it work in a simpler example. For that reason we have applied 
our ideas to pure Yang-Mills field theory . One gets also in that case the 
correct cohomology. 

We have found since the conference some deep geometrical meanings of the new ghosts, but we have 
not yet found the underlying classical action to which our quantum theory corresponds. Sorokin, Tonin and 
collaborators have recently shown  how one can obtain Berkovits' theory 
from a  worldsheet action with superdiffeomorphism embeddings, and it is possible 
that a similar approach yields our theory. 
 
The classical Green-Schwarz action  
 
As we already mentioned, a natural generalization of the bosonic string with  with 
spacetime supersymmetry is the supersymmetric line element given in  and . 
If one considers the interaction term  and if 
one chooses the light cone gauge  one obtains a term 
. This is not a satisfactory 
kinetic term because we also would need a term with . Such a term 
would be obtained if the action contains a term of the form , or in covariant 
notation . 
The extra kinetic term   is part of a Wess-Zumino term 
(see appendix B). 
 
Rigid susy  and  
would lead to . This suggests that the light-cone gauge for  
should read , or, in terms of  matrices, . 
If , also , and inserting 
, one would also 
find that  for . So, then we would find in the light cone gauge 
that the action for  becomes a free action, a good starting point for string theory at the 
quantum level. 
 
In order that these steps are correct, we would need a local fermionic symmetry which would justify 
the gauge .  Pursuing this line of thought, one arrives then at the 
crucial question: does the sum of the supersymmetric line element and the WZNW term contain a new fermionic 
symmetry with half as many parameters as there are  components ? The answer is affirmative, and the 
-symmetry is briefly discussed at the end of appendix B, but since we shall not need the explicit form of 
the  symmetry transformation laws, we do not give them. 
 
The superstring action is very complicated already in a flat background. We extract from it a set of 
first class constraints , from which we build the BRST charge, and at all stages we work with a 
free action. 





The precise way to obtain  from the classical superstring action is discussed in appendix C. 
 

 
Determining the theory from  the nilpotency of the BRST charge  
 
We now start our program of determining the theory 
(the BRST charge and the ghost content) by requiring 
nilpotency of the BRST transformations. We consider one  for 
simplicity (we have also extended 
our work to two 's ). 
We shall be careful (for once) with aspects such as reality and normalizations. 
The BRST transformations preserve reality and are generated by  where  
is imaginary and anti-commuting. It then follows that  should also be antihermitian in order that 
 be antihermitian. For any field, we define 
the  transformations as BRST transformations without , 
so  and . 
The -transformations have reality properties 
which follow from the BRST transformations (which preserve reality). 
 
We begin with 
BRSTA Q = i ^d_z ,  
where  is given in Appendix C and 
. This Q is indeed antihermitian because  is 
antihermitian. (We have performed a Wick rotation in appendix C, in order to be able to use the conventional tools 
of conformal field theory, but the reality properties hold in Minkowski space). 
The BRST operator depends on Heisenberg fields which satisfy the field 
equations, and since we work with a free action,  and  so that 
in flat space  is a holomorphic current, namely 
. 


 
The field  contains a term , where  is the 
momentum conjugate to  and it is antihermitian since  
is antihermitian as can be seen from the action . 
The factor  in   in eq.  
can be checked by noting that the OPEThe OPE of  with  is evaluated 
using  and   
of  with  be proportional to . The expression for  is real and fixed by spacetime 
susy. 
 
The operators  generate a closed algebra of currents with a central charge 
BRSTB  
d_(z) d_(w) 2 i ^m_ _m(w) z-w  , 
        
d_(z) ^m(w) - 2 i ^m_ ^(w)  z-w  , 
  



 
 
Acting with  on , one obtains 
, and acting on   yields . Nilpotency 
on  and  is achieved. 
Repeating this procedure on  
gives , but since  
does not vanish, we introduce a new real anticommuting ghost  by setting 
 and choosing the BRST transformation law of 
 such that the nilpotency on  is obtained. This leads to 
. Nilpotency on  is now achieved, but  
has acquired an extra 
termSpacetime susy requires that  depends on  
instead of, for example .  
 where we recall 
. Nilpotency on , or 
equivalently on , is obtained by further 
modifying the sum of 

 and 
 
by adding 


 and fixing the BRST law of  such that nilpotency on 
 is achieved.Since , 
we add a term  instead of a field .  
This yields  
and  due to a Fierz rearrangement involving three 
chiral spinors (see eq. ()). At this point we have achieved nilpotency on 
 and . We introduce the antighosts 
 for the ghosts  and 
find that  with 
BRST  
Q = (i^d_z  -^m _z m  - __z ^
- 2 ^m (_z _m ) -i _z m  ^m ) 
  
reproduces all BRST laws for all fields introduced so far except for 
the three antighosts.
 
Unfortunately, the BRST charge  fails to be nilpotent and 
therefore the concept of BRST cohomology is at this point 
meaningless. In order to repair this problem, we could proceed in two different 
ways: i)  either continuing with our program of requiring nilpotency on each field 
separately (continuing with the antighosts ,  and ); or ii)  
terminate this process by hand in one stroke by adding a ghost 
pair  as we now explain. 
We begin with 
nilA  
Q,Q = A_z ,        A_z = _m _z ^m + i  ^_z _
- i __z ^.  
The non-closure term  is due to the double poles 
in . By direct computation we establish that the anomaly  is 
BRST invariant, as it should be according to consistency, 
 where . 
If we define 
nilB  
Q' = Q + ( c_z - b B_z), 
  
with an hermitian  and an antihermitian , 
we find that 
nilC  Q',Q' = ( (A_z - B_z) +  b [Q,B_z] ),  
and, requiring that  be nilpotent, a solution for  is obtained by 
imposing(The relation  follows from acting with  on .)   
nilD  
[Q,B_z]=0 ,       B_z = A_z + _z X ,      [Q,X] = - Y 
  
which is satisfied by . Then one 
gets(One can even obtain a nilpotent current: . 
Use that Q, but not , commutes with .)   
nilE  
B_z = _m _z ^m + i 2   ^_z _- 3i  2   
__z ^. 
  















 
However, any  of the form "more" can be always  brought in the form 
 by a similarity transformation, 
namely as follows 
newup  
Q' = [ e^(- R_z - b S_z - b _z b T)  c_z 
e^(R_z + b S_z + b _z b T)  
] 
  




 
where . The  and 
 are hermitian polynomials in all fields except  with ghost numbers 
, respectively.  The solution in  and  corresponds to a particular 
choice of  and (Namely, . All the 
terms displayed in () contribute.) , but any other choice also yields a nilpotent BRST 
charge. 

There is now a problem: 
the operator  has trivial 
cohomology in the space of local vertex operators, 
because any  satisfying  can always be written 
as  where . 
(Note that  cannot depend on  because , and ). 
 
We shall restrict 
the space of vertex operators in which  acts, in order to obtain non-trivial 
cohomology. We achieve this by introducing a new quantum number, called grading, 
and requiring that vertex operators have non-negative grading. In the 
smaller space of non-negative grading (see next section) the similarity transformation 
cannot transform each  into the form , and we shall indeed 
obtain non-trivial cohomology, namely the correct cohomology. 

We have at this point obtained a new nilpotent BRST charge, and a set of ghost (and 
antighost) fields (whose geometrical meaning at this point is becoming clear). It is time 
to revert to the issue of the central charge. Since all fields are free 
fields, one simply needs to add the central charge of each canonical pair: this yields  
. So the central charge does not vanish, and to remedy this obstruction, we 
add by hand a real anticommuting vector pair  which contributes 
 to . The BRST charge does not contain  and , 
hence   and  are BRST inert. 
 
The reader (and the authors) may feel uncomfortable with these 
rescue missions by hand; a good theory should produce all fields automatically 
without outside help. Fortunately, we can announce that a more 
fundamental way of proceeding, by  continuing to require 
nilpotency on the antighosts and then on the new fields which are introduced 
 in this process, produces the pair ! We are in the process of writing 
these consideration up, and hopefully also the pair  will be automatically 
produced in this way. 
 
Our results obtained by elementary methods and ad hoc additions, display nevertheless 
a few striking regularities, which confirm us in our belief that we are on the right track. 
For example, the grading which we discuss in the next section is generated by a current whose 
anomaly vanishes. This need not have happened, and provides welcome support 
for the various steps we have taken, but it hints of course at something more fundamental.
 
The notion of the grading  
 
In our work we define physical states by means of vertex operators which 
satisfy two conditions 
 
i)  They are in the BRST cohomology 
 
ii)  They should have non-negative grading . 
 
The grading is a quantum number which was initially obtained from the algebra of the abstract currents 
 and . Assigning grading  to , we assign grading  
to the corresponding ghost . We then require that the grading be preserved in the 
operator product expansion. From  we deduce that  has grading , 
so  has grading . Then  assigns grading  to , and thus grading  
to . (To avoid confusion note that in some of our pubblished work we use half these gradings).
The grading of the ghosts  and  is more subtle, but it can be obtained in the same 
spirit. From  and  we introduce 
a central charge generator  which has grading . The corresponding 
ghost  has grading . All antighosts have opposite grading from the ghosts. The trivial 
ghost pair  has grading  because it is part of a quartet of which the grading 
of the other members is already known . 
With these grading assignments to the ghost fields, the BRST charge can be 
decomposed into terms with definite but different gradings. It turns out that 
all the terms have non-negative grading: . 
This  maps the subspace of the Hilbert space with non-negative grading into itself. In 
, the equivalence with Berkovits' pure spinor formulation has been 
proven. 
 
According to the grading condition ii) , the most general expression for the massless 
vertex in the case of open superstring is given by 
graddA  
O  = ^A_+ ^m A_m + _W^+ 
_m B^m + b-terms  
  
where  and  are arbitrary superfields, so , etc.. 
Requiring non-negative grading, the following combinations 
gradB  
b ^^,         b ^^m, 
  
are not allowed. Note that the vertex operator does not have a specific grading 
but contains terms with several (nonnegative) gradings. 

Finally, requiring BRST invariance of , one easily derives 
the equations of motion for  SYM in . From the -terms in  
one only finds that the superfields in these terms are expressed in terms of  and . 
However, in the sectors with  and  one learns that all remaining superfields 
appearing in this vertex operator can be expressed in terms of , for example
bbbb 
A_m = 1 8  ^m_  D_A_, 
       
W^= 1 10   ^m_  ( D_A_m - _m A_
). 
The superfield  itself satisfies 
bbbc 
^ _[mnrpq]  D_A_= 0,
 
which contains the linearized Dirac and Yang-Mills equations upon expanding 
in terms of . 

Along the 
same lines, one can study the closed string or massive vertex operators and one finds the 
complete correct spectrum of the open or closed superstring. Other interesting cases one 
might study are the superstring in lower dimensions, or a finitely reducible gauge theory. 
 
The notion that one must restrict the space of the vertex operators is not new 
by itself: in the spinning (RNS) string, one should restrict the commuting susy ghosts 
to non-negative mode numbers 
, and also in the bosonic string one has the condition 
that vertex operators are annihilated by  (where  belongs to ). 
We have shown  that the concept of grading is nothing else that 
the "pure ghost number" of homological perturbation theory 
. So there is, after all, a deeper geometrical meaning to the ideas we have developed. 

Grading, reducibility, homological perturbation theory and BRST nilpotency 

In the previous section we have introduced a new quantum number for fields, the grading, 
and a new definition of physical states which required that vertex operators have non-negative 
grading. The results (the correct physical  spectrum) justify to some extent this notion of a grading. 
We now present a new understanding: 
the grading number is the pure ghost number (resolution degree) of homological 
perturbation theory . 

According to homological perturbation theory (HPT) 
, once one has an initial BRST-like symmetry  which 
is nilpotent modulo constraints  and gauge transformations (with 
possibly field dependent parameter  where the gauge transformations 
are due to OPE's of the fields with the constraints), we may introduce new 
fields  and a new 
nilpotent operatorThis operator is known in the literature as the Koszul-Tate 
resolutor.   such that 
resA 
_-1   P _a = - G_a,         _-1  (other fields ) = 0.
 
The new fields  carry a new quantum number usually called 
antifield number and the operator  lowers this number. The solutions of , 
but  are called homology instead cohomology classes because of this lowering. 
Next one relaxes the constraints  and if there is nontrivial homology, 
one introduces a new ghost which removes this spurious homology. 
In our case , and there is a new homology, namely . 
Indeed , but  because only 
 transforms under . Thus we add a ghost  and define 
. Then  becomes trivial 
homology. Now we repeat the argument. There is again a new homological class; 
it is given by . Indeed, 

 and . 
Again, HPT would instruct us to introduce new ghosts  and define 
. This is the conventional path. 
However, we followed another path. Namely, we introduced an antighost  with 
antifield number  and this removes the extra homology class 
 because it is now equal to 
 if at the same time we add a term 
 to . At this point we have a nilpotent  
without any non-trivial homology classes. 

Note that we only introduced  at the level 
of . We could have introduced  one step earlier, namely when we removed 
; in that case we would not have needed a ghost  (which 
is however useful for the central charge) and still we would have obtained a nilpotent  
without any non-trivial homology. However, we could not have introduced  at the very beginning 
when we had the non-trivial homology  , because we would have gotten a trivial spectrum of the BRST 
charge.  

It has been proven that one can always add further operators  to 
 such that  is nilpotent. 
The form of  with  follows from the requirement that . 
The 's have definite antifield number equal to . In addition, 
one can define a further quantum number by a linear combination of the antifield 
number and the ghost number; it turns out that the pure ghost number  , 
defined as the sum of the ghost number  plus the antifield number , coincides 
with our grading number. 

In the superstring case,  should be identified with Berkovits' BRST-like symmetry in ()
which acts on the fields , where  is the conjugate 
momentum of . This  should be nilpotent 
up to the pure spinor constraint  and up to the gauge 
transformations  (the bracket 
 is in our case written in terms of the operator product). Indeed, 
SSb 
Q^2_B x^m = -12  l^m l,      
Q^2_B ^= 0,      
Q^2_B d_= -12  (l^m ) ,      




The field   corresponds in our case to  and 
 corresponds to   
where  is the grading zero part of the 
BRST charge. Further, we identify , 
 and  where  and . 

The fields  have by definition vanishing antifield number. Hence 
 which agrees (up to a factor 2) with our 
grading. Similarly also for all other fields   is equal to twice our grading. 
Hence, our notion of grading is closely related to the notion of antifield number in homological 
perturbation theory. 

There is however, a difference between our approach and standard homological 
perturbation theory. In the latter case one has by definition only fields with 
positive antifield number (contributing to  with ), but in our case we have antighosts 
in the theory, and if the ghosts have positive antifield number, it is reasonable to assign 
the opposite (negative) antifield number to the antighosts (in this way the action is neutral). 
One must introduce a floor from 
which to work upwards, in a similar way as Dirac introduced the concept of 
a sea to excluded unbounded negative energy. We have constructed such a floor by hand, by requiring 
that the vertex operators have a lower bound on their grading; from 
the previous correspondence it even follows that this lower bound is zero. 

We end with some comments on the previous discussion. In any application of HPT one can distinguish 
the following aspects
 
the constraints one starts with may be reducible of irreducible. As constraints, following 
Berkovits, we choose  because we decompose 
 into constraints 
 and generators . Our set of constraints is reducible because there exists 
(field dependent and in general composite) parameters  such that , 
namely . 
One either works at the classical level or at the quantum level. We have been working at the quantum 
level. 
The algebra of first class constraints may contain only first order poles, or also 
second order poles in . We did encounter second order poles, but note that 
they were not due to double contractions, but rather to derivatives of first order poles. 
We deviated from the conventional HPT by introducing the antighost . 
It may be that our pair  has some relation to Jacobians which arise in the 
path integral treatment of WZWN models. 

A more detailed discussion of the relation between Berkovits' formalism, our 
formalism, HPT and equivariant cohomology is in preparation.

Majorana and Weyl spinors in .  
 
In  dimensions, we 
use ten real  Dirac-matrices 
 
where  and . The  are eight real symmetric  
off-diagonal Dirac matrices for , while  is the real 
 diagonal chirality matrix in The 8 real   matrices 
of  can be obtained from a set of 7 purely imaginary  
matrices  for  as follows . The 
seven  matrices  themselves can be obtained from the 
representation , and 
 for,  with real symmetric matrices  and 
imaginary antisymmetric  as follows 



 
 . 
So ,  and . 
The chirality matrix in  is then  and the  
charge conjugation matrix , satisfying 
, is given by . If one uses spinors 
 with spinor indices  and , 
the index structure of the Dirac matrices, the charge conjugation matrix , and the chirality matrix 
 
is as follows 
  

  
 where  and . 
The matrices  and  are 
 numerically equal to  and 
 , respectively. 
Thus the  are chiral and the 
 are antichiral. This explains the spinorial index structure of the . 
 
In applications we need the matrices  (for example in ). Direct 
matrix multiplication shows that  is given by 
  
using 
 
We only use the real  symmetric matrices  
and  in the text, and we omit the dots for 
reasons we now explain. 
 
The Lorentz generators are given by 
  
Hence the chiral spinors  and the antichiral  form separate representation 
for . These representations are inequivalent because  and  are equal 
except for  where  but , and there is no matrix  satisfying 
 and . (From  it follows 
that ). We denote these real inequivalent representation by  
and , respectively. 
 
In  dimensions one cannot raise or lower spinor indices with the charge 
conjugation matrix, because  is off-diagonal. In , on the other hand,  
is diagonal and is given by 







, and therefore one can raise and lower the indices 
with the charge conjugation matrices  and 
. For that 
reason one has in   two independent representations: 
  and .

In  dimensions, one can also define spinors  and  which 
transform under Lorentz transformations such that  and 
 are invariant. If we denote the generators of  by 
 with ,  those for  are given by 
. Of course these matrices form also a representation 
of the Lorentz group, but they are not inequivalent representations. It is easy to check that in the representation 
given above, the Lorentz generators for the spinors , and  
are given, respectively, by 
  
Thus in  dimensions  transforms like , 
and  like . Hence, one may omit the dots without causing confusion, but it matters whether one 
has upper or lower indices. For  dimensions one has just the opposite situation: the representation 
to which  and  belong is inequivalent to the representation to which  and 
 belong. 

We conclude that chiral spinors are given by , antichiral spinors by  and in the text we use 
the twenty real symmetric  matrices  and  (omitting again the 
dots in the latter). The matrices  satisfy 

 and 
. The latter relation makes Fierz rearrangements very easy. 
The usual Fierz rearrangement for 3 chiral spinors becomes then simply 
the statement that  vanishes when totally symmetrized in the indices  and . In particular, 
ccccc 
(^m ) _m=0.  
 
 

 
 
The WZNW term  
 
We follow. 
The WZNW term  is proportional to  (with 
) hence  can be written as a 2-form 
WWA  
_2 L _WZ  d^2x. 
  
Since  is susy invariant up to a total derivative, 
we have 
WWB  
__2 = d X. 
  
 
Define now a 3-form  as follows: . Then clearly, 
WWC  
__3 = 0,         d _3 = 0. 
  
 
 From  it is natural to try to construct 
 from the susy-invariant 1-forms  and . 
Lorentz invariance then yields only one possibility 
WWD  
_3 = a_ij  ^m d ^i ^m d ^j. 
  
where  is a real symmetric  matrix. We diagonalize  by a real orthogonal 
transformation (which leaves , and thus  in () invariant). Then 
. 
In  the direct terms cancel due to the 
standard identity , while the cross-terms cancel only if 
 and if the diagonal matrix  has entries . Hence 
WWD_  
_3 =  i ^m ( d ^1 _m d ^1 - d^2 ^m d^2    ). 
  
Using that , 
we find the WZNW term up to an overall constant 
WWE  
L _WZ  =  1   ^  
[ - i 
_x^m ( ^1 _m _^1 - ^2 _m _^2 ) + ^1 _m _^1  ^2 ^m _^2 
]. 
  
Indeed, with  one gets
  
which is equal to 
WWG  
_3 = - i (d x^m - ^1_m d ^1 - ^2^m d^2 ) ( d^1_m d^1 - d^2_m d^2 ). 
  
 
Note that the WZNW term is antisymmetric in  and  while  
is symmetric. Only the sum of  and  is -invariant, up to a total 
derivative. The -transformation rule for  is 
 with the opposite 
sign to the susy rule. The expressions 
for  and  are complicated, involving self-dual 
and antiselfdual anticommuting gauge parameters with 3 indices, but we do not need them. We begin 
with the BRST law  where  is an unconstrained ghost field, but the precise 
classical action to which this corresponds is not know at the present. That does not matter as long as 
we can construct the complete quantum theory, although knowledge of the classical action might clarify the 
results obtained at the quantum level. 
 
For the open string one has the following boundary conditions at  
WWH  
^1 i  = ^2 i ,      
^1 i  = ^2 i ,      
h^  _x^m =0,      
^1 _t = ^2 _t = -h  ^1  = -h  ^2 . 
  
 

 
A useful identity for the superstring  
 
The superstring action is given by 
GS  
L  = -  1  2      _mn   ^m_^n   + L _WZ  , 
  





 
where  is given in . 
For definiteness we choose  and  as well as 
 have . This action is real. 
 
By just writing out all the terms, the action can be re-written with chiral 
derivatives 
GSA  
- L  = _mn   x^m x^n 
- i x^m  ^1 _m ^1 
- i x^m  ^2 _m ^2 
  



 
with  and . 
 
Except for the purely bosonic terms, all terms involve either  or . Hence 
we can write the action as 
GSB  
- L  = 1 2  _mn   x^m x^n + (p_1  )_Sol   ^1   + 
(p_2  )_Sol   ^2  
  
where  are complicated composite expressions. 


 
We can then 
also write the action with independent  if we impose the constraint that 
 vanishes. 
The complete expressions for  are given by 
GSC  
d_1   = p_1   +  i x^m _m ^1 + 
1 2   (^m ^1)( ^1 _m ^1 + ^2 _m ^2) , 
  



 
In the text we work with the free action with independent fields . The 
 are transferred to the BRST charge where they are multiplied by the independent 
unconstrained real chiral commuting spinors .  To make use of the calculation technique 
of conformal field theory, we make a Wick rotation , 
 and  and analogously for . 
We also restrict ourselves to only one sector with  and , by setting . 
For a treatment which describes both sectors, we refer to . 
 

 
Solution of the pure spinor constraints.  
 
In this appendix we discuss a solution of the constraint that the 
chiral spinors  are pure spinors. The equation to be solved 
reads 
puu  
^^m_  ^=0, 
  
where  are complex chiral (16-component) spinors. We shall decompose  w.r.t. a non-compact 
version of a  subgroup of  as 
. 
This decomposition corresponds to . Then 
we shall show that the constraints express the  in terms of the  and . 
Hence there are 11 independent complex components in . We shall prove that  is complex and not a Majorana 
spinor, so  differs from . 
(Recall that a Majorana spinor is defined by the 
condition ). 
 
The Dirac matrices in  dimensions satisfy , where  is 
diagonal with entries  for . We combine them into 5 annihilation operators  
and 5 creation operators  as follows 
puuA  
a_1 = (^1 + i ^2),       
a_2 = (^3 + i ^4),         
a_5 = (^9 -  ^0). 
  




 
Clearly  for . We introduce a vacuum  
with . By acting with one or more  on  , we obtain 32 states  
with . . 
Similarly, we introduce a state  which satisfies   and we create 32 states  by acting 
with one or more  on . We choose the states  as . For example, 
if  then . Then 
. 
 
 
Lemma 1:  The matrix elements  and 
 form a representation 
of the Clifford algebra. 
 
Proof:  This follows from . Namely, 

, where the sum over  runs over the 32 states shown. 
For any state  one has , because 
 by construction. 
 
Lemma 2:  The chirality matrix  satisfies , and 
. It is given by 
puuB  
_ = (2 a_1 a^1 -1) ( 2 a_5 a^5 -1) . 
  
 
Proof:   and 
. As a check note that , and that 
 because . Similarly . Further, 
. 
 
Lemma 3:   real. 
 
Proof:  This follows from the fact that one obtains the second matrix element 
from the first by left-right reflection, and from the fact that the anticommutation 
relations have the same symmetry and are real: . 
 
Lemma 4:  The matrix representation of  is real 
and symmetric while that of  is purely imaginary and antisymmetric, 
and that of  is real and antisymmetric. 
 
Proof:  . 
 
Lemma 5:  The charge conjugation matrix , defined by  is given by 
. The minus sign is added for later 
convenience. 
 
Proof:   anticommute with , while 
 commute with , the former are symmetric while the latter are antisymmetric. 
 
Theorem I:  A chiral spinor  can be expanded as follows 
puuD  
l= _+  0+ 
1 2 !   _ij  a^j a^i 0+  1 4 !   ^i _ijklm  a^j a^k  a^l a^m 0. 
  
 
Proof:  ; hence . The 16 non-vanishing 
components of  are the projections of the ket  onto the corresponding 16 bras: 
in particular 
puuE  
_+ = 0 l= 0 , 
      
_ij  = 1 2 !   0a_i a_j l= 1 2 !   
 a^j a^i0 , 
  



 
 
We are now ready to solve the ten constraints . These 
relations are equivalent to the five constraints  and the five other 
constraints . They can be rewritten as follows 
puuF  
 C a^j  l= 0,       
 C a_j  l. 
  
 
Theorem II:   iff  is 
proportional to precisely . 
 
Proof:   and , Further  
and . Pulling all  in  to the right of 
, we obtain, up to an overall sign,  and this is only non-vanishing if all  in 
 match the  in . It follows that . 
 
First set of constraints  
puuG  
 C a^i_0   l= 0C ( _+ + 1 2   _ij  a^i a^j + 
1 4 !   ^i a^j a^k a^l a^m _ijklm  ) a^i_0  l
   


 
 
Second set of constraints  
puuH  
 C a_i_0   l= 0C ( _+ + 1 2   _ij  a^i a^j + 
1 4 !   ^i a^j a^k a^l a^m _ijklm  ) a_i_0  l
   


 
 
Main Result:  The solution of the first set of constraints 
 is given by 
puuI  
^i = - 1 4 ! _+    ^i jklm  _jk  _lm . 
  
The solution automatically satisfies the second set of constraints because 
puuK  
^i _in  = ^ijklm  _jk  _lm  _in  = 0. 
  
 
Proof:  A totally antisymmetric tensor with  indices in 5 dimensions vanishes. Hence 
 is equal to a sum of 5 terms, due to exchange  with  and , respectively. Interchanging 
 with  yields minus the original tensor, but also interchanging  with  and  yields each time minus the original 
expression. Hence the expression vanishes. 
 
Comment 1:  The fact that a pure chiral spinor contains 
11 independent complex components leads to a vanishing 
central charge in Berkovits' approach with variables  and the 
conjugate momentum , and  with conjugate momentum : 
. 
In our approach we have  independent real component in  and 16 conjugate 
momenta  with . Also in our case , but there are more ghosts, and 
there is nowhere a decomposition w.r.t. a subgroup of . 
 
Comment 2:  
In the decomposition in Theorem I, one can choose all 's to be real, and  to be expressed in terms 
of  and  as in . Then  is a real chiral spinor. However, the Dirac matrices are complex, 
so under a Lorentz transformation  becomes complex in a general Lorentz frame.

Our program applied to Yang-Mills theory  

The program of determining the theory by starting from a suitable set of constraints  
and a free action (for  and ) leads to a nilpotent BRST charge and a free action 
in the case of the superstring. Since the ideas are new we would like to see them at work in a simpler 
example. We therefore study in this section whether also for standard pure 
Yang-Mills field theory similar ideas can be implemented and what results they lead to. 
 
We begin with Yang-Mills fields and write the gauge transformations as 
BRST-like transformations by introducing a ghost field  for each 
infinitesimal gauge parameter 
YMa s_0  A = c = d  c - [A, c] ,           s_0  c =0.  
The law  corresponds to  and 
 corresponds to . In string theory we have "brackets" 
which are the contractions and propagators of conformal field theory. 
To also introduce brackets for  and , we introduce antifields  and 
 and define the antibracket 
YMc  
(X,Y) =_l X z^A  
_r  Y  z^*_A  - 
_l  X  z^*_A  _r  Y  z^A  
  
for any  in the algebra  to construct the rest of the terms 
in . We introduce  as conjugate variable 
to  such that  
and . Notice that though the 
fields  are antifields themselves, in the present section we assign 
antifield number zero to them. In addition, we are not taking into account the Yang-Mills 
equation of motion, but we are only discussing the gauge invariant observables and 
not the observables modulo equations of motion. In the following, we will use 
the antifields as conjugate momenta. The relation between the antibracket  and Poisson 
bracket has been extensively discussed in the literature and we refer to 

 and 

. 
 
The transformation laws in  are generated by . 
This corresponds to . 
The symmetry in  is not the BRST symmetry because it is not 
nilpotent:  
where  is the Lie algebra bracket. However, we can apply again the ideas of 
homological perturbation theory to impose  as a constraint. This resembles the pure spinor constraint . 
The constraint  is an abelian first 
class constraint and it generates the gauge transformations 
 where  is a vector in the adjoint representation and  is the trace operation. 
Finally, the square of the  transformations of the fields gives (with ) 
YMaa  
s^2_0 A = ( -1 2   [c,c] ) ,    
s^2_0 A^* =[ -1 2   [c,c], A^* ] ,    
s^2_0 c =0,    
s^2_0 c^* = _A^*  A^*, 
  
which shows that  is nilpotent on the 
surface of the constraints modulo gauge transformations. 

We introduce a new anticommuting field  and a differential  such that 
 maps  into the constraint, and  has antifield number 
, and . 
YMb 
 ^* = -1 2   [c,c],       A =0,       c = 0,  


 
We then define the pure ghost number  as the sum of the antifield 
number and the ghost number. 
It is easy to check that . Applying the theorem of homological 
pertubation theory, the two 
operations can be merged in only one nilpotent  since 
the BRST-like transformation  is nilpotent modulo -exact terms. 
 
A simple exercise shows that 
YMd 
  
  ^* = -1 2   [c,c],     
s_0   ^* = - [^*,c],     
s_1   ^* = - 1 2   [^*,^*], 
  




 




 




 




 




 
As we already recalled, the construction of the BRST charge, 
which contains both the Koszul-Tate differential  and the 
BRST-like differential , is unique up to a (anti) 
canonicalAnticanonical 
transformations are generated by the antibracket 
 where  is a 
fermionic generator.  
transformation, for example a field redefinition. If 
we shift  with the ghost field and we 
rename this field  (and in the same way ), 
we find out that these transformations can be generated by 
 where  is 
YMe  
S_  = 
d^4x ( A^* C + 1 2   C^* [C,C] ). 
  
The Lagrangian  is clearly the usual antifield 
dependent terms of the Yang-Mills Lagrangian. Finally, one can study 
the cohomology of the BRST operator  and one easily finds out 
that the cohomology coincides with the gauge invariant observables of YM theory. 
 
Notice that by means of the redefinition, we cannot use the 
antifield number to select the resolution of the Koszul-Tate  any longer. 
Fortunately, in the present case it easy to study the cohomology  directly. 
In addition, the antifield number is protected (it cannot be too negative!!) because 
it is equal to the ghost number.
