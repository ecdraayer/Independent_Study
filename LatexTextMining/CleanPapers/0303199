 In this  note we will study 
 solution of open bosonic string field theory
based on  action of operators from chiral algebra
of boundary conformal field theory on identity element
of string field theory star algebra. We will demonstrate that the
string field theory action for fluctuation fields  around
this classical solution  can be mapped to  the string field theory action
defined through the  new   boundary conformal
field theory that arises from the original one
through the marginal deformation inserted on  the
world-sheet  boundary.

Introduction Much work has focused on the search 
for classical solutions of cubic bosonic open
string field theory (SFT)(For review, see
.). Despite important technical
progress in the understanding of the open string
star product-notably the discovery of a
new connections with non-commutative field theory


it is still very difficult to find analytic classical solution.
Exception is the special form of 
SFT, vacuum string field theory  (VSFT), where
 exact results have been obtained



.

 In our recent  papers
we found  some  exact solutions of 
SFT equation of motion
(For closely
related papers, see 
.) .
All these solutions have the property  that when
we expand the string field
 around this solution and insert it into the  
SFT action then the  
 new BRST operator  
suggests that SFT action  for fluctuation modes
is in some sense related   to  the SFT action defined around the
new  background boundary conformal field theory ()
 that arises from
the original    by presence
of marginal deformation on the world-sheet boundary.
The possible relation between these two actions 
will be indication of the background independence 
of SFT 

  which unfortunatelly is not
explicitly seen in its formulation.  Let us say more about this issue.

This issue arises because SFT can be written after choosing what
amounts to a classical solution, namely  with central charge
. As a result the SFT actions  written
using two different   and 
 are not manifestly equivalent. However it was shown in

 that for the case when 
   and 
 are nearby theories related by infinitesimal 
marginal deformation, one can prove that  and
 are the same action expanded around different 
solutions. 

In this paper we will try to study this problem
from slightly different point of view. In particular,   we focus on 
the  relation between  solution of SFT equation of
motion given in
 and the marginal  deformation in  . 
Our goal is to show that when we   expand  string
field around classical solution and insert it  into
 the original
SFT action  which is defined on background , we obtain after suitable
redefinition of the fluctuation modes  
the SFT action   defined on   that
is related to the original   by inserting marginal
deformation on the boundary of the world-sheet 
(For more details about marginal deformations in
, see
.). To say differently,
we will show that two SFT actions  written
using two different   which are 
 related by marginal deformation, are in fact two SFT
actions expanded around different classical solutions. 

In order to show this equivalence  will consider 
 operators, that determine exact solution of
SFT, which  
belong to the chiral algebra  of 

(For very nice review to the subject of 
 see for example
 and reference therein.) .
More precisely,  we will construct the solution of SFT equation of motion
that is based on an action of some operator 
from   on the SFT star algebra
 identity element .
Then we will study the fluctuation modes around this
solution. It turns out that after performing suitable redefinition
of the fluctuation modes  we will  get  correlation 
functions  
(These  correlation functions  
 define SFT action   in the CFT description
.) 
which have the same form as the correlation functions in the deformed
 that arises from the original one by insertion of
marginal interaction  on the  world-sheet boundary.
In order to be able to perform such a identification
we took  the operators  from  
since only in that case we have
 well defined  deformed correlation functions
in  containing bulk and boundary operators
as well as operator  
. 
  In other words we will show
that the SFT action   for fluctuation modes is the same
as the SFT action defined by the second . This result can be considered
as more precise extension  of  the analysis given in 
 in the sense that we explicitly
show the equivalence of these two actions. 
We mean that this result could be considered as 
further indication of  the  background independence
in SFT
.








The organization of this paper  is as follows. In the
next section () we review the basic facts about
SFT, bulk an boundary CFT. Then we turn to the construction
of the classical solution of SFT equation of motion following

.
In section () we will study  
fluctuation modes above the classical solution
and we will find the precise relation between
the SFT   for fluctuation modes and SFT defined 
on . 
In conclusion () we will  outline our results. 






General solutions We begin this section with the review  the basic facts about
bosonic string field theory, following
mainly
. Gauge invariant
string field theory is described with the
full Hilbert space of the first quantized open
string including  ghost fields subject
to the condition that the states must
carry ghost number one, where  has ghost
number ,  has ghost number  and
 invariant vacuum 
carries ghost number . We denote
 the subspace of the full Hilbert
space carrying ghost number .  Any state
in  will be denoted as 
and corresponding vertex operator 
is the  vertex operator that  creates state 
out of the vacuum state 
 
Since we are dealing with open string theory,
the vertex operators should be put on the boundary
of the world-sheet
(Since these states describe open string they 
belong to the class so-named boundary operators
in  that live on
the real line  for .) . 
  The string field theory action
is given
 
where  is open string coupling constant, 
is BRST operator and  denotes correlation function
in the combined matter ghost conformal field theory in
the upper half plane .
 are conformal mapping  exact
form of which is reviewed in and  denotes
the conformal transformation of  by . For
example, for  a primary field of dimension ,
then . 
In  our calculation we use convention from
the very nice review
 
with the BRST operator 
 
where  is holomorphic and 
 is anti-holomorphic
current  and where  are
holomorphic and anti-holomorphic  stress energy tensor
for the ghosts. 
In what follows we will not need
to know the  explicit form of the ghost contribution.

It turns out   that the natural definition of
the string field theory is in language of 
.
  are usually regarded  as associated boundary theories
to the bulk CFT theories. Recall that bulk CFT are
defined on the whole complex plane and they appear in
the world-sheet description of the closed strings. Their
state spaces  contain all the closed
string modes and the coefficients  of their operator
product expansions  (OPE) encode closed string interactions.
The space  is equipped with the
action of a Hamiltonian  and of field
operators . According to
state-field correspondence we have an identification
 
Among the fields of a CFT one distinguishes so-called
chiral fields which depend on only one of the coordinates
 or  so that they are either holomorphic,
, or anti-holomorphic, 
. The (anti)-holomorphic fields of given theory,
or their Laurent modes  defined
through 
 
generate two commuting chiral algebras  and
. 
 The most important of these
chiral fields, the Virasoro fields 
with modes  are among
the chiral fields and  numbers  are the (half-)integer
conformal weights of .

   are conformal field theories on the upper
half-plane  which in the interior  
are locally equivalent to the given bulk theory: The
state space  of the  is equipped with the action
of a Hamiltonian  and of bulk fields 
 
which are assigned to the same fields as were used to
label filed in the bulk theory. However these
fields  act on a different space of states
. We also demand that all the leading
terms in the OPE's of bulk fields coincide with
the OPE's in the bulk theory. Having the same singularities
as in the bulk theory means that the boundary conditions do not affect
the equation of motion in the bulk. 
We must also require the boundary theory to be conformal.
This is guaranteed if the Virasoro field obeys
the following gluing condition
 
We also presume that all chiral fields 
 can
be extended analytically to the real
line and that there exist a local automorphism
-called the gluing  map of the chiral
algebra   such that
 
Now the assumption of the existence of
the gluing map  has powerful 
consequence that it gives rise to an
action of one chiral algebra  
on the state space  of the boundary
theory. More precisely, we combine
the chiral fields  and
 into single
object   defined on the
whole complex plane such that
 
Thanks to the gluing condition along the boundary 
this field is analytic and we can expand it in
a Laurent series 
 
so that we introduce the modes  that 
acts on the Hilbert space . Then we can
obtain the modes  through the
integration over the curve in the upper half
complex plane
 
where  is curve in the upper half plane that
is labeled as 
. 
It is important to stress that there is just one
such action of  constructed out
of the two chiral fields  and .

After this short review of  we return
to the SFT  and its
equation of motion. Note that in  the abstract language 
the  open string field theory action ()
is
 
from which we immediately get an equation of motion
 
It is easy to see that the string field in the form
 
is solution of () for any ghost number zero
operator  acting on the SFT star  algebra 
 identity element   which is ghost number zero
string field that obeys
 
 
for any string field 
(For recent study of the identity element
, see

.) .
Let us consider   operator 
 in ()
from  the chiral algebra  of
 in the form 
 
where   are holomorphic,
anti-holomorphic fields respectively of
conformal weight    which
 transform under general conformal transformations
 as
 
Then we immediately get that  is invariant under
conformal transformations
 
using the fact that  does not depend on
the integration contour  as a  consequence of
gluing conditions ().


We can also define an action 
of  on identity field directly in CFT language, following
.
Instead to taking  as identity
element of star algebra we will define its through the
relation
 
where 
 
In this approach 
the identity field is considered as state that belong to family
of wedge states
.
 Wedge state   of an angle  
 is defined 
 
It follows that  is 
the wedge state  of an angle
.
In this description we define action of the operator
 on  as 
 
Using invariance of   
under conformal transformation we immediately get 
that  annihilates any wedge state since
 
by deforming the contour  until it shrinks
to a point at infinity where there is no
other operator. In the upper expression 
we  used 
standard doubling trick
to express   through
holomorphic current . 
Let us apply this result for identity field
 and write , where
subscripts  denote the integrals of
holomorphic and anti-holomorphic currents
 over left and right side of
the string respectively. Then we immediately get
 
For our next purposes it is  important following
"partial integration formula" 
 
where   are general string fields. 
Recent very nice discussion of
the upper expression can be found in,
where instead of operator  the BRST operator
 is considered. 
The proof given there can be easily applied for general
operator that is invariant under conformal 
transformations so that () is valid
for  too.

Let us return to the  solution of SFT
(). We observe  that it has the form of 
pure gauge. This fact certainly deserves
deeper explanation.  As is well known the
  string field theory action
()  is invariant 
under  small gauge transformations 
 
where  is ghost number zero string field.
 On the other hand the action ()   is not generally
invariant under the large gauge transformations 
 
As is well known there is a sharp distinction between
the small gauge transformations and the large ones, 
for very nice discussion, 
see . As was argued there,
 small gauge transformation describes redundancy in
our description of the theory. 
On the other hand, large
gauge transformations are true symmetries that relate
different solutions in given gauge theory which in our
case is the open bosonic  string field theory. We will
see that this interpretation of the large
gauge transformation is the appropriate one in
case of (). To support this claim
let us start to study  fluctuation
modes around .  
As usually we expand  string field   as
 
and insert it  in ().
Then we obtain an
action for the fluctuation field  in
the same form as  the original one
() 
 
where    the new  BRST operator
 was introduced 
 
In order to obtain the new form of the BRST
operator () we will follow the calculation
given  in. 
We start with the function
 
and perform Taylor expansion around the
point 
 
where
  
and consequently
 
It is important to stress that for validity of
the calculation given above  must obey 
the relation (). We have
also  used 
.  
From  () 
 see that we can express  
as a result of the action 
of the ghost number one operator
 acting on the identity field. 
Then we immediately
obtain
 
This form of the shifted BRST operator  is
 convenient for the analysis of 
fluctuation modes around solution
() as we show in the next
section. 



Relation between  SFT action
 and the deformation in   In the previous section we have found an exact
solution of the string field theory and
also 
an action for fluctuation modes 
 
Upper expression  implies that it
is natural to  consider  following redefinition
of fluctuation states 
 
where  are boundary operators
in  which are localized at point  on 
the real line. 
Using the fact that  annihilates vacuum
state  we can write
 
hence 
 
so that we can define 
the vertex operator for fluctuation field as
 
where  are small circles around the point
 and where their radii are given as
 and in the end
of the calculation we take the limit 
.
In the previous expression we have slightly moved
the insertion point  above to real axis in order
to perform contour integration. As a result the
second term in  has no singularity with  and
hence we can consider the holomorphic field
 only. 
   
When we insert () into 
() we get 
 
Using () we obtain
 
so that the SFT
action  for fluctuation modes can be written as
 
where we have defined deformation 
of boundary correlators 
 
The form of the action 
() is the main result of our paper
which  says   that when we perform 
redefinition of fluctuation modes as in (),
then the  SFT  
() is the same as the
SFT action  defined on
the background  that arises from the
original one through  marginal deformation inserted
on the real line . 
More precisely, 
the general prescription of the boundary deformation
in  given  is as follows. We start with 
some  with the state space 
where  denotes the boundary 
condition along the real line. Boundary operators
 may be used to define a  
new perturbed  whose correlation functions are constructed
from the unperturbed ones by the formal expansion
 
where  is  a real parameter. From the
second line it is clear that the symbol
 in the first line should be
understood as a path ordered exponential of
the perturbing operator
 
We must mention that given expression is rather formal
and suffers from UV divergences and should be
regularized. For more detailed discussion, see
again.
And finally 
()  defines  deformations of
bulk correlators only. If there are extra boundary
fields present in the correlation function, these formulas
have to be modified so that these boundary fields
are included in the path ordering. However for
special class the boundary deformations these
formulas simplify considerably 
. 
In () the boundary operator  has
conformal dimension . For  
the perturbation will automatically introduce
length scale and we have to follow  the
renormalization group flow to come back .
However as was stressed in 
all these general perturbations  have 
common feature that the new  is associated
to the same bulk . As a conclusion, the boundary
perturbations can only induce changes of the boundary 
conditions. For marginal deformations with  this
implies that the boundary deformation induces 
the change of the original  with the gluing condition
 to the new  with the new gluing
condition , where the precise form of the 
  depends on the nature of  .

Let us consider the deformation of correlators
that contain boundary fields as well. It was shown
in  that () admits 
for the obvious generalization 
 
if and only if the boundary fields  are
local with respect to the perturbing field 
, where two boundary fields
 are said to be local if
 
This equation is supposed to hold after insertion into
arbitrary correlation functions and the right hand side to
make sense it is required that there exists a
unique analytic continuation from  to
. We also say that a boundary field  
is called self local or analytic if it is mutually
local with respect to itself. For example, the OPE
of a self-local boundary field  with conformal
dimension  is determined up to a constant
to be
 
After appropriate renormalization 
 the correlation function
() can be written as 
 
where  is the straight line parallel to the
real axis with  and
where the fields 
 are given
 
Note that  boundary fields 
from the chiral algebra  are  local with respect
to themselves  to all other boundary and bulk fields
in the theory so that () can 
be applied to correlators involving
arbitrary bulk and boundary fields. Then we 
see that () is special case of
() with no bulk operators inserted 
 and that () has the same
form as (). Consequently  we can claim that
redefinition of fluctuation modes () in
 () maps this action to 
the SFT action () that
describes SFT action  defined on background . 



Conclusion In this  note we have studied the
solution of open bosonic SFT based on the 
existence of marginal operators  from the
chiral algebra   of , where
 is the classical background on which
 given SFT 
is defined.  We have mainly focused  on 
the relation between the fluctuation field around
the classical solution and the deformed 
that Arieses from the original  by inserting
marginal interaction on the real line. 
We  have seen that after
an expansion of the string field around the
classical solution and its insertion to 
the original action we obtain the SFT action 
that after redefinition of
fluctuation fields  is written using
 correlators that are deformations
of the correlators in  through 
introduction of perturbation  from
the chiral algebra  on the real line.
In other words, we have shown that two string
field theory actions  defined using
two  ,  where these two
   are related
through marginal deformations from the chiral algebra
(It is important that  is not infinitesimal.), 
are in fact an expansion of SFT action around
different classical solutions. We mean that this 
result could be considered as an additional evidence
of the  background independence of open bosonic string
field theory  
even in case of general deformation
parameter . We also hope that
this result could be helpful for recent
application of SFT, for example for the
study of the rolling tachyon solution. 
We hope to return to this problem in future.
