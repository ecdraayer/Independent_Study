Algebraic Bethe ansatz  for the elliptic quantum group
   and its applications
  

 
We study the tensor product of the higher spin
representations  (see the definition in Sect. 2.2) of the elliptic
quantum group .  The  transfer matrices associated  with the
-module are exactly diagonalized  by the nested Bethe ansatz
method. Some special cases of the construction give the exact solution
for the  Belavin model and for the elliptic 
Ruijsenaars-Schneider model.

Introduction 

Bethe ansatz method  has  proved to be the most powerful and
(probably) unified method to construct the common eigenvectors of
commuting families of operators (usually called transfer
matrices ) in two-dimensional integrable models
. Faddeev et al reformulated the Bethe
ansatz method  in a representation theory form:  transfer
matrices  are associated with  representations of certain algebras
with quadratic relations (now called quantum groups). The
eigenvectors are constructed by  acting certain algebra elements
on the " highest weight vectors". This type of  Bethe ansatz
is known as  the algebraic Bethe ansatz.


Whereas this construction has been very successful in rational and
trigonometric integrable models, its extension
to elliptic models had been problematic due to the fact that for
the underlying algebras - Sklyanin algebras
 the highest weight representations were not properly
defined. Therefore, the algebraic Bethe ansatz method had not be
applied to the elliptic integrable models directly.

Recently, a definition of elliptic quantum groups
 associated with any simple classical
Lie algebra  was given. The highest
weight  representations of the elliptic quantum groups (cf.
 Sklyanin algebras) are now well-defined
. This enabled Felder et al to apply
successfully  the algebraic Bethe ansatz method for constructing
the eigenvectors of the transfer matrices  of the elliptic
integrable models associated with   modules over
.

In this paper, we will extend the above construction of Bethe
ansatz method  further to the elliptic quantum group . After
briefly reviewing the definition of the elliptic quantum group
, we study  one parameter series of highest weight
representations (higher spin representations ) of , and
introduce the associated operator algebra and the transfer
matrices  corresponding to the -module in section 2. In
section 3, we describe the algebraic Bethe ansatz for .
Finally, we give some applications of our construction to the
 Belavin models in section 4, and the elliptic
Ruijsenaars-Schneider model associated to  root system in
section 5.










The elliptic quantum group and its modules associated to  
 The elliptic quantum group associated to  
We first review the definition of the elliptic quantum group 
associated to . Let
 be the orthonormal basis of
the vector space  such that 
. The  simple roots are
 and the
fundamental weights  satisfying
 are given by
_i=_k=1 ^i _k-i n _k=1 ^n _k. Set
i =_i- ,   =
1 n _k=1 ^n _k,  i=1,,n,  then   _i=1 ^ni =0. For each
dominant weight ,
there exists an irreducible highest weight finite-dimensional
representation  of  with the highest vector 
. For example the fundamental vector representation is
. In this paper, we only consider the symmetric
tensor-product representation of

 (or, the higher spin- representation  of
), namely, the one parameter series of highest weight
representations , with
^(l) =l_1,  l  and    l>0.
This corresponds to the Young diagram
.


Let  be the Cartan subalgebra of  and  be its
dual. A finite dimensional diagonalizable  -module is a
complex finite dimensional vector space  with a weight
decomposition , so that  acts on
 by , . For
example, the fundamental vector representation ,
the non-zero weight spaces are .

Let us fix  such that  and a generic complex
number . For convenience, we introduce another parameter
 related to .  Let us introduce  the following
elliptic functions
&&
(u)=[ ](u,),    
^(j) (u)=[ ](u,n),


&&[
 ](u,)=_m=- ^ 
-1 [(m+a)^2+2(m+a)(u+b)] .
For a generic complex weight ,  we
introduce a  weight lattice with a shift by ,  as
follows
P _ =+_i=1 ^n m_ii ,   m_i.
For , define
_i=,_i,
  _ij =_i-_j=,_i-_j,  i,j=1,,n.
In this paper, we restrict  
 so that the inverse of the matrix  in
() does exist. Let 
 be the R-matrix given by
&&R(z,)=_i=1 ^n R^ii _ii (z,)E_ii E_ii 
+_ij R^ij _ij (z,)E_ii E_jj +
R^ji _ij (z,)E_ji E_ij ,

 in which  is the matrix with
elements . The coefficient functions
are &&R^ii _ii (z,)=1,  
R^ij _ij (z,)=(z)(_ij w+w) 
(z+w)(_ij w) ,

&& R^ji _ij (z,)=(w)(z+_ij w) 
(z+w)(_ij w) ,
and   is
defined in (). The R-matrix satisfies the dynamical
(modified) quantum Yang-Baxter equation
&&R_12 (z_1-z_2,(3) )R_13 (z_1-z_3,)
R_23 (z_2-z_3,(1) )

&&    =R_23 (z_2-z_3,)R_13 (z_1-z_3,(2) )R_12 (z_1-z_2,),
with the initial condition
R^kl _ij (0,)=^l_i ^k_j.We adopt the
notation:  acts on a tensor 
 as  if .

A representation of the elliptic quantum group  (an
-module) is  by definition a pair () where  is a
diagonalizable -module and  is a meromorphic function
of  and the spectral parameter ,  with values in
 (the endomorphism commuting with the
action of ). It obeys the so-called  relation
&&R_12 (z_1-z_2,(3) )L_13 (z_1,)
L_23 (z_2,(1) )

&&    =L_23 (z_2,)L_13 (z_1,(2) )R_12 (z_1-z_2,),
where the first and second space are auxiliary  spaces
() and the third space plays the role of quantum space
(). The total weight conservation condition for the
-operator reads
[h^(1) +h^(3) , L_13 (z,)]=0.In terms of the elements of the -operator defined by
L(z,)(e_iv)=_j=1 ^n e_jL^j_i(z,)v,  vW,
the above condition can be expressed
equivalently as
f(h)L_i^j(z,)=L^j_i(z,)f(h+i -j ),in which  is any meromorphic function of  and 
measures the weight of the quantum space ().


Modules over  and the associated operator algebra 
The basic example of an -module is  with
, which is called  the fundamental vector
representation  with the evaluation point . It
is obvious that  relation is satisfied as a consequence of
the dynamical Yang-Baxter equation (). Other modules can
be obtained by taking tensor products: if  and
 are -modules, where  acts on
(), then also  with
L(z,)=L^(1) (z,(2) )L^(2) (z,)  acting  on 
 ^nW_1W_2.An -submodule of an -module  is a pair 
where  is an -submodule of  such that 
 is invariant under the action of all the , and
 is the restriction to this invariant subspace. Namely,
the -submodules are -modules.

Using the fusion rule of  () one can construct the
symmetric -submodule of -tensors of fundamental vector
representations: V_^(l)  (z_1)= symmetric 
subspace of V__1 (z_1)V__1 (z_1-w)V__1 (z_1-(l-1)w),where  is defined by (). We call such an
-module  the higher spin- representation  with
evaluation point . These series of representations in the
case of  Sklyanin algebra have been studied infor  case and in for generic  case.
 From direct calculation, we find  that the -module
 is an irreducible highest weight module of 
with the highest vector 
. It satisfies the following highest weight
conditions
&&L^1_1(u,)^(l) (l) ,  L^i_1(u,)^(l) 
&&L^i _j (u,)^(l) i _j  (u-z) (_i1 w+lw)  (u-z+lw) (_i1 w) 
^(l) ,  i,j=2,,n,

&&f(h)^(l) 1 )^(l) ,
where  is any meromorphic function of , which measures
the weight of the quantum space .



For any -module, as in one can define an
associated operator algebra of difference operators on the space
 of meromorphic functions of  with
values in . The algebra is  generated by  and the operators
 acting as
L (z)(e_if)()=_j=1 ^n e_jL_i^j (z,)f(i ).One can derive  the following
exchange relation of the difference operator 
from the "RLL" relation (), the weight
conservation condition of  ()
  and  the fact
  ,
&&R_12 (z_1-z_2,L _13 (z_1) L _23 (z_2)
=L _23 (z_2)L _13 (z_1)R_12 (z_1-z_2,),


&&f(h)L _i^j(z)=
L ^j_i(z)f(h+i -j ),where 
is any meromorphic function of  and  measures the weight of
the quantum space .



The transfer matrices  associated to an -module 
 is a difference operator acting on the space
 of meromorphic functions of  with values in the
zero-weight space of . It is defined by
T(u)f()=_i=1 ^n L ^i_i(u)f()
=_i=1 ^n L^i _i (u,)f(i ). The exchange relation of -operators
() and () imply that, for any
-module,  the above transfer matrices  
preserve the space  of functions with values in the
zero weight space . Moreover,  they commute pairwise on :




In  this paper we will study  the tensor product -module 

. With the generic evaluation
points , the module is an irreducible highest weight
-module. Let
, then 
with
^(l_1) ,^(l_2) ,,
^(l_m) ^(l_1) ^(l_2) ^(l_m) .The vector ,
viewed as a constant function in , obeys the following
highest weight conditions:
&&L ^1_1(z)L ^i_1(z)L&&L ^i _j (z)i _j 
D_i(z,),  i,j=2,,n,   
f(h)1 ).The highest weight
functions read A(z,)=1,  
D_i(z,)=_k=1 ^m (z-p_k) (z-q_k) 
(_i1 w+Nw) (_i1 w) ,  i=2,,n,where p_k=z_k,  q_k=z_k-l_kw,   
N=_k=1 ^m l_k,  k=1,,m. 




Algebraic Bethe ansatz for  
  In this section we fix a
highest weight -module  of weight , the functions
  (), with the highest vector
. We assume that  with
 being an integer, so that the zero-weight space  can be
non-trivial and so that the algebraic Bethe ansatz method can be
applied as in.

Let us adopt the standard notation for convenience:
&&(u)=L ^1_1(u),  _i(u)=L ^1_i(u),  i=2,
,n,

&&_i(u)=L ^i_1(u),   ^j _i (u)=L ^j_i(u),
  i,j=2,,n.The transfer matrices 
become
T(u)=(u)+_i=2 ^n ^i_i(u).Any non-zero vector  is of form
, for some meromorphic function 
. When , the weight  can be  written in the
form
k=1 ^n-1 (_1-_k+1 ).
Noting
(), the zero-weight vector space is spanned by the
vectors of the following form
  _i_N_1  (v_N_1 )_i_N_1-1  (v_N_1-1 )_i_1 (v_1)
, where  and among
the indices , the number of
, denoted
  by , should be
  (j)=l,    j=2, , n.The above  states ()  actually  belong to the
zero-weight space , because
&&f(h)_i_N_1  (v_N_1 )_i_N_1-1  (v_N_1-1 )_i_1 (v_1)


&&   =_i_N_1  (v_N_1 )_i_N_1-1  (v_N_1-1 )_i_1 (v_1)

&&   =f(l_i=2 ^n i -(n-1)l1 +nl1 )

&&   =f(0)
_i_N_1  (v_N_1 )_i_N_1-1  (v_N_1-1 )_i_1 (v_1)
,for any meromorphic function . We will seek
the common eigenvectors of the transfer matrices   in
the form ;v_k=F^i_1,i_2,,i_N_1  (;v_k)
_i_N_1  (v_N_1 )_i_N_1-1  (v_N_1-1 )
_i_1 (v_1), with the
restriction condition () and the parameters
 will be specified later by the Bethe ansatz
equations (). We adopt here  the convention that the
repeated indices imply summation over , and the
notation that v_k=v^(0) _k, k=1,2,, N_1. Let us
introduce the following set of integers for convenience: N_i=(n-i)l,  i=1,2,, n-1.  From the exchange relations () and
(), one can derive the commutation relations among
 and   (for details,
see  Appendix A). The relevant commutation relations are
&&(u)_i(v)=r(v-u,_i1 )_i(v)(u)+s(u-v,_1i )_i(u)A(v),


&&^j_i(u)_l(v)=r(u-v, _j1 -h_j1 )_,n 
R^ _i l (u-v,)_ (v)^j_ (u)

&&                  -s(u-v,_1j -h_1j )_i(u)^j_l(v),

&&_i(u)_j(v)=_,n R^ _i j (u-v,)
_ (v)_ (u),

&&f(h)(u)=(u)f(h),  f(h)_i(u)=_i(u)f(h+i -1 ),


&&f(h)^j_i(u)=^j_i(u)f(h+i -j ), where the function  are defined by r(u,)=(u+w)(w) (u)(w+w) ,  
s(u,)=(w)(u+w) (u)(w-w) ,  .Because of the simple poles in  the functions 
at , let us  assume for convenience that all
 are distinct  and consider
 at a generic point. Take Vac-f  as the so-called
quasi-vacuum satisfying the following conditions &&(u)g(1 ) g() ,  _i(u)O&&^j _i (u)i _j D_i(u,)
 g(i ) g()  ,  i,j=2,,n,

&&f(h)1 ),   _i(u)0,
  i=2,,n,
where ,  and  are given
in () and (). We will specify the function
 later ()

Now, let us evaluate the action of  on
. Many terms will appear when we move
 from the left  to the right  of
's. They can be classified into two types: wanted and
unwanted terms. The wanted terms in
 can be obtained by retaining the
first term in the commutation relation (). The unwanted
terms arising from the second term of (), have some
  replaced by . One unwanted term where 
is replaced by  can be obtained by using firstly the second
terms of (), then repeatedly using the first term of
(). Thanks to the commutation relation (), one
can easily obtain the other unwanted terms  where  is
replaced by . So, we can find the action of  on

eigenvalues () should be independent of , one
needs to  choose (cf.) g()=e^n_1,  _j=2 ^n

  Thanks to  the commutation relations (), one can
obtain the explicit expressions of all the o.u.t . The
equation () tells that the state 
 is not an eigenvector of the transfer
matrices  unless   are the eigenvectors of the
reduced transfer matrices . The condition that the
third and fourth terms in the above equation should cancel each
other and also the all  terms vanish, will give a
restriction on the  parameters , the so-called
Bethe ansatz equations. Hence we arrive at the final results: T(u);v_kv_k) ;v_k

the Bethe ansatz equations ().

The diagonalization of the transfer matrices   is now
reduced to diagonalization of the reduced transfer matrices
 in (). The explicit expression of
 given in () implies that
 can be considered as the transfer matrices of an
-module  (or reduced space):  tensor product of
fundamental representations of  with evaluation points
. We can use the same method to find the eigenvalue
of  as we have done for the diagonalization of .
Similarly to ()-(), we introduce &&^(1) (u)=L ^(1) ^2_2(u),  ^(1) _i(u)=
L ^(1) ^2_i(u),  i=3, ,n,

&&^(1) _i(u)=L ^(1) ^i_2(u),   ^(1)  ^j _i (u)
=L ^(1) ^j_i(u),   i,j=3,,n. Then the
reduced transfer matrices ()  can be
rewritten T^(1) (u)=^(1) (u)+_i=3 ^n^(1)  ^i_i(u). We seek
the common eigenvectors of the reduced transfer matrices
 in an analogous form  to (): ;v^(1) _k^(1) 
=_i_1,,i_N_2 =3 ^n
F^(1)  ^i_1,i_2,,i_N_2  (;v^(1) _k)
^(1) _i_N_2  (v_N_2 ^(1) )^(1) _i_N_2-1  (v_N_2-1 ^(1) )
^(1) _i_1 (v_1^(1) )^(1) ,

with the restriction of zero-weight
conditions similar to ().
The quasi-vacuum 
is the corresponding highest weight vector in the reduced space
. We can also derive the relevant commutation
relations among ,  and 
 similar  to ()-(). Using
the same method as we have done for the diagonalization of ,
we obtain the eigenvalue of the reduced transfer matrices
:
T^(1) (u);v^(1) _k^(1) =
t^(1) (u;v^(1) _k) ;v^(1) _k
^(1) .
Though very complicated, the coefficients
 could be extracted from the
eigenvectors ,  in principle.
  The eigenvalue
 is given by
t^(1) (u;v^(1) _k)&=& e^(2-n)^(1)  w 
_k=1 ^N_2 (v^(1) _k-u+w) 
(v^(1) _k-u) 

&&   +e^^(1)  w 
_k=1 ^N_2 (u-v^(1) _k+w) 
(u-v^(1) _k) 
_k=1 ^N_1 (u-v_k) (u-v_k+w) 
t^(2) (u;v^(2) _k).

&  The parameters
 will be specified later by the
Bethe ansatz equations (). The function
 is the eigenvalue of the second
reduced transfer matrices 
&&T^(2) (u)
F^(1)  ^i_1',,i_N_2 ' 
  (;v^(1) _k)=
  t^(2) (u;v^(2) _k)F^(1)  ^i_1',,i_N_2 ' 
  (;v^(1) _k),and  is given  by () and
() with  all indices taking values over
 and  depending on   instead of  .
Hence, the diagonalization of  is further
reduced to the diagonalization of  in ().
This is so-called nested Bethe ansatz.  Repeating the above
procedure further  times, one can reduce to the last reduced
transfer matrices  which is trivial to get the
eigenvalues. At the same time we need to introduce the
 parameters 
 to
specify the eigenvectors of the corresponding reduced transfer
matrices   (including the original one
), and  arbitrary complex numbers
 to specify the quasi-vacuum
 of each step as in
() and () . Finally, we obtain all the
eigenvalues of the reduced transfer matrices  with the
eigenvalue  in a recurrence
form
&&t^(i) (u;v^(i) _k)= e^(i+1-n)^(i)  w 
_k=1 ^N_i+1  (v^(i) _k-u+w) (v^(i) _k-u) 

&&      +e^^(i)  w 
_k=1 ^N_i+1  (u-v^(i) _k+w) (u-v^(i) _k) 
_k=1 ^N_i (u-p^(i) _k) (u-q^(i) _k) 
t^(i+1) (u;v^(i+1) _k),

&&                                i=0,1,,n-2,

&&t^(0) (u;v^(0) _k) =t(u;v_k),   t^(n-1) (u)=1,
where ,  are arbitrary complex
numbers, ,  and &&p^(0) _k=p_k=z_k,  q^(0) _k=q_k=z_k-l_kw,  k=1,2,,m,


&&p^(i) _k=v^(i-1) _k,  q^(i) _k=v^(i-1) _k-w,  i=1,2,,
n-2,   k=1,2,,N_i .
The 
satisfy the following Bethe ansatz equations
e^(i-n)^(i)  w   _k=1,ks ^N_i+1  (v^(i) _k-v^(i) _s+w) (v^(i) _k-v^(i) _s-w) =

_k=1 ^N_i (v^(i) _s-p^(i) _k) (v^(i) _s-q^(i) _k) 
t^(i+1) (v^(i) _s;v^(i+1) _k).We conclude this section with some remarks on analytic
properties of the functions . By
construction, the eigenvalue functions
 of the transfer matrices
should not be singular at 
() with 
. On the other hand, the Bethe ansatz equations () and
() are derived from the requirement that the unwanted terms
should vanish. It is interesting to note that
these constraints could be understood from a different point of view:
from equation
(), we know that 
()  is a possible simple pole position of
.
However, the constraints  on ,
the Bethe ansatz equations ()
simply tell that  the residue  of  at 
() is vanishing.
  Hence,  is analytic at
 (). Similarly, the Bethe ansatz
equations () ensure the analyticity of
 at all  ().
Therefore, the eigenvalues of transfer matrices  are analytic
functions of .





The  Belavin model 
  We shall show in this
section how to obtain the  eigenvectors and the corresponding
eigenvalues of the transfer matrices for   Belavin model
with periodic boundary condition from our results in section 3.

First, we construct the  Belavin R-matrix. Let
 be  matrices with the elements
&&g_ik =^i_ik ,   h_ik =_i+1,k ,

&&I_  =I_(_1,_2) =g^_2 h^_1 ,
where
 and
. We introduce the
-functions
_ (u)=[ ](u,),  _0,0 (u)=(u).
The  Belavin  model is based on the following R-matrix
R_B (u)=(w) n(u+w) _ Z_n^2 _  (u+w n ) _  (w n ) I_  I_  ^-1 ,which satisfies the quantum
Yang-Baxter equation
R_12 (u_1-u_2)R_13 (u_1-u_3)R_23 (u_2-u_3)=
R_23 (u_2-u_3)R_13 (u_1-u_3)R_12 (u_1-u_2),and
the initial condition: . For generic
evaluation points
, one then defines the commuting transfer matrices
&&T_B (u)=tr_0 L_B (u),

&&L_B (u)=R_B_01 (u-z_1)R_B_0m (u-z_m),where the L-operator 
acts on  and the transfer
matrices  act on .



Using the intertwiner introduced by Jimbo et al, we
can define the matrix  with the  elements

. When , the inverse matrix
of  exists. Then, one finds the following twisting
relation  holds: &&R_B_12 (u_1-u_2)
S(u_1,)^(1)  S(u_2,(1) )^(2) 

&&        =S(u_2,)^(2) S(u_1,(2) )^(1) 
R_12 (u_1-u_2,),in which  is defined by (), ()
and ().
The modified quantum
Yang-Baxter equation () and the quantum Yang-Baxter
equation () are equivalent to each other due to the
above twisting relation  (). Let us introduce
S_m (z_1,,z_m;)=S(z_m,)^(m) 
S(z_m-1 ,(m) )^(m-1) S(z_1,k=2 ^m h^(k) )^(1) .For the special case of  ,

we find that the L-operator
 corresponding to the -module  is equivalent to
the L-operator  of  Belavin model () by the
twisting relation 
&&S_m (z_1,,z_m;)S(u,(0) L(u,)

&&      =L_B (u)
S(u,)^(0) S_m (z_1,,z_m;(0) ).In this formula  acts on the factors from
 to , and . Acting the both sides
of () on a state  with ,
replacing  by , and noting (), we find
&&_j=1 ^n(S(u,+j )e_j)(S_m(z_1,,z_m;+i )L^j_i(u,+i )v)

&&      =L_B(u)(S(u,+i )e_i)(S_m(z_1,,z_m;)v).
Therefore,  one can
derive
T_B(u)S_m(z_1,,z_m;)_H =_i=1 ^n 
S_m(z_1,,z_m;+i )L^i_i(u,+i )_H ,
where   is preserved by the transfer matrices.


Let  be a linear functional on the space
 of functions of , such that 
, , for all 
. Extend  to vector-valued functional by acting
component-wise. Then for each eigenfunction  of 
with eigenvalue , the transfer matrices of  Belavin
model  act on the vector 

&&T_B(u) S_m(z_1,,z_m; )()
=_i=1 ^n S_m(z_1,,z_m;
+i )L^i_i(u,+i )()

&&      =_i=1 ^n S_m(z_1,,z_m;
)L^i_i(u,)(i )

&&      =S_m(z_1,,z_m;)T(u)()=t(u) S_m(z_1,,z_m;)(). Namely, the vector 
 is an eigenvector of 
with the same eigenvalue. Fortunately, such a linear functional on
 has been given in for XYZ spin
chain (-Belavin model) and its  higher spin generalizations
, for the generic  Belavin model.
And our results recover those of  for  case and
coincide with those of for  Belavin model.


As in, one can construct the higher spin
generalization of  Belavin model by putting at each  site a
local -operator
L_k(u;l_k)= _ Z_n^2 _  (u-z_k+w n ) _  (w n ) I_    _l_k S _  ,l_k^+,S _  SK, where  is the spin- representation of
 Sklyanin algebra  with dimension
. The corresponding
transfer matrices of the model are given by T_B(u;l_k)= tr_0 L_1(u;l_1)L_2(u;l_2)L_m(u;l_m). Then, our construction in Sect.3
actually results in the eigenvalues formulation ()
of the transfer matrices (), with the Bethe ansatz
equations (). In particular, our result recovers that of
 when .







The elliptic  Ruijsenaars-Schneider model  
 
If we take -module  for the special case W=V_^(l_1)  (z_1),   ^(l_1) =l_1_1=N_1=nl_1,
the zero-weight space of this module is one-dimensional and
the associated transfer matrices  can be  given by
 T(u)=(u-z_1+lw) (u-z_1+nlw) M. The operator 
is independent of  and is given by M=_i=1 ^n
_ji (_ij w+lw) (_ij w) _i. Here  are elementary difference operators:
. In fact, for a special choice of the
parameters, this difference operator  is  the
Hamiltonian of elliptic  type Ruijsenaars-Schneider model
  with the special coupling
constant  , up to conjugation by a function
. Now, we consider the spectrum of . The results of Sect.
3, enable us to obtain the spectrum of the Hamiltonian of the
elliptic  Ruijsenaars-Schneider model as well as the
eigenfunctions, in terms of  the associated transfer matrices 
(). Since  is independent of ,  we can evaluate the
eigenvalue of  at a special value of , . Then the
expression of the eigenvalue  simplifies
drastically, for the second term in the right hand side of
() (the one depending on the eigenvalue of the
reduced transfer matrices ) vanishes
because  in the case (). Finally, we  obtain
the eigenvalues of : e^(1-n)w (nlw) (lw) _k=1 ^(n-1)l  (v_k-z_1-nlw +2w)  (v_k-z_1-nlw +w)  , where
 and  are determined by the nested
Bethe ansatz equations &&e^(i-n)^(i)  w  
_k=1,ks ^N_i+1  (v^(i) _k-v^(i) _s+w) (v^(i) _k-v^(i) _s-w) =

_k=1 ^N_i (v^(i) _s-p^(i) _k) (v^(i) _s-q^(i) _k) 
t^(i+1) (v^(i) _s;v^(i+1) _k),

&&        i=0,1,, n-2.The functions
 appearing in ()  are defined by the
following recurrence relations
&&t^(i) (u;v^(i) _k)= e^(i+1-n)^(i)  w 
_k=1 ^N_i+1  
(v^(i) _k-u+w) (v^(i) _k-u) 

&&+e^^(i)  w 
_k=1 ^N_i+1  (u-v^(i) _k+w) (u-v^(i) _k) 
_k=1 ^N_i (u-p^(i) _k) (u-q^(i) _k) 
t^(i+1) (u;v^(i+1) _k),

&&                                i=1,,n-2,

&&t^(n-1) (u)=1,
where ,  are
arbitrary complex numbers, ,  and
&&p^(0) _1=z_1,  q^(0) _1=z_1-nlw,

&&p^(i) _k=v^(i-1) _k,  q^(i) _k=v^(i-1) _k-w,  i=1,2,,
n-2,   k=1,2,,N_i .





Conclusions 
 
We have studied some modules over the elliptic quantum group
associated with  type root systems. There are elliptic
deformation of symmetric tensor product of the fundamental vector
representation of  (we have called it  higher spin
representation ). Using the nested Bethe ansatz method, we exactly
diagonalize the commuting transfer matrices associated with the
tensor product of the -modules with generic evaluation points.
The eigenvalues of the transfer matrices and associated Bethe
ansatz equation are given by () and ().
For the special case of , our result recovers that of Felder
et al.

We also take the applications of our construction to some
integrable models. For  case, our result gives
the spectrum problem of  Belavin model with periodic
boundary condition, which coincides with the result.
For the special case , our result gives the
spectrum problem of the elliptic  type  Ruijsenaars
operators, which is "relativistic" generalization of the
Calogero-Moser type integrable differential operators, with the
special coupling constant  . Furthermore, it will be
possible to construct the eigenvalues of all types of  Ruijsenaars
operators associated with the  root system  in the Bethe
ansatz form.

Appendix A: The commutation relations 
The starting point for deriving the commutation relations among
 and   is the
exchange relations () and (). We
rewrite  () in the component form
_i',j'=1 ^n R^a b _i'j' (u-v,L ^i' _c(u)
L ^j' _d(v)= _i',j'=1 ^n L ^b _j' (v)
L ^a _i' (u) R^i'j' _c d (u-v,).For , we obtain
(v)_i(u)&=&
1 R^i1 _i1 (u-v,1 -i )  _i(u)(v)-
R^1i _i1 (u-v,1 -i ) 
R^i1 _i1 (u-v,1 -i )  _i(v)(u)

&=&
1 R^i1 _i1 (u-v,)  _i(u)(v)-
R^1i _i1 (u-v,)  R^i1 _i1 (u-v,)  _i(v)(u),
by noting the definitions
() and ().
The commutation relation () is a simple consequence
of the above equation.

Similarly, for , we obtain ^j_i(u)_l(v)=_,
R^ _i l (u-v,) R^j1 _j1 (u-v,_ (v)^j_ (v)- R^j1 _1j (u-v,R^j1 _j1 (u-v,_i(u)^j_l(v), from which follows
the commutation relation (). For 
, we obtain &&_i(u)_j(v)=_,n _ (v)
_ (u)R^ _ij (u-v,)
=_,n R^ _ij (u-v, - )
_ (v)_ (u)

&&              =_,n R^ _ij (u-v,)
_ (v)_ (u),
    which leads to the commutation
relation (). The other commutation relations
()-() are derived from  ().
