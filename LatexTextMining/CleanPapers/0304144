Reducible representations of CAR and CCR are applied to second quantization of Dirac and Maxwell fields. The resulting field operators are indeed operators and not operator-valued distributions. Examples show that the formalism may lead to a finite quantum field theory.





Reducible representation of CAR 

The main objective of the paper is to discuss a reducible representation of canonical anticommutation relations (CAR) which generalizes to Dirac electrons the construction previously employed in to electromagnetic fields. 
The case of canonical commutation relations (CCR) is briefly discussed in the last section. 

Beginning with the CAR operators ,   of an irreducible  representation  we introduce the
following four operators 
 
satisfying a reducible representation of CAR. 
The momentum eigenvectors are normalized by 






.
The reducible representation of CAR can be written in a compact form as 
 
the remaining anti-commutators vanishing.
The identity 1 in () is the one
occuring in the CAR relations 

and the RHS of () is in the center of the CAR algebra. 
Similarly to  we 
have introduced the operator 



satisfying the resolution of unity 







We define the single-oscillator Dirac field operator by 
 
(x)=_sd _m(p)(
u(p,s) b(p,s)e^-ipx 
+
v(p,s) d(p,s)^ e^ipx 
).
In order to perform the second step of quantization we introduce 



where  is a Hermitian operator satisfying , 
. 
A fermionic -oscillator Jordan-Wigner-type extension is defined by 
 
b (p,s)
=
1 N  
_n=1 ^N 

I_0I_0 
_n-1    b(p,s)I I ^N 
=
 c _1(p,s),

 d (p,s)
=
1 N  
_n=1 ^N 

I_0I_0 
_n-1    d(p,s)I I ^N 
=
 c _2(p,s),

 (x)
=
_sd _m(p)(
u(p,s)  b (p,s)e^-ipx 
+
v(p,s)  d (p,s)^ e^ipx 
).
The reducible representation of CAR reads
 
 c _j(p,s), c _j' (p',s')^ 
=
_jj' _ss' __m (p,p')
 I _p ,

 I _p 
=1 N 
_n=1 ^N 

II 
_n-1   I_p I I ^N ,d _m(p)
I _p =I .
In order to verify that 
 is an operator it is sufficient to check this property for 
. 
The choice of the representation implies that 
 
(x)
=
_s(
u(p ,s) e^-ipx b_s
+
v(p ,s) e^ipx  d_s ^ 
)where 




is the spectral representation of the unbounded operator, 
and , 
are functions of the operator  in the sense of spectral theory.
All these objects are well defined and there is no problem with products of fields taken at the same point  of the configuration space. 
The difference between fields taken in our reducible representation and those arising from the standard irreducible one is analogous to this between the unitary operator 
 
and the distribution . Unitary representation of the Poincare group
 
is explicitly constructed in. The representation written in terms of Dirac fields reads (the superscripts  or  denote the parts of field operators containing only creation or annihilation operators, respectively) 
 
 S ^() _ (x-y)
def = 
i ^() _(x), ^() _(y)
=
1 N 
_n=1 ^N 

II 
_n-1   
S^() _ (x-y)
I I ^N 


S^() _ (x-y)
def = 
i^() _(x),^() _(y)
=
i(pm)_ e^ip(x-y) 1.
 
Neither anti-commutators nor products of fields evaluated at 
 lead to any difficulty. The essence of the new representation is in the replacement of ordinary integrals over momenta by spectral integrals (e.g.  regularization of zero-point energy in a finite volume takes the form ).   
The limit  provides a correspondence principle analogous to  or . For physical aspects of the modification cf..

Vacuum and multi-electron states 

The vacuum consists of a Hilbert space of all the states which are annihilated by all annihilation operators. We begin with a "single-oscillator vacuum" 
  
O=
d _m(p)O(p)p0,
 
where , i.e.  is the vacuum of the irreducible representation of CAR. The multi-oscillator vacuum is defined at 
the -oscillator level as the tensor product of one-oscillator vacua





As expected




Let us stress that the vacuum space  as a whole is Poincare invariant, whereas a concrete vector  is only covariant: The wave function transforms as a mass- scalar field which carries the unitary representation ; the exponent comes from the vacuum part of 4-momentum and can be removed by a unitary transformation. The vacuum space plays a role of a base space in a bundle whose fibers are Fock spaces generated in the usual way in terms of the representation of CAR. The structure of the fibers is characterized by a theorem on the thermodynamic limit  (the proof is exactly analogous to the bosonic case explained in detail in). 
Let






The scalar product of two unnormalized one-electron states is 
  
O c _j(f) c _j' (g)^ 
O =
_jj' _s d _m(p)Z(p)
f(p,s) g(p,s)
def = 
_jj' fg_Z 
where . 
The scalar product  reappears in the thermodynamic limit  for arbitrary multi-electron states.
 
Let 

. Then
  
_N 
O c _j(f_1)c _j(f_M)
c _j(g_1)^ c _j(g_M)^ O =
_ _f_1g_(1) _Z

f_Mg_(M) _Z

=
_ __s_1s_M 
d_m(p_1)d_m(p_M)


= 
Z(p_1)Z(p_M)f_1(p_1,s_1) 
f_m(p_M,s_M) 
g_(1) (p_1,s_1)

g_(m) (p_M,s_M) 
where  is the sign of the permutation .
Let us note that the weights 
 occur here automatically and regularize ultraviolet divergences since 




implies that  decays at infinity. Furthermore, the Poincare transformation  implies that 
 is a nonvanishing invariant. This allows us to introduce the cut-off functions , . Quantum electrodynamic regime is defined as a condition on supports of wave packets: . For any two such wave packets one finds 
 and the thermodynamic limit simply redefines a bare charge by a multiple of the invariant , as we shall see explicitly in the next section. 

Interaction Hamiltonian 

For Dirac electrons interacting with classical electromagnetic fields the departure point is the interaction-picture Hamiltonian 
 
Let us note that








where  is the 3-dimensional Fourier transform. The difference between  and  is a well behaved element of the center of CAR if the Fourier transform is not singular at . This shows that the Coulomb field leads to an infrared vacuum divergence. However, if one restricts  to solutions of free Maxwell equations then  since the origin of the light cone is excluded. We shall return to this question in the next section.

As a first purely fermionic modification consider the vacuum average
 
This is the usual-looking expression but with the cut-off function 
 and the "renormalization constant"  automatically built-in. 
The regularization by  is a straightforward consequence of reducibility: For irreducible representations one finds .

A first-order correction in a -matrix element evaluated between two single-electron wave packets reads 
 
S^(1) =
-ie_0
_s,s' 
d_m(p)d_m(p')


out S^(1) in = 
O I _p' 
I _pO  _modification 
(p',s') 
(p,s)u(p',s')_a u(p,s)
d^4x
e^i(p'-p)x  A^a(x).The underbraced expression, equal to 1 in the standard irreducible representation, is the only modification we encounter. Explicitly 
 
Keeping in mind that one power of  gets absorbed into normalization of single-electron states, assuming  we find, in the thermodynamic limit  and 
for wave packets satisfying the QED regime condition, that 
. For finite  there are additional corrections arising from the term proportional to . 

As a next exercise consider the vacuum polarization tensor which appears in second-order calculation of vacuum polarization. The standard expression is here replaced by 
 
Tr 
(
O S ^(-) (x_2-x_1)
^a
S ^(+) (x_1-x_2)^bO )

Tr  
=
-
Z N 
d_m(p)
(p)e^2ip (x_2-x_1) 
Tr 
((p-m)^a (p+m)^b)


Tr = 
-Z^2
(1-1 N )
d_m(p) d_m(p')

Tr == (p)(p')e^i(p+p')(x_2-x_1) 
Tr 
((p-m)^a (p'+m)^b).
The expression which survives the thermodynamic limit is a regularized version of the standard formula, multiplied by .

Reducible representation of CCR 

The automatic appearance of the cut-off functions  was a consequence of replacing at the RHS of CAR the identity operator by 
. The claim is that an analogous effect occurs for reducibly quantized electromagnetic fields. 

The strategy is similar to the CAR case. One starts with 
 
where  is an irreducible representation of CCR and then performs a bosonic -particle extension 
. The parameters  and  representing the numbers of fermionic and bosonic oscillators are in principle unrelated. A theorem analogous to Theorem 1 holds for the  limit. Coherent states of light are defined in the standard way in terms of a displacement operator 
 
D (f) = e^a (f)^ 
-a (f) ,a (f)=
_s d _0(k) f(k,s) 
a (k,s),

D (f)^ 
a (k,)
D (f)
=
a (k,)+f(k,)I _k .Let us note the important difference with respect to the irreducible representation: The shift in () is proportional to  and not to the identity operator. 
For  the statistics of excitations of a coherent state is Poissonian, as it should be for physical reasons. 
Now assume we have a classical transverse current  and the interaction-picture Hamiltonian 
 
where 
 is a reducibly quantized vector potential in a Lorenz gauge. 
A simple calculation shows that the  matrix, up to a unitary operator which belongs to the center of CCR, is given by the displacement operator and 
 
a (k,)_out 
=
S^ 
a (k,)_in 
S
=
a (k,)_in +j(k,)I _k 
=
D (j)^ 
a (k,)_in 
D (j)
where  are amplitudes of the two transverse components of the 4-dimensional Fourier transform of , restricted to the light cone, i.e. 
the same functions one finds in the standard formalism. But there is also a difference: The irreducible formalism would have produced 
 and not
. 

The vacuum space of the representation is constructed in analogy to the CAR case. 
One begins with





where , and 
the -oscillator extension is 





The "renormalization constant"  is a nonvanishing Poincare invariant and thus the cut-off function 
 is well defined. What is important, the field  is now massless and therefore vanishes not only at infinity but also at . 

Having the "out" fields we can compute their ("in"-)vacuum averages. The result is analogous to the standard one, but now the Fourier transform of the field involves the amplitude







 
and not  which would have occured in the irreducible formalism. The difference is subtle but of crucial importance since the property  can regularize the infrared divergence. In the irreducible case the radiation field produced by an accelerated pointlike charge involves the amplitude 
 which instead of vanishing blows up at . In the reducible case we obtain a regularization which eliminates the infrared divergence if the vacuum 
 is correctly chosen. The same concerns the average number of photons of the radiated field. Let us mention that the operators 
 appear also in reducibly quantized solutions of Maxwell equations with classical currents and thus regularize classical divergences. 

To conclude, the reducible representations seem to produce the cut-off functions in exactly those places one expects them to occur. This is a consequence of the RHS of CAR and CCR where instead of identities one finds  and . At the level of amplitudes and in thermodynamic limits one finds the effective rule , 
. The analogy to  renormalized fields(I am indebted to prof. H. Grosse for drawing my attention to this point during our discussion in Bialowieza 
whose CAR and CCR relations involve at RHS the renormalization constants  and  supplemented by cut-offs is probably not accidental. An argument in favor of our approach is that the RHS of CAR and CCR are Poincare covariant since 

, 

, which would not be possible if 
 and  were simply replaced in CAR and CCR by the functions 
 and
.
Our theory is nonlocal but in an unusual sense.

The above representations have a status of toy models. The main message we have tried to convey is that reducibility of some type may be crucial for a consistent QFT, a viewpoint advocated also by Dirac in his last paper. Generalizations to more abstract formalisms may be essential for the issue of gauge invariance, which is beyond our reach at the moment.  
In this context let us note the recent paper where a similar representation of CCR is discussed at the level of correlation-function approach to photons.
