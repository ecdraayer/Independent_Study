The unitarity of the NS  supersymmetric coset  is studied
for the discrete representations. The results are applied to the proof of the no-ghost theorem for
fermionic strings in  in the NS sector.
A no-ghost theorem is proved for states in flowed discrete representations. 








Introduction 
The purpose of this work is to study the unitarity of the
supersymmetric Euclidean  coset,
which is the simplest example of a nontrivial noncompact Kazama-Suzuki
model.
The coset is with respect to the timelike  current of
.
Our result  is a supersymmetric generalization
of similar results for the  bosonic coset, and
is relevant for several models.
We will use it here to fill a gap in the proof of the no-ghost
theorem for fermionic strings in .
We will also extend the proof to fermionic string excitations
belonging to the flowed sectors introduced in.

The bosonic coset  is a non-linear sigma model
whose target space geometry to first order in  is that of a 2D black hole.
In its supersymmetric version,  the 2D black hole metric
has been shown to describe the exact  conformal background up to four loops,
and has been argued to be exact to all orders.
Generalizing similar results for the bosonic case,
the supersymmetric coset has been argued
to be equivalent to certain matrix models and to  Liouville theory,
and is also relevant in relation to Little String Theories.



The unitarity challenges presented by  are very old





.
A  proof of the no-ghost theorem for bosonic strings
on  was given in, based on.
A different approach to unitarity for strings in  has been advocated in.

The relation between the  coset and string unitarity in 
comes from the fact that the proof of the no-ghost theoremshows that physical states built upon 
representations lie in the coset, modulo spurious states(As shown in Section 4, this statement does not hold
for states with  eigenvalue 0, which should be treated separately) .
This was shown in both for bosonic and  fermionic strings.
So string unitarity necessitates coset unitarity.
The latter was proved in for the bosonic coset, and we
will prove it for the supersymmetric case in the discrete representations.
It is worth noticing that both string and coset unitarity
rely on truncating the spin  of the discrete representations. This
restriction of  is rather ubiquitous, and we discuss it in Section 2.

The plan of this work is as follows. In Section 2 we review the basics
of string quantization in . In Section 3 we prove the unitarity of the coset. In Section 4 we review
the no-ghost theorem for unflowed string states in the discrete series and extend it
to the flowed sectors. Section 5 contains the conclusions.

In this work we will only deal with the Neveu-Schwarz sector. The Ramond sector can be treated along the same lines.

Fermionic strings in  and spectral flow 

The worldsheet theory is composed by a supersymmetric  WZW model at level  with central charge
cargasl 
c_SL(2,R) =3 + 6 k  + 32
 
and a supersymmetric unitary theory  with central charge .


The current algebra of supersymmetric  at level k is generated by six currents  ,
whose modes satisfy
comm 

[J^3_n, J^3_m ]    &= - k 2  n _n+m,0            [J^3_n, J^_m ]  &= J^_n+m            [J^+_n , J^-_m ]   &= -2J^3_n+m  + kn_n+m,0         [J^3_n, ^_m]&=^_n+m        [J^_n,^_m]&=2^3_n+m        [J^_n, ^3_m]&=^_n+m         ^3_n,^3_m &= -k 2  _n+m,0         ^+_n,^-_m &= k _n+m,0 ,
  
with all other (anti)commutators vanishing, and the same for the antiholomorphic sector.
The modding of  is integer and that of  half-integer (Neveu-Schwarz) or integer (Ramond).
As usual, purely bosonic currents can be defined by
bosonicJ 
 j^a &= J^a - J ^a         J ^a &= -i k  f^a_ bc  ^b ^c
  
The  form a  bosonic algebra at level .
The  and the  form a supersymmetric  algebra
at level  which commutes with . The spectrum
of the theory is the direct product of the Hilbert spaces of both theories.

The Sugawara stress tensor and the supercurrent are tensorT 
 T &=1 2k [j^+j^- +j^-j^+] - 1 k j^3j^3 -1
2k [^+ ^- + ^- ^+] +1
k ^3 ^3 G &=1 k  [^+j^- +
^-j^+] -2 k ^3j^3 - 2 k^2

& + 1 k _m=12  ^m(^+_-m 
^-_m + ^-_-m  ^+_m -2 ^3_-m  ^3_m)    The highest weight representations of  are built as a direct
product of representations of  and . For the 
currents, we have the usual representations for free fermions, for
both Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond sectors. For the NS sector, in which
we will be interested, we have a vacuum  annihilated
by  upon which the  states act.

For , we start from unitary representations  of
the  Lie algebra  . The representations are
characterized by the eigenvalues  of the Casimir operator

. The states within each representation are labelled by
the eigenvalue  of . The states  are
annihilated by , and the Fock space of states is
built by acting on them with .

The unitary representations of the  Lie algebra 
appearing in the spectrum of strings moving in an  background  are:

 
Highest weight discrete representations 

where  is annihilated by  and  is a  real number such that
.

Lowest weight discrete representations 

where  is annihilated by  and  is a  real number such that
.

Continuous representations 

where  and , where 
is a real number.

The  bounds for   appearing in  can be
understood in terms of consistency conditions for the primary
states. The lower bound, ,  is necessary for the
normalizability of the primary states when their norm is
interpreted as the  inner product of functions in the
 group manifold. As for the upper bound, 
,  it was noted in that it is necessary for
the unitarity of the primary states, when their norm is
interpreted as the two-point function of the vertex operators
creating them from the vacuum.

Moreover, adopting either the upper or the lower bound for , the other one
appears when imposing the  spectral flow (see below) to be a symmetry of the spectrum.
Finally, the compelling evidence for the correctness of these bounds on  comes from
the fact that only this range of  appears in the spectrum
of the thermal partition function of the model, computed by
path integral techniques in.


Now, given any integer , the algebra  is preserved by the spectral flow
, 
defined by
flow 

  J _n^3 & = J_n^3 - k 2  w _n,0    J _n^& = J_n w ^   _n^3 & = _n^3    _n^& = _n w ^   For , the symmetry  maps the 
representation into . But for generic , it
was shown in  that this symmetry maps regular
 representations to new representations which must be
included in a consistent quantization of strings in 
.

Note that the spectral flow was also performed on the fermions for consistency of the algebra.
The implications of this simultaneous flow for the boundary CFT theory have
been discussed in.
But the new sectors can be obtained by performing the flow only on the purely bosonic sector .
For the free fermions, it is easily seen to be a rearrangement
of the spectrum. In fact, for  a flowed NS vacuum can be defined by

while for  the  should be replaced by . In both cases the new vacuum satisfies


The flow  maps the modes of  and  to
tgflowed   L _n & =L_n + wJ^3_n -
k 4 w^2_n,0  G _r & =G_r + w^3_r   
Physical states will satisfy, in the  picture,
phys  (L_n 0 -1 2 _n,0 ) x=
G_n>0 x  The way to include the flowed representations
is to impose the physicality conditions , with  unflowed   and  , on  descendants built
upon  representations.

For generic , the mass shell condition can be
expressed as
shellmass 
-( -1) k  -wm + kw^2 4 + N + h - 1 2 =0
 
where   a highest weight
of the inner  theory and  the level  is a half-integer number.


Since the spin in the continuous representation of  is
 with  real, the mass shell
condition for unflowed strings is masslong  14 + z^2 
k  +N+h - 1 2 =0   which can only be satisfied for
. So string states in this sector will always be unitary
because the zero mode representation is. This does not hold for
flowed states in , which should be treated separately (see
Section 5).


Unitarity of  supersymmetric  



The states in the  module
can in general have negative norm because the currents  are timelike.
The states of the coset
are states  such that

In this section we will show that the coset states built upon
the   representations of the zero modes, have positive norm provided  and .
The proof is a generalization to the supersymmetric case of
 for the bosonic coset.

The no-ghost theorem requires unitarity of states annihilated by
 and . But if we were interested instead
in proving the unitarity of states annihilated by  and
 the result would follow immediately from that of
the bosonic case, due to the direct product structure. A simple
example of a state annihilated by  and 
but not by   is given by ejemplo 
x-1 j,t+1 2 ^+_-1/2 ^-_-1/2 j,t 




Moreover, only the condition imposed with  is
consistent with supersymmetry in the sense that if we require of
our state to be simultaneously a primary of the supercurrent ,
no further restrictions arise. If the conditions are imposed with
, it follows that the state should be also annihilated
by .

Before addressing the
unitarity issue itself, we should first discuss the quantum numbers
characterizing a state belonging to the supersymmetric  coset.
This is the major subtlety in generalizing the result of.

Consider the decompositions
decom 

J^3_0 & = j^3_0 + J ^3_0 L_0 & = L_0^b + L_0^f
  
where  and  are the zero modes of
tsepdef 

T^b &= 1 2k [j^+j^- +j^-j^+] - 1 k j^3j^3 T^f &=-1 2k [^+ ^- + ^- ^+]
+1 k ^3 ^3 ,
  
respectively, with .

Due to the direct product structure, a basis can be chosen for the  module
made up of states diagonal in   and .
The eigenvalues of  and  will be called  and , and the
levels of  and  will be denoted by     and .
Calling  and  the
eigenvalue of  and the level of ,   implies  and .

A state belonging to the coset can be assumed to have definite 
 and  quantum numbers, because the commutators
diago  [L_0,J^3_n] & =-nJ^3_n [L_0,^3_n] &
=-n^3_n [j^3_0,J^3_n]& =[j^3_0,^3_n] =0 [J ^3_0,J^3_n]& =[J ^3_0,^3_n] =0    imply that
 and  annihilate states with different
 or  separately.

On the other hand, a state in the coset will not in general have definite  and  quantum numbers,
because the nondiagonal commutators
nodiago 
[L_0^b,J^3_n]=-nj^3_n [L_0^f,J^3_n]=-nJ ^3_n
  
show that action of  and  will generally mix
states with different  and .
For example, rewriting the level  coset state  as
ejemplor 
x-1 j,t+(1 k +1 2 )^+_-1/2 ^-_-1/2 j,t 
it is clear that it has  and , but  and  are different for the two terms.

Let's call  to the maximum value of  appearing in the
terms of the expansion of a coset state. In  the same term will appear  as
the minimum value of . It is clear that the structure of the algebra implies that  and .



Let's see now that the norm of  is positive. Consider
level 
x L_0 x(-j(j-1) k  + N )xx 
We will use now the explicit form  of , but we write
the terms that come from  in  as coming from

whose zero mode is
zerojj 
(J_0^3)^2  -2J_0^3J ^3_0 + 2^_n=1 (J^3_-n J^3_n  -J ^3_-n J^3_n -J^3_-n J ^3_n )
 + 2 k _q=12  ^q(^+_-q  ^-_q + ^-_-q  ^+_q) ,
 
where we have used



The resulting expression for  is
 

Inserting this expression in  and
annihilating the modes  against
,   can be rearranged into
norma 
xxx[ _p=0 ^j^+_-p j^-_p + _p=1 ^j^-_-p j^+_p
+ ( 1-2 k  ) _q=12  ^q(^+_-q  ^-_q + ^-_-q  ^+_q)]x 
t(t-1)-j(j-1)+kN-s^2  
 

We will see that  is positive by showing that both the numerator and the denominator of  are
positive.

Let's consider first the denominator. When  it can be written as
denmayor 
t(t-1)-j(j-1) + kN^b_max  + (2N^f_min -s^2) + (k-2)N^f_min 
 
which is positive for . When , we rewrite it as
denmenor 
k(N^b_max +t-j) + (j-t)(j-t-1)+2(k/2+1-j)(j-t) + (2N^f_min -s^2) + (k-2)N^f_min 
 
which is also positive for  and . So the denominator is always positive.

Regarding the numerator, we proceed by induction on  and .
We assume that unitarity holds for states in
the coset module with level lower than , or  eigenvalue lower than .


Note that the numerator is the sum of norms of states
of the form  all of which
have level lower than , and  which has
level  but lower  eigenvalue.
But the norm of these states is not guaranteed to be positive by the induction hypothesis,
since, although they are still annihilated by , they are not necessarily annihilated by .

Now, let P  be the projection operator on highest weight
states of . Since every state of the theory can be obtained
by applying lowering operators  to highest weight
states, we have the completeness relation

J^3_n_2 J^3_n_1 + ...
  
Inserting this expression in norms like  and
 infinite

Commuting the  and annihilating them against  and , the above expressions
can be brought to

Note that the  factors are positive by the induction hypothesis. Using this
method, the numerator of  can be put into the form
sumado

where  and

efecomosuma 
f_r 1 (y)=_d=1 ^(-y)^d d!  _n_i>0 1 n_1...n_d   _n_1+n_2+...n_d,r 
 

It is clear that  will be positive if  and  are positive and .
In order to express  and  in a closed form, we first consider, following,
the generating function for 


generatriz 

f(y,z)= & _r=0 ^f_r(y)z^r = & 1 + _d=1 ^(-y)^d d!  _i=1 ^d ( _n_i=1 ^z^n_i  n_i ) = & _d=0 ^(-y)^d d!  [ -(1-z) ]^d = & (1-z)^y
  

Now  can be obtained by derivation to find


efechico 

f_1(y) & =-y, f_r>1 (y) & = - y r (1-y)(1- y 2 )...(1-y r-1 )
  


and from  we obtain  and

efegrande 
F_p 1 (y) =(1-y)(1- y 2 )...(1-y p )
 


which is positive for . Regarding  we see from  and  that

H_1 2 (y) & = 1/2 H_3 2 (y) & = 3 2 F_1(y) + y H_q>3 2  (y) &  = qF_q-1 2   + y + y(1-y)+...+y(1-y)(1- y 2 )...(1-y q-3 2  )
  

so that  is also positive for .
It follows then that  is positive for , that is, for .

No-ghost theorem for fermionic strings in the discrete series of the NS sector 

The no-ghost theorem guarantees that states satisfying the physicality conditions
 have positive norm.
For the fermionic string, it was shown in that physical states
belong to the supersymmetric  coset, modulo spurious states. To this statement
the result of Section 3 must be added. For the spectrally flowed representations of 
a proof was given in for the
bosonic case.





In Section 4.1, for the sake of completeness, we will review the proof of for
unflowed fermionic strings, and then
generalize it to the flowed case in Section 4.2. We
will work out the details of the 
representations, the  case being similar.



Unflowed states 
We define the subspace  of the Hilbert space as consisting of states 
which are primaries of  and , that is,
primaries 
J^3_nf^3_nf    n>0.
 


Notice that by the result of Section 3, states in  have positive norm. The proof has three steps.



Step 1 : If  is an orthogonal basis of  at level  and
 eigenvalue ,
the states of
the form
hilb 

 &  G_-1/2 ^_0  G_-a-1/2 ^_a 
L_-1 ^_1  L_-d ^_d  &    (^3_-1/2 )^_0  (^3_-b-1/2 )^_b  
(J^3_-1 )^_1  (J^3_-n )^_n  N,m,,
  

with  fixed and  varying, are linearly independent and
form a basis of the Hilbert space for states with level 
and  eigenvalue .


Proof :
Defining
TT 

T^3 & = -1 k  J^3J^3 - 1 k  ^3 ^3     G^3 & = -2 k  J^3 ^3,     

the fields  and  form a  supersymmetric timelike 
algebra.
We can further define
Tc 


L^c_n & =L_n-L_n^3   G^c_n & =G_n-G^3_n,
  


which, by construction, commute with  and .
Moreover,   and  form a c=9 
supersymmetric Virasoro algebra.
It is clear from ,  and , that  is
also a primary of , its
weight with respect to
 being,



pesomax 
h^c = - j(j-1) k  + N + m^2 k  + h, 

where , is the highest weight of the internal unitary
 CFT.


Using  we can put the states 
in one-to-one correspondence with states
hilbc 

&(G_-1/2 ^c)^_0  (G_-a-1/2 ^c)^_a 
(L_-1 ^c)^_1  (L_-d ^c)^_d      &    (^3_-1/2 )^_0  (^3_-b-1/2 )^_b  
(J^3_-1 )^_1  (J^3_-n )^_n  N,m,,
  
We want to show that for each , the states  are a basis for the whole
Hilbert space. Linear independence of the states  is equivalent to the
non-singularity of the determinant of their inner products. Since states built upon different
's or with different 
content are orthogonal, the determinant  factorizes into
Kac determinants of the  supersymmetric Virasoro algebra
with highest weight  and c =9.
These determinants in the NS sector are singular only for ,
so we need .
Since the structure of the algebra implies that , rewriting  as

pesomax2  
 h^c = (m-j)^2 k  + 2j k (N + m + 1/2 - j) + 2 N k (k 2  -j)+h,
 


we see that it is strictly positive if
 . Rewriting further  as
pesomax3 
h^c= 1 k [(j- k 2 )(k 2 +1-j)  + (m-k 2 )^2] + (N-j+m+1/2) +h
 


we see that  is also strictly positive for
, and linear independence follows.


In order to see that the states  generate the whole Hilbert space,
let's define as  the subspace of states with  level . For the states ,



Let's also define as  the subspace of  generated by states  such that .
We proceed now by induction on  as in.
For ,  is just formed by the representation  of the zero modes.

Let's assume the induction hypothesis for states with level lower
than . The linear independence argument above has shown that
there are no null states among the descendants  of states
in , that is, no states in  which are
orthogonal to all states in . It follows that
 is the direct sum of  and its orthogonal
complement.

Consider a state in the orthogonal complement of . From the induction hypothesis
that state is annihilated by  and , that is, it belongs
to . It follows that  where  are states in 
at level , i.e., the states  form a complete basis at each level  and each  eigenvalue
.


Step 2 : A physical state can be decomposed into the sum of two physical states,
one of them spurious and the other not.

Proof : A state is called spurious if it is a linear combination of states  with  or
.  Given a physical state expressed
in the basis , it can be written as a state with no   plus a spurious state. It can be checked
that the action of  on a spurious state leaves it
spurious provided  and . Moreover, the action
of  on states without  won't produce new .
Since  is a basis, it follows that both the spurious and the nonspurious states satisfy the
physicality conditions  separately.

Note that since the inner product of a physical and a spurious state vanishes we should only check
unitarity for the state with no .

Step 3 : A physical state  involving neither  nor  (when written as ), belongs to .


Proof : Using the decomposition  it is clear that  is annihilated by
  and . A sufficient condition under which  will also be annihilated by
  is that .

The reason is that when  the Hilbert space of
 acting on  has no null descendants,
because it has a negative highest weight , and
null descendants of a  NS supersymmetric Virasoro
algebra only appear for nonnegative highest weights .


Assuming the absence of null Virasoro descendants, the
 Hilbert space and that generated by
 will be the same(This follows by
simply counting the number of states at each level.) . So our
 state, which is a  descendent,
can be expressed as a  descendent. But being
annihilated by  and ,  can only
be the highest weight state, which is also annihilated by
.

The above argument does not hold for states with , and we
treat this case independently. Let's consider the appearance of
physical states with  for different values of . Remember
that the mass shell condition is mass  -j(j-1) k 
+N+h - 1 2 =0  

For    there are no states with  because  differs from  by integer values.

For  , Eq. implies that  or .
In the first case there are no states in  with .
In the second case, the only state is
uni 
^-_-1 2  j=1,m=1 
which is physical and belongs to .

For   since for  we have , the left hand side of  is
massa 
-j(j-1) k  +N+h - 1 2  -j(j-1) k  +k(j-1) k  +h
= (k-j)(j-1) k +h >0
 
because  implies , which is positive for .
Thus   cannot be satisfied either.

It follows that every physical state is annihilated by  and its
norm is positive by the result of Section 3.

Flowed states 

In this case, the states are built by the action of
 and  on , but
the physicality conditions  are still imposed with the unflowed operators   and .
Since we are considering the  series, we need only consider spectral flow with .

Step 1 : By the same arguments as before, we know that the states as those in , but written with
  form(Note that the conditions
 defining  can equivalently be imposed with either flowed or unflowed operators.) 
a basis
for states built upon . But replacing in  these operators with
replace 

J _n^3 & = J_n^3   _n^3 & = _n^3 L _n & =L_n + wJ^3_n  G _n & =G_n + w^3_n
  
for , they can be put in one to one correspondence with the states .
In other words, the states
, with , are a  basis for the Hilbert space built by 
upon .

Step 2 : It is the same.

Step 3 : The physicality conditions  for  again imply
that  and  annihilate it, and this in turn means that
also  annihilate  provided . 
Let's see that no states with  can appear in the flowed representations by
using the flowed mass shell condition ,
mf 
-( -1) k  -wm + kw^2 4 + N  + h - 1 2 =0
 

In the following we use that  implies that
.

For  the left hand side of  for  is
wunoa 
-( -1) k  + k 4 + N  + h - 1 2   >
N  + h - 1 2 
 
and using  the right hand side of  is
wunob 
 (-+ + 1/2) +- -1 + h = (-+ + 1/2) + + (k-2) 2  + h > 0
 
because  and , so that  is not satisfied.

For , the left hand side of  for  is
wdos 
-( -1) k  + kw^2 4 + N  + h - 1 2  >
k 4 (w^2 -1) -1 + N  + h  > 1 2 + N  + h > 0
 
because , so that  is not satisfied either.

Having seen that physical states are annihilated by , unitarity follows again from
the result of Section 3.





Conclusions 
We have proved the no-ghost theorem for the NS sector of discrete
representations
of fermionic strings
in . The result is relevant for
a whole family of vacua, such as those
yielding superconformal supersymmetry
in the boundary CFT theory.

For flowed fermionic strings in  representations,
the result of Section 4.2 can be easily generalized,
but then we should prove the
supersymmetric coset unitarity in the  sector.

The proof of the no-ghost theorem discussed above is a curved
space generalization of the proof for flat space in the old
covariant quantization scheme. On the other
hand, both for  and  for  representations, the
unitarity requirement for the supersymmetric coset can be bypassed
in the proof of the no-ghost theorem by using instead a BRST
quantization scheme. In that case one can rely upon the bosonic
coset unitarity by using the decomposition into  and 
currents . In any case, the unitarity of the
supersymmetric coset is relevant by itself, due to the wealth of
models based on it.
