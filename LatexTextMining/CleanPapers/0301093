Introduction 

The relativistic Dirac oscillator  proposed by Moshinsky-Szczepaniac
 is a
spin  object with the Hamiltonian which in the
non-relativistic limit  leads to that of a 3-dimensional isotropic oscillator
shifted by a constant term plus a  coupling
term for both signs of energy.
There they construct
a Dirac Hamiltonian, linear in the momentum  and position 
whose square leads to the ordinary harmonic oscillator in the
non-relativistic limit.
The Dirac oscillator have been investigated in several context
.


The R-deformed
Heisenberg algebra or Wigner-Heisenberg algebraic
technique was recently
super-realized for the SUSY isotonic oscillator
. The R-Heisenberg algebra has also been
investigated for the
three-dimensional non-canonical oscillator to generate a representation
of the  orthosympletic Lie superalgebra .

The R-Heisenberg algebra has been
found relevant  in the context of integrable models,
and the Calogero interaction .
Recently it has been employed for bosonization of supersymmetry
in quantum mechanics,
and the discrete space structure for the 3D Wigner quantum
oscillator has been investigated.
In this work, we obtain the complete energy spectrum for the Dirac
oscillator via R-deformed Heisenberg (RDH) algebra.


3D Wigner Oscillator 


In this Section, we provide a three dimension presentation of the
Wigner system with its bosonic sector to be the 3D isotropic oscillator
(assumed to be of spin-, to aid factorization).

The R-deformed Heisenberg (or Wigner-Heisenberg)
algebra is given by following (anti-)commutation relations (
 and 

 
where  is a real constant associated to the Wigner parameter
. Note that when  we have the
standard Heisenberg algebra.

It is straightforward, following the analogy with the Ref.,
to define
the super-realizations for the ladder operators 
 for 
taking the explicitly forms

 
which satisfy together with 
  all
the algebraic relations  of the RDH algebra with the constant 
replaced by  and 
Note that  commutes with all the
basic elements  and ) of the RDH algebra.

It may be observed that the RDH algebra that gets defined here
is in fact three
dimensional (one dimension for  and two for 
) and is identically satisfied on any arbitrary three
dimensional wave function.

On the eigenspaces of the operator ,
 the 3D Wigner algebra gets reduced to a 1D from with   
 replaced by its eigenvalue ,
 where  is the orbital angular momentum quantum
number. The eigenfuncitons of  for
the eigenvalues  and  are respectivaly given
by the well known spin-spherical harmonic 

Now, considering simultaneous eigenfuncitons of the mutually commuting
 and  by

 


 
(where the use of the subscript  indicates association with
], we observe that the positive semi-definite form of  the
ladder relations and the form of  dictat that
the ground state energy 
, where  indicates a
function of , is determined by the
annihilation condition which reads as
two cases.

The Dirac Oscillator Model 

Adding an "anomalous momentum" in the form of a (nonlocal)
linear and hermitian  interaction,




in the (noncovariant) Dirac free particle equation with
mass  and spin- in the natural sistem of units,

 
one obtains the equation for the Dirac oscillator :

 
where  and   are, respectively, the  mass of the  particle and the
frequency of the oscillator, and the  matrices 
satisfy the following properties:

 
Writing the Dirac spinor in terms of the upper and lower components,
respectively,  and ,




 the standard representation of the matrices

The Dirac oscillator via RDH algebra 

In this section, we implement a new realization of the Dirac oscillator
in terms  of elements of the R-deformed Heisenberg
algebra. To solve the equation Dirac,  following the usual
procedure, we consider the second order differential equation,

 
where  is a  second order Hamiltonian,




In the spherical polar coordinate system,
we obtain the non-relativistic form of the Hamiltonian Ui, for an
isotropic 3D SUSY harmonic oscillator with spin-

We consider a unitary operator
in terms of the radial projection of the spin,

 
to obtain the following relation between the transformed Dirac Hamiltonian,
  the 3D Wigner Hamiltonian,
 and the SUSY  Hamiltonian,
:

 

The energy spectrum of the Dirac oscillator 

The energy spectra of the operators  and 
are identical, since these operators are related by a unitary
 transformation. However, the relation between the principal
quantum number  and the angular momentum  is different, in
each case.  Obviously, the energy spectrum
associated with the two types of eigenspaces belonging to the eigenvalues
:

Case(i) 


 
where 

Case(ii) 








Conclusion 

In this work we investigate the
Dirac oscillator with the help of techniques
of super-realization of the R-deformed Heisenberg algebra.

The Dirac oscillator with different interactions has been treated by
Castanos et al.   and by Dixit et al. 
. These works
motivate the construction of a new linear Hamiltonian in terms of the
momentum, position and mass coordinates, through a set of seven  mutually
anticommuting 8x8-matrices yielding a representation of the Clifford
algebra . The seven elements of the Clifford algebra 
generate the three linear momentum components, the three position
coordinates components and the mass, and their squares are the 8x8-identity
matrix I 
Results of
our analysis on Dirac oscillator via  the Clifford algebra 
are in preparation.

In a forthcoming paper we show that the Dirac oscillator equation can be
resolved algebrically without having to transform it into a second order
diferential equation. Therefore, the important connection for the Dirac
3D-isotropic oscillator with the linear ladder operators of the R-deformed
Heisenberg algebra, satisfying the concomitant general oscillator quantum
rule of Wigner, have explicited in this work.
