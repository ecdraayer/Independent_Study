Recently it was conjectured by Gibbons and Townsend that the large  limit of
an  superconformal extension of the -particle Calogero model might provide a
microscopic description of the extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black hole near the horizon.
In this paper a possibility to construct an  invariant extension
of the Calogero model is considered. We treat in detail the two-particle case and
comment on some peculiarities intrinsic to  generalizations.

Keywords: Calogero model, black holes,  superconformal invariance






The Calogero model  has many interesting physical applications.
It provides a nontrivial example of -particle integrable
system in one dimension (see Ref.  for a review). Calogero-type models are
related to semisimple Lie algebras  and reveal an intriguing connection with
Hamiltonian reductions of the  Yang-Mills theory . Higher dimensional
generalizations appear in the context of fractional statistics and higher spin gauge theories . In quantum area the one-dimensional system
turns out to be completely solvable (see e.g. Ref.  and references therein).

Quite recently the -particle Calogero model has been brought to focus again, this time
in the context of black hole physics . It has been known for a long time that the -particle Calogero model with the Hamiltonian
calogero 
H=1 2  _i=1 ^n  p_i^2  +1 2   _i<j   g^2 (x_i-x_j) ^2 ,
where  is a dimensionless coupling constant, exhibits the conformal invariance. The charges
charges 
D=tH-1 2   _i=1 ^n  x_i p_i, K=t^2 H -t _i=1 ^n  x_i p_i +1 2  _i=1 ^n x_i x_i,
are conserved and together with the Hamiltonian () form the  algebra
H,D =H, H,K =2D, D,K =K,
which is the conformal algebra in one dimension. The conjecture  that the -particle
Calogero model might be relevant for a microscopic description of the extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black hole,
at least near the horizon, originated from the fact that the near horizon geometry for this case
has the  isometry group, the bosonic subgroup being . Taking into account that
the extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black hole can be viewed as the configuration of
four intersecting supergravity -branes wrapped on   and assuming that each of the supergravity
-branes can be interpreted as a large number of coinciding microscopic -branes ,
one comes to the conclusion that there must be an  invariant mechanics which governs the
fluctuation of the branes in the region of the intersection . Being conformally invariant, the
-particle Calogero system provides a possible candidate(In the context of black hole
physics the large  limit is to follow .)  for the bosonic part of such an
 superconformal mechanics.

In this brief note we discuss a possibility to construct an  superconformal extension of the
Calogero model. We treat in detail the two-particle case and comment on some peculiarities intrinsic
to  generalizations. Throughout the paper we choose to work in the Hamiltonian formalism.

As the first step one has to decide on the number of fermions to be assigned to each particle.
Because the system must accommodate an  supersymmetry and since in the one-particle limit
one expects to reproduce the  superconformal mechanics  it seems
natural to append a pair of complex fermions , ,
obeying the bracket , to each bosonic canonical pair
 and .
Let us mark the fermionic degrees of
freedom corresponding to each particle by the superscripts  and ,
respectively(In order to make the formulae more readable we loosely put the index 
on both  and  down. A more proper notation would be
,  .) .
Apart from the conformal generators , the  superalgebra includes two complex
supersymmetry charges  (their conjugates will be denoted by ), the superconformal partners
, and the -symmetry  generators 
(in the basis chosen the commutation relations of the  superalgebra are given in Appendix).
As the bracket , , makes part of the
superalgebra, the contributions to ,  which are linear in the fermions should be adjusted so as to
produce the Hamiltonian () (with  for the case at hand). This is typical of supersymmetric (quantum)
mechanics. Another important point to notice is a representation
of the  subalgebra. This is not unique and normally one chooses a "direct sum"
representation (in this respect see also Refs. ,)

the structure of the fermionic contributions in  and  is completely fixed by the latter relations
and the representation (). As to the bosonic coefficients in front of the fermions, the fact that
 is nilpotent suggests a passage to the center of mass and relative coordinates

finds the following representation for the  supersymmetry generators

Because the pairs  and  mutually commute, the conservation in time
of these generators is guaranteed by Jacobi identities.

To construct a representation for
the superconformal generators  one appeals to the
 superalgebra (see Appendix). It suffices to calculate the Poisson bracket of the
supersymmetry charges with the generator of special conformal transformations 
(see Eq. () above with  taken from Eq. ()) which gives

S_1=tG_1-1 2    (x_1-x_2) ^(1) _1

&&
S_2=tG_2+1 2    (x_1-x_2)  ^(1) _2
+1 2    (x_1+x_2)  ^(2) _2.
It is straightforward to check the the full algebra is closed (the commutation relations are gathered
in Appendix) and we conclude that the Hamiltonian () governs the dynamics of an
 invariant extension of the two-particle Calogero model. Notice that in the one-particle limit
(i.e. setting , , )
the system () reproduces the  superconformal mechanics of Ref. (with the parameters , ; see  for more details).
A few comments are in order.

i) Let us compare our result with the previous attempts , to construct an
 superconformal extension of the Calogero model. According to the analysis of
Ref.  for generic values of the coupling constant  and for  there is no way to build
an  invariant extension, while for  this can be done only for a particular value of the
coupling constant (see Ref.  for more details). As we have seen above, taking a more general ansatz
for the supersymmetry generators one can weaken the restriction on the coupling constant and construct a two-particle
model for generic values of the coupling constant(A passage to the center of mass and relative coordinates in the
Hamiltonian of the two-particle Calogero model brings it to the sum of a free particle and the conformal
mechanics , both admitting an  superconformal extension. Thus, the existence of an 
invariant extension of the two-particle Calogero model for an arbitrary value of the coupling constant
might be anticipated on this general ground. We thank Sergey Krivonos for pointing this out to us.) .
In Ref.  an -invariant model in two dimensions has been constructed without any restrictions
on the coupling constant or the number of particles. Since a naive dimensional reduction to one dimension does not
preserve all four supersymmetries it seems interesting to search for a more sophisticated reduction.

ii) Although we did not try to systematically extend our analysis to the  case, a preliminary consideration
shows that this may require a modification of the  representation ().
One such possibility is to mix fermions in the -generators so that the fermions belonging to
different particles share the same  spinor representation. For example, for the
three-particle case the generators
sumod 
&&
J_+ =1   [-i^(1) _1  ^(1) _2 -i ^(2) _1  ^(2) _2
-i^(3) _1  ^(3) _2+(^(1) _1  ^(2) _2+
^(2) _1  ^(1) _2+^(1) _1  ^(3) _2+^(3) _1  ^(1) _2+
.

+ ^(3) _1  ^(2) _2+^(2) _1  ^(3) _2)],


&&
J_- =1   [i^(1) _2  ^(1) _1 +i ^(2) _2  ^(2) _1
+i^(3) _2  ^(3) _1+ (^(2) _2  ^(1) _1+
^(1) _2  ^(2) _1+^(3) _2  ^(1) _1+^(1) _2  ^(3) _1+
.

&&
J_3=1 2  [^(1) _1  ^(1) _1 -^(1) _2  ^(1) _2+
^(2) _1  ^(2) _1 -^(2) _2  ^(2) _2+
^(3) _1  ^(3) _1 -^(3) _2  ^(3) _2
].
form the  algebra, provided , ,
the simplest solution being , .

iii) A representation of the  algebra constructed in this paper involves a central
charge which appears in the brackets of the supersymmetry generators with the superconformal ones
and is proportional to the (dimensionless) coupling constant  (see Appendix).
If one assumes that -particle -invariant model can be constructed along similar
lines, the central term is likely to have the form  (in this respect see also Ref. ).
Then, in order to preserve the algebraic structure, the large  limit is to be accompanied by
taking  to be small with  fixed.
