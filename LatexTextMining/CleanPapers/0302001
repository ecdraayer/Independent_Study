x^2+y^2 , the 
hyper-Kahler potential  becomes independent upon . 
Equation (1) was used by Ooguri and Vafa in their analysis of the 
matter hypermultiplet moduli space near a conifold singularity. The conifold 
singularity arises in the limit of the vanishing period, 

where the CY holomorphic 3-form  is integrated over a non-trivial 3-cycle 
 of CY. The powerful singularity theory  can then be 
applied to study the universal behaviour of the hypermultiplet moduli space  
near the conifold limit. 

In the context of the CY compactification of type IIA superstrings, the
coordinate  represents the 'size' of the CY cycle  or, 
equivalently, the action of the D-instanton originating from the Euclidean 
D2-brane wrapped about the cycle . The physical interpretation of 
the  coordinate is just the expectation value of another (RR-type) 
hypermultiplet scalar. The cycle  can be replaced by a sphere 
for our purposes, since the D2-branes only probe the overall size of 
, as in ref. .

The pre-potential  is periodic  in the RR-coordinate  since 
the D-brane charges are quantized. This periodicity should also be 
valid in curved spacetime. We normalize the corresponding period to be , 
as in ref. . The Euclidean D2-branes wrapped  times around the 
sphere  couple to the RR  expectation value on  and thus should 
produce the additive contributions to the pre-potential , with the factor 
of  each.

In the classical  hyper-Kahler limit, when both N=2 supergravity and 
all D-instanton contributions are suppressed, the pre-potential  of
a single matter hypermultiplet cannot depend upon  since there is no 
perturbative superstring state with a non-vanishing RR charge. Accordingly, 
the classical pre-potential  can only be the Green function of the 
two-dimensional Laplace operator, i.e. 

whose normalization is in agreement with ref. . 

The calculation of ref.  to determine the exact D-instanton 
contributions to the hyper-Kahler potential  is based on the idea 
 that the D-instantons should resolve the singularity of the 
classical hypermultiplet moduli space metric at . A similar situation 
arises in the standard (Seiberg-Witten) theory of a quantized N=2 vector 
multiplet (see, e.g., ref.  for a review).

Equation (2) formally defines the electrostatic potential  of electric 
charges of unit charge in the Euclidean upper half-plane , , 
which are distributed along the axis  in each point , 
while there are no two charges at the same point. A solution to 
eq. (2) obeying all these conditions is unique, 



After the Poisson resummation eq. (6) takes the singularity resolution form 
indeed,



where the modified Bessel function  of the 3rd kind has been introduced,


valid for all Re and  Re, while  is a constant.

By inserting the standard asymptotical expansion of the Bessel function  
near  into eq. (7) one finds








A dependence upon the string coupling constant  is easily
reintroduced into eq. (9) by a substitution .
The factors of  in eq. (9) are just the 
expected multi-D-instanton contributions. 

The OV pre-potential (6) has the form of the (regularized) T-sum over the
 T-duality transformations, , applied to the 'basic' solution 
 of eq. (2),


where  is a constant. The basic solution  is just the Green 
function of the three-dimensional Laplace operator  in eq. (2).

D-instantons in N=2 supergravity 

Any four-dimensional quaternionic manifold has the Einstein-Weyl geometry of 
 negative scalar curvature,

  
where  is the Weyl tensor,  is the Ricci tensor of the 
metric , and the constant  is proportional to the gravitational 
coupling constant.

It is the theorem that any  four-dimensional Einstein-Weyl
metric (of non-vanishing scalar curvature) with two linearly independent 
Killing vectors can be written down in the form 







in some local coordinates  inside an open region of the 
half-space , where  and  are the two Killing 
vectors, the one-forms  and  are given by


while the whole metric (12) is governed by the real function 
(= hypermultiplet pre-potential )  obeying a linear 
differential equation,



Equation (14) is thus a consequence of 4d, local N=2 supersymmetry and 
toric isometry. It is highly non-trivial that the linear  master equation 
(14) governs all -symmetric solutions to the highly 
non-linear  Einstein-Weyl system (11).

Equation (14) means that the quaternionic pre-potential  is a 
local eigenfunction (of the eigenvalue ) of the two-dimensional 
 Laplace-Beltrami operator 

on the hyperbolic plane  equipped with the metric 

  

The 'basic' -independent solutions to eq. (14) are given by

Their linear combination gives some perturbative contributions to the 
hypermultiplet pre-potential. The only -dependent 'basic' 
solution to eq. (14) is given by
A linear combination of those solutions with T-shifts  is known to
describe a generic multi-instanton quaternionic metric via eqs. (12) and 
(14).

The basic eigenfunction (17b) is simply related to the harmonic (outside the 
origin) function  (see the end of sect. 2),

This is an example of the general correspondence between the harmonic functions
 of homogeneity  in  and the -eigenfunctions  
in  of eigenvalue .

Applying T-duality (i.e. summing up over the orbit with respect to the 
T-transformation ) to the linear relation (18) yields



The quaternionic hypermultiplet potential , corresponding to the Ooguri-Vafa
 solution , is thus given by eq. (19). A general solution to 
eq. (19) reads 


with some function , and a constant . Substituting eq. (7) 
into eq. (20) and using the identities




we find




where we have redefined the integration function  and the 
renormalization parameter  as



In the perturbative region at large  the sum in eq. (22) represents the 
non-perturbative contributions with all D-instanton numbers, when  using the 
asymptotical expansion of the -function at , 


in full similarity to ref. . The first two terms in eq. (22) are
perturbative contributions that are to be -independent. Hence, the
function  is actually a constant, . Our final 
result for the D-instanton-corrected pre-potential of the matter hypermultiplet
 moduli space metric is thus given by



The logarithmic factor in the second term of eq. (25) is apparently to be 
interpreted as the N=2 superstring (one-loop) renormalization effect.

I am grateful to the referee of my paper in Nucl. Phys. B, whose 
remarks led me to this investigation.
