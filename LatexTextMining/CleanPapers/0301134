conserved operators are analyzed.
	





 Introduction 



	There are two approaches for introduction of conserved operator
quantities in quantum field theory. The first one is based on the Lagrangian
formalism and defines them via the first Noether theorem as conserved
operators corresponding to smooth transformations living invariant the action
integral of an investigated system; these are the canonical conserved
operators. The second set of conserved operators consists of generators of
some transformations of state vectors (and observables). Since these operators
are of pure mathematical origin, we call them mathematical conserved
quantities (operators). The present paper is devoted to a discussion of some
relations between the mentioned two kinds of conserved quantities in quantum
field theory. It is pointed that the two types of conserved operators are
generally different and may coincide on some subspace of the system's Hilbert
space of states.

	The present work generalizes part of the results
of  and may
be considered as a continuation of these papers.

	In what follows, we suppose that there is given a system of quantum
fields, described via field operators ,
,  over the 4dimensional Minkowski
spacetime  endowed with standard Lorentzian metric tensor
 with signature .
( 
The quantum fields should be regarded as operator-valued distributions
(acting on a relevant space of test functions) in the rigorous mathematical
setting of Lagrangian quantum field theory. This approach will be considered
elsewhere.
) 
The system's Hilbert space of
states is denoted by  and all considerations are in Heisenberg picture
of motion if the opposite is not stated explicitly. The Greek indices
 run from 0 to  and the Einstein's summation
convention is assumed over indices repeated on different levels. The
coordinates of a point  are denoted by ,
, ,
and the derivative with respect to
 is . The imaginary unit is denoted
by  and  and  stand for the Planck's constant (divided by
) and the velocity of light in vacuum, respectively.










Canonical conserved quantities 
	

	Suppose a system of classical  fields ,
, over the Minkowski spacetime , , is
described via a Lagrangian  depending on them and their first partial
derivatives ,
 being the (local) coordinates of ,  . Here and henceforth the Greek
indices  run from  to  and the Latin indices
 run from 1 to some integer . The equations of motion for
, known as the EulerLagrange equations , are
( 
In this paper the Einstein's summation convention over indices appearing twice
on different levels is assumed over the whole range of their values.
) 








and are derived from the variational principle of stationary action, known
as the action principle  (see, e.g, ,
,).

	The (first) Noether theorem  says
that, if the action's variation is invariant under  transformations
	 
		 
& xx^= x^(x)
x^_= x
(1) ,,^(s) )


& _i(x) _i^(x^)
_i^(x^)_= _i(x)
	
depending on  independent real parameters
, then the quantities ('Noether currents') 
	_() ^ (x)
:=
- ^i  
_i^(x^)  ^()   _ -
(__i(x))
x^   ^()   _	
- L(x) x^   ^()   _,
where  and 
	^i  := L (__i(x))  ,
are conserved in a sense that their divergences vanish,  
	__() ^ (x) = 0.
	Respectively, the quantities
	 	C_() (x) := 1 c  _() ^0 ^3x  ,

which in fact may depend only on , are conserved in a sense
that 
	C_() (x) x^0  = 0
	and hence . The functions (constants) 
are called canonical (Noetherian, dynamical) conserved quantities 
corresponding to the symmetry transformations 2.2new  of the system
considered.

	Let us turn now our attention to a system of quantum  fields
represented by field operators  ,
, acting on the system's Hilbert space  of
states and described via a Lagrangian
.
Supposed the system's action integral is invariant under the  
transformations 2.2new . As a consequence of that supposition, one may
expect the operators  2.2 , with  defined
via 2.3 , to be conserved, the equations 2.4  to be valid.
However, at this point two problems arise: (i) what is the meaning of the
derivatives in 2.3  as  is operator , not a
classical function? and (ii) in what order one should write the operators
compositions in 2.2 , shall we write
 or
?
Usually  these
problems are solved by (implicitly) adding to the theory additional
assumptions concerning the operator ordering in 2.2  and meaning of
derivatives with respect to operatorvalued arguments.
( 
E.g., derivatives like the ones in 2.3  are calculated according to the
rules of classical analysis of commuting variables by preserving the relative
order of all terms in the Lagrangian. As pointed
in , this rule corresponds to field variations
proportional to the identity mapping  of .
) 
In the work  we demonstrated that there is only
one problem connected with a suitable definition of derivatives relative to
operatorvalued arguments and all other results follow directly from
the (Schwinger's) action principle. The main point is that such derivatives
are mappings form (a subset of) the space  of operators on
 into  rather than operators . In
particular, we have
	 
For details and the rigorous definition of a derivative (of polynomial or
convergent power series) relative to operatorvalued argument, the
reader is referred to . Accepting 2.8 ,
we can write the quantum field analogue of 2.2 , the 'Noether's
current operators", as
	 
which immediately leads to the conservation laws 2.4  and 2.7 .
The quantities 2.6 , with  given by 2.9 ,
are called the canonical (Noetherian, dynamical) conserved operators 
corresponding to the symmetry transformations 2.2new .

	We end this section by the remark that the momentum, (total) angular
momentum, and charge conserved operators are generated respectively by 	the
transformation:
	 		 2 	& xx+b
&&
 _i(x)_i(x)

	&x^x^+ ^  x_&&
_i(x)_i(x)
  + 1 2  I_i ^j  ^  _j(x) + 
	& xx
&&
_i(x)^q c   _i(x) ,
		where , ,
and  are the parameters of the corresponding
transformations,  are the covariant coordinates of , the
numbers  characterize the behaviour of the
field operators under rotations, and the dots stand for higher order terms in
.







 On observer dependence of state vectors and observables 



	Let two observers  and  investigate one and the same system of
quantum fields. The quantities relative to  will be denoted as those
relative to  by adding a prime to their kernel symbols. The transition
 implies the changes
	 
(of the coordinates) of a spacetime point  and
	 
of a state vector  of system of quantum fields
.
( 
It is inessential for the following whether  () is an element (of
a representation) of the Poincare group or not; the former case is realized
when  and  are inertial observers.
) 
Requiring preservation of the scalar products in  under the change
, which physically corresponds to preservation of probability
amplitudes, we see that   is a
unitary  operator,
	 
where the dagger  denotes Hermitian conjugation (i.e., in mathematical
terms,  is the adjoint to  operator).

	 Let  be a dynamical variable and
 be the corresponding to it observable. The
change  entails . Supposing
preservation of the mean (expectation) values (and the matrix elements of
 (or )) in states with finite norm under the change
, we get
	 
As explained in  or
in , the field operators
 undergo more complicated change when one passes from  to
:
	 
where the depending on  matrix 
characterizes the transformation properties of any particular field (scale or vector one) under  and is such that
 is the identity matrix of relevant size.








 Transformations with Hermitian generators 



	Let , , be real independent
parameters and . Suppose the
changes 3.1  and 3.2  depend on  and
	 
where the operators 
are Hermitian,
	 
which ensures the validity of 3.3 , and the particular choice of the
constant  depends on what physical
interpretation of  one intends to get.

	Differentiating 3.4  and 3.5  with respect to
 and setting , we rewrite them in differential form
respectively as
	 
where



,




with  being the Kroneker deltas and the dots denoting higher
order terms in ,
and  is
the commutator of operators .

	In particular, to describe the quantum analogue of the
transformations 2.10 , in 4.1  we have to make respectively the
replacements:
	 		 4 	& ^b^&& x^x^b=x+b
&& -1
&& J _^m  P _ ^t  

	& ^^  (<)
&& x^  	x^  = x^+ ^  x_&& +1
&& J _^m  M _ ^r  

	& ^&& x^  x^= x
&& q c 
&& J _^m  Q ^p   ,
		so that

reduces to
 ,
 ), and
 , respectively.
The operators , ,
and  are the translation (mathematical) momentum
operator, total rotational (mathematical) angular momentum operator, and
constant phase transformation (mathematical) charge operator, respectively.
In these cases, the equations 4.4  are known as the Heisenberg
equations/relations for the operators
mentioned  . For that
reason, it is convenient to call 4.4 
Heisenberg equations/relations  (for the operators
) in the general case.

	The transformations 3.1  and 3.5 , defined by the
choice 4.1 , are the quantum  observertransformation
version of 2.2new . For that reason, one can expect the (spacetime
constant) operators  to play, in some sense, a
role similar to the conserved operators 2.9 ; we shall call
 mathematical conserved operators 
corresponding to the transformations 3.1  and 3.5  under the
choices 4.1 .

	Suppose there exist operators , where
QM stands for quantum mechanics
( 
This notation reminds only some analogy with quantum mechanics. If one
identifies  with the Hilbert space of this theory and makes some other
assumptions, (part of) the generators  will
coincide with similar objects in quantum mechanics. However, as the Hilbert
spaces of quantum field theory and quantum mechanics are different, the
corresponding operators in these theories cannot be identified. See similar
remarks in concerning the momentum and angular momentum operators, respectively.
) ,
generating the change , such that (
is the absolute value of )
	 
Note that  (as well as
) may depend on ; for instance, the changes
 defined via 4.5a -4.5c  entail 4.6 
with respectively ( is the identity mapping of )
	 		 
	
	The transformation 4.6  implies the changes
	 
which, in differential form, entail
	 
Comparing these equations with 4.3  and 4.4 , we find
	 		 
	where   is the sign of
. If we admit 4.12a  to hold for
every  , the Schur's lemma
( 
See, e.g, ,,
.
) 
implies
	 
where  are real numbers (with the same dimension as the eigenvalues
of ).









 Discussion 



	Following the opinion established in the literature
( 
See also the
papers  in
which the momentum and angular momentum are analyzed.
) ,
the identification
	 
may seem 'natural' prima facie  but, generally, it is unacceptable as
its l.h.s. comes out from the Lagrangian formalism (via 2.9 
and 2.6 ), while its r.h.s. originates from pure mathematical
(geometrical) considerations and is suitable for the axiomatic quantum field
theory .

	As an equality weaker than 5.1 , the Heisenberg
relations 4.4  with  for 
can be assumed:
	 
However, these equations as well as 5.1  are external to the Lagrangian
formalism by means of which the canonical conserved operators are defined. As
discussed in  on particular examples, the
validity of the equations 5.2  should be checked for any particular
Lagrangian and they express (in the sense explained in loc. cit. ) the
relativistic covariance of the Lagrangian quantum field theory.

	Generally the equation 4.3  with  for
, viz.
	 
cannot hold; a counterexample being the choice of  and
 as the momentum and angular momentum operators (or vice
versa ). If 5.3  happens to be valid for operators  forming
an irreducible representation of some group, then, by virtue of 5.3 
and 4.3 , the Schur's lemma implies
	 
for some real numbers  (see also 4.13 ).

	Let a vector  represents a state of the system of
quantum fields considered. It is a spacetimeconstant vector as we are
working in Heisenberg picture of motion. Consequently, we have
 which, when combined with 4.6 , entails
	 
So, applying 4.13  to , we get
	 
If one intends to interpret  as the conserved
canonical operators  (see the possible equality 5.1 ),
then one should interpret  as the mean (expectation) value of
, which will be the case if
	 
(Notice, 5.7  and 5.4  are compatible iff .) The
equations 5.6  and 5.7  imply
	 
where
	 
Generally the set  is a proper subset of  and
hence 5.8  is weaker than 5.1 ; if a basis of  can be
formed from vectors in , then 5.8  and 5.1  will be
equivalent. But, in the general case, equations 5.2  and 4.4 
lead only to
	 
but not to 5.1 .

	Ending this section, we note that the equality
 is unacceptable as, in view
of 5.5 , it leads to identically vanishing eigenvalues of
.








 Conclusion 



	In this work we have analyzed two types of conserved operator
quantities in quantum field theory, the ones arising from the (first)
Noether theorem in the framework of Lagrangian formalism and conserved
operators having pure mathematical origin as generators of some
transformations (and having natural place in the axiomatic approach). These
operators are generally different and their equality is a problem which is
external to the Lagrangian formalism and may be considered as possible
subsidiary restrictions to it. However, using the arbitrariness 4.13 
in the mathematical conserved operators, both types of conserved operators
can be chosen to coincide on the set 5.9 . As weaker conditions
additionally imposed on the Lagrangian formalism, one can require the
equality 5.10  between the commutators of the field operators and
conserved operators. As it is known , the Heisenberg
relations 5.2  are equations relative to the field operators,
while 4.4  are identities with respect to them.
