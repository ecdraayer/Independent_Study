A small comment on the paper with the mentioned title by Carl M. Bender, Dorje C. Brody and Hugh F. Jones.

 





As argued in, the eigenfunctions  of the Sturm-Liouville
eigenvalue problem  are fixed up to a constant phase factor.  
Instead of , one can also choose
 
to be the eigenfunctions under considerations, which satisfy 
 
and 
 
This formula, then, looks more familiar than . Only if the functions
 are non-real, one usually has a different formula:
.
The operator  can be represented by
 
It acts on the functions  as , so that they
are invariant under :
 
and are orthonormal under
 
which looks like a real  inner product
(i.e.   instead of 
) . 
So we see that -invariance of a Hamiltonian, as introduced in,
is equivalent with the
existence of a set of eigenfunctions that are complete and orthonormal under a
real  inner product.  The (complex) inner product in the whole Hilbert
space can be defined by
