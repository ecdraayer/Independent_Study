It is shown how to solve the Euclidean equations of motion of a point particle in a general potential and in the presence 
of a four-Fermi term. The classical action in this theory depends explicitly on a set of four fermionic collective 
coordinates. The corrections to the classical action due to the presence of fermions are of topological nature in 
the sense that they depend only on the values of the fields at the boundary points . As an 
application, the Sine-Gordon model with a four-Fermi term is solved explicitly and the corrections to the classical action 
are computed.    
Introduction 
It is well-known that the equations of motion for a point particle in Euclidean space moving under the influence of a 
Minkowski potential possessing at least two degenerate minima, admit finite action solutions which are the instantons. 
Their existence
is responsible for tunnelling processes in the Minkowski space. The symmetries of the action are reflected in the space of 
instanton solutions.
Local deformations of these solutions in the directions determined by the symmetries give rise to zero modes in the 
semiclassical expansion. To avoid infinities in the path integral due to these zero modes one is forced to introduce 
collective coordinates. 
In the presence of rigid supersymmetry the above solutions are still instantons provided that the fermions vanish 
. Applying the rigid 
supersymmetry transformation rules on these instantons one determines a more complete set of instantons where the fermions 
no longer vanish 
but instead they depend linearly on Grassmann collective coordinates. The number of Grassmann collective coordinates is equal to
the number of the Fermi fields present. Since the new instantons are related to the previous ones by supersymmetry, the 
classical action remains the same. 
It is possible to break supersymmetry through the introduction of a four-Fermi term. 
The new equations of motion
can be solved iteratively starting with the instanton solution in the supersymmetric case. The iterative process terminates
due to the nature of Grassmann collective coordinates so in this way it is possible to obtain exact solutions to the new 
equations of motion. Since there is no symmetry involved
in obtaining these solutions the instanton action will change. The correction is the integral of a total derivative term,
so it depends only on the boundary values of the fields. It depends also on the Grassmann collective coordinates introduced 
by supersymmetry. Note that the fermionic fields become infinite as  while it is possible 
to keep the bosonic field finite by appropriate choice of the integration constants. Nevertheless, despite this infinity,
the action remains finite. 
As an explicit example we consider the quantum mechanical Sine-Gordon potential with a four-Fermi term. The iterative
solution of the equations of motion is demonstrated explicitly determining in this way the instantons. The integration 
constant that renders the bosonic field finite is determined. In this case the instanton action
becomes  where  are coupling 
constants.
Finally, we solve the equations of motion for a general potential in terms of 
the bosonic part of the instanton when the Fermi field is zero, which is used as a new variable instead of . 
It is interesting that in order to 
compute the action corrections it is not necessary to solve the nonlinear BPS equation.
 In fact it is possible to express completely both the instanton and the finite boson integration 
constant in terms of the new variable.          




The Quantum Mechanical Model 

We start by considering the following one dimensional quantum mechanical model in Euclidean space:
S_cl = -1 2 _- ^ [ (x ())^2 + U^2(x)]d. 
 The potential  of the equivalent particle is asumed to have a 
number of degenerate minima. 
The equation of motion is
x -U(x)U^ (x)=0.

The instanton solution of this equation satisfies the BPS equation
x _in +U(x_in )=0
subject to the conditions  where .
The action is invariant under time translations which implies that if  is a solution to the BPS equation then 
 is also a solution. This means that
 
Z _0(x _in (- _0)=- d d_0 x_in (-_0)
is a zero mode of the operator corresponding to the quadratic variation of the action around . It
satisfies the equation 
Z  _0(+ U^ (x_in )Z _0(- _0)= 0. 
Note that the normalization of  defined as  is just the absolute value of the classical action. 
This is so because
S_cl =-_- ^ (x _in )^2 d- ^ Z _0^2 dwhere we use the BPS equation. So it is reasonable to define the normalised zero mode as follows
Z_0=S_cl ^-1/2 Z _0. 
It is possible to introduce fermions into this model by adding the terms
S_2f =-1 2 _- ^ [ _i ^T  _i
+ (_i ^T _2 _i)U^  ]d. 

where ,  are two component Majorana fermions 
and the fermionic index is a colour index 
ranging in . 
Each fermion is related to a boson through rigid  supersymmetry realised by the transformations
x = ^T _2 ; = _2 x -U .

The spinor  can be expanded in terms of the eigenstates 
 of 
 as follows
1 2  ( _+ _+ + _- _- )

and then it can be proved that if  then 
x=0; _+ Z_0 ().
Starting from the configuration ,  and integrating over the above supersymmetry transformations 
we arrive at the instanton given by  and
_i^(1) =_i  Z_0(
To each colour index we associate the same bosonic zero mode but different Grasmannian collective coordinates .
Following we add to the action a four Fermi term which breaks supersymmetry 
S_4f =g 4  _- ^  _ijkl (_i ^T _1 _j)(_k ^T _1 _l)dwhere . The new field equations are now
x  - U U^ &=& 1 2 (_i^T _2 _i)U^  

 _i + _2 _i U^  &=& g_ijkl _1 _j (_k^T _1 _l).
Expanding  w.r.t the GCC one has . Note that all the other terms in 
the expansion vanish. Making the ansatz
_i^(3) =()_ijkl _j _k _l _-,

and plugging it into the fermionic field equation (15) one gets
 -U^ =-g Z_0^3.
Since the solution of the homogeneous equation is  it is natural to set 
()=Z_0^-1 y().
This leads to the equation
y ()=-g Z_0^4.
Similarly we can expand  and plug this into the bosonic field equation which gives
x ^(4) -x^(4) (UU^ +U^2 )(x_in )=-^4 Z_0 ()U^ (x_in ).
The solution of the homogeneous equation is  so it is natural to set 
 where  satisfies
d d (Z_0^2  )= -y()Z_0()U^ (x_in ) 
and . 
It is interesting to compute the corrections to the classical action due to  and . The two
Fermi term gives
S_2f  &=& -1 2 _- ^  [ _i^T(1)  _i^(3)  +_i^T(3)  _i^(1)  
+ (_i^T(1) _2 _i^(3) +_i^T(3) _2 _i^(1) )
U^ (x_in ) ]

&=& -1 2 _- ^  [_i^T(3) ( _i^(1) +_2 _i^(1) U^ )+
_i^T(1) ( _i^(3) +_2 _i^(3) U^ )] 

&=& -1 2 ( ^4 ) _- ^  y  d
=-1 2 ( ^4 ) (y()-y(-) )

and the four Fermi term 
S_4f =g 4 _- ^ _ijkl  (_i^T(1) _1 _j^(1) ) 
(_k^T(1) _1 _l^(1) )=1 4 ( ^4 ) (y()-y(-) ). 

One easily checks that . 
The bosonic correction gives
S_bc &=& -_- ^ [x _in x ^(4) + x^(4) U(x_in )U^ (x_in ) ] 

&=& -_- ^ d d (x^(4) x _in )d=-^4 S_cl   (_ (Z_0^2()())
- _- (Z_0^2()())). 
It is worth noting that if the bosonic field is finite as  then 
 is finite and since 

the bosonic correction vanishes.

The Sine-Gordon model 

For the Sine-Gordon model the action is
S^SG _cl =-1 2 _- ^ [x ^2 + 2m^4   
(1-(  m x)) ] d. 
Here 
U(x)=2m^2   (  2m x).
The BPS equation takes the form 
x _in +2m^2     2m x_in  =0
and can be easily solved to give 

x_in ()=4m   ^-1 e^-m(The minus sign corresponds to the instanton solution and the plus sign to the anti-instanton.  
In what follows we are going to work with the instanton.  
The zero mode corresponding to the instanton is 
Z _0()=dx_in  d =2m^2   1 cosh(m(
and the classical action becomes 
S_cl =-_- ^ Z _0^2d=-8m^3  

So 
Z_0=m 2  1 cosh(m(- _0)) .
Upon introducing the two and four Fermi terms given in the previous section, we get that the fermionic field is 
 where  is given by zeroi  and  is given by ansatz .
The function  is the solution of the equation 

y ()=-gZ_0^4()=-gm^2 4 1 cosh^4(m(
This can be solved by setting .  With this change of variable the solution is written as
y(z)=-gm 4 (a+z-1 3 z^3)

and thus 
^(3) _i=-g 2 m 2  1 1-z^2  (a+z-1 3 z^3)_ijkl _j_k_l
_-.
To determine the form of  we solve the bosonic field equation betaeq . In terms of the new variable z
this equation becomes
d dz (d dz  Z_0^4() )=1 4  2m  y().
This gives 
d dz =-1 4 g m  2m   (A (1-z^2)^2  
+ z (1-z^2)^2 + z^2 2(1-z^2)^2  - z^4 12(1-z^2)^2  ).
The solution to this equation is
(z)= 1 4  g m   2m   [ (A 2 +5 24 ) 
z z^2 -1  - (A 4 -1 16  ) (z+1 1-z  ) + 1 12 z
+ 1 2   z^2 -1  +B ] 
The contribution to the two and four Fermi terms is
S_2f +S_4f =1 2 S_2f =^4 gm 12 .
The bosonic correction is
S_bc =-^4 1 4 gm (A +5 12  ).
If the bosonic field is bounded at infinity then  vanishes and this implies that . In this
case the full action is
S_tot =-8m^3  +^4 gm 12 .
Generalisation 

It is worth mentioning that it is possible to solve exactly the equations eqy , betaeq  if we change variables
from  to . This is so because . Applying this change of variable to eqy 
we get
  
dy dx_in  =-g S_cl   Z_0^3=g S_cl ^2 U^3(x_in )
where . This admits the solution 
y=g m   +g S_cl ^2 U^3(x_in ) dx_in .
The integration constant  has been chosen to be dimensionless. Similarly equation betaeq  becomes
 
d dx_in  ( d dx_in   U^3(x_in ))= S_cl   y(x_in ) U^ (x_in ).
Integrating once this equation and using eqy1  we get
d dx_in  =S_cl   y(x_in )U^ (x_in ) U^3(x_in ) -g 4  S_cl ^-3 2  
U(x_in )+ gm^2 S_cl   A  1 U^3(x_in ) .
Integrating again we get
(x_in )&=& -1 2 S_cl ^-3 2  1 
U^2(x_in )  (gm S_cl ^2   +g U^3(x_in ) dx_in  ) 
+1 4  g S_cl ^-3 2  U(x_in )dx_in  

&+& g m^2 S_cl ^1 2  A  1 U^3(x_in )  dx_in  + g S_cl ^-1 2   B . 
Recall now that as ,  where . Demanding that 
the bosonic field correction is finite we get that  
is finite,
so  . This translates into the conditions
  
g m^2 S_cl ^1 2  A  _x_in C_+  (U^2(x_in )_x_0 ^x_in   1 U^3(s) ds 
) -
g 2 S_cl ^-3 2   _x_0 ^C_+ U^3(s) ds =1 2    g m S_cl ^1 2  

g m^2 S_cl ^1 2  A  _x_in C_-  (U^2(x_in )_x_0 ^x_in   1 U^3(s) ds 
) -
g 2 S_cl ^-3 2   _x_0 ^C_- U^3(s) ds =1 2    g m S_cl ^1 2    
where the value of  is determined by the choice of . Subtracting the two equations we arrive at
A =1 2 m^2 S_cl ^-2  _C_- ^C_+  U^3(s) ds (_x_in C_+  
- _x_in  C_-  ) (U^2(x_in ) _x_0 ^x_in  1 U^3(s) ds ) .
These formulae have been checked in the cases of the double well and the Sine-Gordon potentials. For the double well 
potential the results agree with those of provided that we redefine our integration constants appropriately. 
In the case of the Sine-Gordon model the results agree with those of the previous section under the following 
identification of the integration constants
 
A =1 16 -A 4 ;  = 4 ; B =B 2 .


Conclusion  
We have determined the corrections to the supersymmetric instanton, for a point particle in a general potential 
that admits at least two 
degenerate minima, due to the presence of a supesymmetry breaking four-Fermi term. 
Starting from the instanton solution of the 
supersymmetric case and applying an iterative procedure we obtain exact solution of the new equations of motion. There is 
no symmetry involved in obtaining these solutions so the classical action will receive corrections. 
If we demand that the bosonic field remains finite as  then only the two- and four-fermion 
terms contribute 
corrections to the classical action. The fermionic fields diverge as  nevertheless their 
corrections to the action remain finite. In the case of the Sine-Gordon potential  
the classical action gets modified by the contribution 
 where the  are fermionic collective coordinates. 
Finally, by a suitable change of variables, 
we determine the corrections to the classical action for a general potential and we
compute the integration constant  that makes the bosonic field finite
when  in terms of the potential only.
