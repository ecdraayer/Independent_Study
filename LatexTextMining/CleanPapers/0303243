Abstract 
 
When M-theory is compactified on -holonomy manifolds
with conical singularities, charged chiral fermions are present
and the low-energy four-dimensional theory is potentially 
anomalous. We reconsider the issue of anomaly cancellation, 
first studied by Witten. We propose a mechanism that provides
local cancellation of all gauge and mixed gauge-gravitational
anomalies, i.e. separately for each conical singularity. It is 
similar in spirit to the one used to cancel the normal bundle
anomaly in the presence of five-branes. It involves smoothly 
cutting off all fields close to the conical singularities,
resulting in an anomalous variation of the 3-form 
and of the non-abelian gauge fields present if there 
are also  singularities. 













Introduction 

M-theory compactified on a smooth 7-manifold  of 
-holonomy gives rise
to four-dimensional  supergravity 
coupled to 
abelian vector multiplets and  neutral 
chiral multiplets
. The theory contains no charged chiral 
fermions and there are no non-abelian
gauge symmetries. Both phenomena are generated when 
 possesses
conical and -singularities. 
In this case the
low-energy four-dimensional theory is potentially 
anomalous, but it
was argued in ref. that all anomalies 
cancel against
various "inflow" terms.

The basic examples of conical singularities are taken from
the asymptotics of the well-known non -compact 
-manifolds
. Of course, Joyce's construction 
 gives compact
-manifolds, but no explicit example with conical 
singularities is known.

On the other hand, there are generalisations of 
-holonomy manifolds which naturally
are compact and have conical singularities. 
Mathematically they have so-called weak -holonomy,
and in many cases we can write down the metric explicitly
.
Physically, they correspond to turning on a background 
value for the supergravity four-form field strength ,
thus creating a non-vanishing energy-momentum tensor 
which increases the curvature of  and makes it compact. 
When done appropriately one still has  
supergravity, but now in . Doing quantum
field theory, in particular loop calculations in  
spaces is highly non-trivial, but one can still study 
anomalies and their cancellation, since they are 
topological in nature. 

The aim of this note is to reconsider the anomaly cancellation
mechanism for singular -manifolds
outlined in, but insisting on local 
cancellation, i.e. 
separately for each conical singularity. In
particular, one has to be careful about the correct
interpretation when using Stoke's theorem to rewrite 
bulk integrals as a sum of boundary terms. This
is a general feature of anomaly cancellation through inflow
from the bulk as soon as one has several "boundary" 
components.
We show how local anomaly cancellation can be properly 
achieved by appropriate modifications of certain 
low energy effective interactions like e.g. the Chern-Simons 
and the Green-Schwarz terms of eleven-dimensional 
supergravity, much in the same 
way as required for the cancellation of the normal bundle 
anomaly in the presence of five-branes. The
basic feature of these modifications is to smoothly
cut off all the fields when a conical 
singularity is approached. 
If there are ADE singularities which generate 
non-abelian gauge fields, this cut-off procedure
induces corresponding modifications of the additional
interactions present in this case. To study the
mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies we also cut off the 
fluctuations of the geometry. Since we 
study quantum theory in a given background, only 
the fluctuations around this background are cut 
off, not the background itself.  In any case, the 
relevant interactions  then naturally split 
into a "bulk" part  and a sum of terms 
 localised at the various singularities 
. While the   are invariant, 
the variation of each  cancels the 
corresponding anomaly at  locally.
This method to achieve local cancellation is rather 
general and powerful. Exactly the same 
mechanism can also be applied to discuss local
anomaly cancellation 
on weak -holonomy manifolds with conical singularities
as constructed in.


This paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we review the
geometrical setup and the anomalies due to the chiral fermions
present at the singularities. We remind the reader 
how global anomaly cancellation was shown in and
explain why local cancellation still remained to be proven.
In section 3, we introduce our procedure of cutting off the 
fields close to the singularities and show how this leads to 
local  cancellation of the gauge anomaly in the
abelian case. We also give a preliminary discussion 
of the cancellation of the mixed gauge-gravitational 
anomaly. Section 4 deals with the non-abelian case where 
the cut-off procedure is more complicated due to the 
non-linearities. We show how the  and 
mixed  anomalies indeed are all cancelled locally.
Finally, we complete the discussion of the mixed 
gauge-gravitational anomaly. We conclude in section 5.
In an appendix we briefly describe the compact weak 
-manifolds with two conical singularities 
constructed in. They provide useful 
explicit examples to have in mind throughout
the main text.

Global anomaly cancellation for abelian gauge fields 

Anomalies that arise upon compactification of M-theory on
-manifolds with conical singularities were first 
analysed by
Witten. The well-known non-compact metrics 
are asymptotically, for large , a cone on a compact 
six-manifold
 with ,  or . 
The metrics on these manifolds all depend on some scale
which we call , and the conical limit is .
Of course, there is no singularity since, for small 
,
these metrics are perfectly regular. 
Mathematically, it is only in the limit  that a 
conical singularity develops. However, if  is as small as
the eleven-dimensional Planck length (or less) then, 
from the long-wave length limit of supergravity, 
the manifold looks as if  it
had a conical singularity. Said differently, the curvature 
is of
order  and supergravity ceases to be a valid
approximation. It was argued that generic 
singularities of compact  -manifolds are also 
conical. 

In the vicinity of a conical singularity  we can 
always introduce a local coordinate  such that
the metric can be written as 
e0  
s_X^2r_^2 + r_^2 s_Y_ ^2 

with  the metric on the compact
six-manifold . 
A necessary condition for  to
have -holonomy is  Ricci flatness. This in 
turn implies that  is an Einstein space with 
. In fact, 
has weak -holonomy. Furthermore, the 
Riemann tensors of  and  are related as 


, , 
and there are curvature invariants of  that diverge 
as . It was argued in
 that at each such singularity 
 there is a set 
of four-dimensional chiral supermultiplets 
. (This set may be empty as 
is the case for .)
They carry charges with respect to 
the abelian gauge group  that
arises from the Kaluza-Klein reduction of the three-form 
. Note, however, that they need not be charged with 
respect to all   gauge fields.

These charged chiral multiplets give rise to a
gauge anomaly
"at a given singularity " characterised by 
the standard gauge
anomaly polynomial 
e1  
I_^gauge =16 (2)^2 
_T_   ( _i=1 ^k q^i_F_i)^3 

where
 labels the various chiral multiplets   
present at 
and  is the charge of   under the 
 .
The same chiral multiplets also give rise, at each 
singularity, 
to a mixed gauge-gravitational anomaly characterised by
e2  
I_^mixed =-124 
_T_   ( _i=1 ^k q^i_F_i) p_1'
where  is the first 
Pontryagin 
class of the four-dimensional space-time . In ref. 
, it was argued that these anomalies are 
cancelled locally, i.e. separately for each singularity, 
by an appropriate non-invariance of the Chern-Simons and 
Green-Schwarz terms of eleven-dimensional 
supergravity:
e3 
S_CS  
&=& -112_11 ^2  CGG 
= -16 T_2^3(2)^2  CGG  ,


S_GS  &=& - T_22  CX_8  ,
where, for convenience, we replaced  by 
the membrane tension , via the usual relation 
.
Here  and  is the standard gravitational 
eight-form to be given below. With our conventions, the 
-field has dimension 0, 
so that the 3-form  and the 4-form  both have 
dimension . In particular,  is dimensionless.

Explicitly, the Kaluza-Klein reduction of  is
e4 
T_2 C=c + _n_n + A_i_i 
+_k _k + where ,  and  are harmonic 
1-, 2- and 3-forms on , and , , 
 and  are massless 3-, 2-, 1-form and 
scalar fields on . The dots stand for 
contributions of massive fields. In particular, 
one gets a four-dimensional abelian 
gauge field 
 for every harmonic 
2-form  on  . Indeed, the gauge symmetry
 with 
corresponds to a  gauge transformation 
. Note that the 
standard dimension for a gauge field  is 1, 
so that the one-forms  have dimension 0 and hence the 
 are dimensionless.
The Kaluza-Klein reduction of  implies a similar 
reduction for  which in particular contains a term
.

Due to the conical singularities, one has to be a bit 
more precise about which class of harmonic 2-forms one is
interested in. Inspection of the kinetic term 
 shows that one needs
square-integrable harmonic forms on , i.e. forms
satisfying ,
in order to get massless 4-dimensional fields with
finite kinetic terms. In particular, square-integrability
requires an appropriate  dependence as 
. 
As long as we are in a neighbourhood  of the conical
singularity  where () holds, we can adapt
the results of ref. : every -harmonic 
-form  on  with  
trivially extends to a
harmonic -form  on 
such that 
is convergent. The same 
obviously is true for the Hodge duals  
that are harmonic -forms on  with . In 
order to decide whether these forms are  on , 
i.e. whether  
converges at all singularities, one needs more 
information about the global structure of , 
which we are lacking. However, for
the examples of weak   
cohomogeneity-one metrics with two conical 
singularities constructed in this
global information is available and
it was shown that the harmonic 
forms considered above are indeed  and they 
are the only ones, so that
 for . Also, 
since for a compact Einstein space of positive 
curvature like  the first Betti number always 
vanishes, in these examples one then has . 
In the present 
case, we will simply need to assume that the 
-harmonic -forms on  for  are given, 
in the vicinity of , by the trivial extensions 
onto  of the -harmonic -forms on 
. In particular, then  
and . (Of course, for compact smooth  
-holonomy manifolds  always vanishes.)
Hence, the gauge group is  and the 
terms  are absent in ().

In it is argued that supergravity ceases
to be valid close to the singularities and 
 and  should be taken as
integrals over  only, where  is  with 
small neighbourhoods of the singularities excised. Then 
the boundary of  is ,
and the variation of  can be rewritten as a 
sum of boundary terms:
e5 
S_CS  _M_4X'  GG 
=-
__M_4Y_  GG  .
Upon doing the KK reduction this yields
e6 
S_CS 
__M_4 _i F_jF_k  
  _Y_ _i_j_k  .
Next one uses the relation
e7 
_T_  q_^i  q_^j q_^k 
= _Y_ _i_j_k 
d_ijk ^()  ,
found to be true
for the three standard  considered.
For the example of 
there is a single harmonic 2-form , given in terms 
of the Kahler form  as  and 
normalised such that .
This matches with the existence of a single multiplet with
. Note that the orientation of  
is important. In the examples discussed in the 
appendix one has e.g.  and 
, so that one must have 
 and . Given eq. (), 
it was concluded in that eq. () 
cancels the gauge anomaly of the chiral multiplets 
().

This cannot be the full story, however. In eq. () 
one uses Stoke's theorem to rewrite a bulk integral 
as a sum  of boundary contributions. While 
mathematically perfectly correct, it is not 
necessarily meaningful to assign a physical 
interpretation to the boundary contributions 
individually .(
As a trivial example consider integrating 0 over an interval
. If  is any  constant function we have
. Obviously,
there is no meaning in assigning a value  to the 
upper boundary and  to the lower one.
)  
These remarks suggest that the above argument
() - () is insufficient to show
the local  character of the 
anomaly cancellation, separately at each singularity. 
Indeed, as it stands, the KK reduction of the
integrand of the l.h.s. of eq. () does 
not give the desired 
contribution. For a  gauge transformation with 
 the only piece contained
in  which
is a 4-form on  and only involves the massless fields
is . In particular, the desired
piece  is a 5-form on  and 
cannot contribute. We conclude that eq. () is a 
somewhat artificial rewriting of zero, at least for
the terms of interest to us, and that equations
() and () only prove global 
anomaly cancellation, i.e. cancellation after summing 
the contributions of all singularities .
Indeed, global cancellation of the anomaly is 
the statement that . As 
remarked in, this is a simple 
consequence of eq. () and 

.
However, local cancellation still remains 
to be proven. As we will show next, it will require a 
modification of , much as when 
five-branes are present.

Local anomaly cancellation for abelian gauge fields 


The modified fields 

In the treatment of ref. 
of the five-brane anomaly a small neighbourhood 
of the five-brane is cut out creating a boundary (analogous 
to ). Then the anomalous Bianchi identity 
 is smeared out around this 
boundary and the -field gets an anomalous variation 
localised on this smeared out region. Alternatively, this 
could be viewed 
as due to a two-form field  living close to the boundary
and transforming as .
The CS-term is given by 

 with 
appropriately modified  and  (which coincide 
with  and  away from the five-brane and its 
neighbourhood) such that  is 
non-vanishing and cancels the left-over normal bundle 
anomaly.

Now we show that a similar treatment works for conical 
singularities. We first concentrate on the neighbourhood
of a given conical 
singularity  with a metric locally given by 
. 
The local radial 
coordinate obviously is , the singularity 
being at . As mentioned above, 
there are curvature invariants of  that diverge 
as . In particular, supergravity cannot be 
valid down to . Rather than cutting off the 
manifold  at some , we cut off the 
fields  which can be done in a smooth  way. 
However, we keep fixed the geometry, and in particular 
the metric and curvature on . 
Said differently, we cut off all fields that represent 
the quantum fluctuations but keep the background 
fields (in particular the background geometry) as before.
Introduce a small but finite regulator  and
the regularised step function 
 such that
e9 
_(r_&=& 0
if  0r_ ,


_(r_&=& 1
if  r_+ ,
with  a non-decreasing smooth function 
between  and . (Outside the 
neighbourhood where the local coordinate  is 
defined,  obviously equals 1.) We define 
the corresponding regularised -function one-form 
as(
We write  rather than  since the latter symbol 
already denotes the gauge variation of a quantity.) 
e10 
_ .
Of course, if  has several 
conical singularities (see the appendix for examples), 
 must have the appropriate 
behaviour () at each singularity . It can 
be constructed as the product of the individual 's 
and then  becomes the sum of the individual 's:
dsum 
_ .

When evaluating integrals one has to be careful since 
e.g. , although 
 would be just as good a definition of a regularised 
step function. We write  which means that,
in an integral, one 
can replace  by  when multiplied 
by a form that varies slowly between  and 
. However, one has e.g. 

 where a crucial 
 has appeared.  
Then, for any ten-form , not containing 
's or 's, we have
e10bis 
_M_4X  _(10)   ^n 
= _1n+1  
_M_4Y_   _(10)   .
It is always understood that the regulator is removed, 
, after the integration.

Now we cut off the fields with this  so that all 
fields vanish if  for some . 
Starting from  and  we define
e11 
C=C ,G=G .
Then the gauge-invariant kinetic term for the 
-field is constructed with :
e17a 
S_kin =-14_11 ^2  G  ^* G
=-14_11 ^2  _r_>   C ^* C
and the  resulting from the KK reduction of 
still are massless gauge fields.
To construct a satisfactory version of the Chern-Simons term,
we first note that,
of course,  and 
. However, we want a modified 
-field which vanishes for  , is closed 
everywhere and is gauge invariant. Closedness is 
achieved by subtracting from  a term , 
but this no longer is gauge invariant under 
. 

In order to maintain gauge invariance we add another 
two-form field , 
that effectively only lives
on the subspace  , with
e12 
B= .
In the limit ,  really is a ten-dimensional 
field, although we treat it as an "auxiliary" field that has no 
kinetic term.
Of course, a gauge-invariant kinetic term could be added
as 
but it is irrelevant for our present purpose.
In any case
e13 
- (C-B)satisfies all requirements:
e14 
 , ,
for  r_< .
We have
e15 
= 
with 
e15a 
+ B
and
e15b 
 + = (  )  .
The  anomaly 

All this is similar in spirit to ref., 
and we propose that  should be replaced by
e16 
_CS  = -16  T_2^3(2)^2  
_M_4X  
 .
We may view the differences  and  as 
gravitational corrections in an effective low-energy 
description of M-theory. Actually, further gravitational 
terms of higher order certainly are present, but they are 
irrelevant to the present discussion of anomaly cancellation.

Note that in order to discuss local anomaly cancellation, 
i.e. cancellation singularity by singularity, we are 
not allowed to integrate by parts, i.e. use Stoke's theorem. 
More precisely, 
we must avoid partial integration in the -direction 
since, as remarked above, this could shift contributions 
between the different singularities. However, once an 
expression is reduced to an integral over a given 
, corresponding to a given singularity, 
one may freely integrate by parts on , 
as usual. In particular consider any smooth - and
-forms  
and   not containing . Then
h11a 
_M_4X   ^n _
&=&  1n+1 _M_4Y_  


&&= (-)^p+1  1n+1 _M_4Y_  

= (-)^p+1  _M_4X   ^n _ .
We see that whenever an integral contains a  we are
allowed to "integrate by parts", but the derivative 
does not act on the 's.

Writing out  and  explicitly, the modified 
Chern-Simons term reads
e15c 
_CS   &=& 
-16  T_2^3(2)^2  _M_4X  
( CGG ^3 
+ ( BGG - 2 BCG) ^2 
) 




&& _CS ^(1)  + __CS  ^(2,)   ,
where we used , see eq. ().
In the limit , the first term 
 reproduces the usual bulk term, but only 
for , while the terms
, due to the presence of , 
each are localised 
on the ten-manifolds  close to the 
singularities . Although they look similar, they do
not  arise as boundary terms. We have
e16a 
_CS  ^(2,)  &=&
-118  T_2^3(2)^2 
_M_4Y_  
( BGG - 2 BCG) 


&=& -16 T_2^3(2)^2 
_M_4Y_  BGG  .
This result illustrates again eq. ().
An "anomalous" variation of each  
then arises since :
e16b 
_CS  ^(2,)  =  
-16  T_2^3(2)^2 
_M_4Y_  GG  .
Of course, there is also the "usual" variation of
:
e16c 
_CS ^(1)  =  
-16  T_2^3(2)^2 
_M_4X  GG ^3  .
Globally , this equals 

as could easily be seen when integrating by parts. Indeed, 
globally  is invariant. This is alright, 
since we know from that globally , 
i.e. when summed over the singularities, there are no 
anomalies to be cancelled.

Next, we will see what happens upon Kaluza-Klein reduction. 
We will keep all massless fields, not only the gauge fields.
In agreement with the above discussion we assume that 
. As before, let  be a basis of 
-harmonic 2-forms and  of -harmonic 
3-forms on . Then
kk 
T_2 C&=&c + A_i _i +_k _k + 

T_2 G&=& c + F_i_i+_k_k

T_2 B&=& + f_i _i +  ,
 and  are  massless scalar fields  similar 
to axions, while  and  are  3-form  and  2-form 
fields on  respectively. The dots indicate contributions 
of massive fields. Under a "gauge" transformation with 
gauge 
T_2 _i _i + one has for the 4-dimensional fields
transf 
c= , A_i = _i  , _k=0  ,  , f_i = _i  .
Then in the "bulk"-term
, the only non-vanishing contribution
of the massless fields is 
bulk 
_CS ^(1)  =  
-16 (2)^2 
_M_4  3 _k F_iF_j  
_X _k_i_j ^3 +  .
Obviously, this is gauge-invariant.
For the  terms , localised
near the singularities , we get
e16d 
_CS  ^(2,) =-16 (2)^2 
&( &
_M_4  f_i F_jF_k  
_Y_  _i_j_k 


&-&_M_4  _k_l  
_Y_  _k_l )
+  .
Under a  gauge transformation with  
but , the second term in this expression is 
invariant, but the first one is not.

We finally conclude that under a -gauge 
transformation with  
(but ) we have
e23 
_CS ^(1) &=&  0  ,




_CS  ^(2,) 
&=&
- 16 (2)^2 
_M_4   _i F_jF_k  
_Y_  _i_j_k   .
Using the relation () it is then 
obvious that, separately at each singularity,
this precisely cancels the gauge anomaly 
obtained from () via the descent equations.
Hence,
anomaly cancellation indeed occurs locally.

Before we go on, a remark is in order. To cancel the 
four-dimensional gauge anomalies we modified the 
eleven-dimensional Chern-Simons term, including a
new interaction with the ten-dimensional non-dynamical 
-field. This was natural and necessary to have an 
invariant -field. As a result, the gauge variation 
of the KK reduction of
 no longer vanishes and  
was seen to  cancel the four-dimensional 
gauge anomalies. This might look as if we had found a 
four-dimensional counterterm 
 to cancel the anomaly.
Now, a relevant anomaly cannot be cancelled by the 
variation of a local four-dimensional counterterm of 
the gauge fields. The point is, of course, that 
this  not only contains the 
gauge fields but also the axion-like fields  that 
arose from the non-dynamical -field and it is the 
non-invariance of the  that leads to anomaly 
cancellation. This is quite different from adding a 
four-dimensional counterterm.

It is also interesting to note that under transformations
with  we get non-vanishing 
, with no corresponding 
"fermion anomaly" to be cancelled locally. Of course,
globally these variations vanish, but locally they do not.
However, this is not harmful as it would be for gauge anomalies,
since anyway, these transformations only affect
fields that do not propagate on .

The mixed gauge-gravitational anomaly 

The mixed gauge-gravitational 
anomaly () should be cancelled similarly through
local anomaly "inflow" from an appropriately modified
Green-Schwarz term. This now involves the gauge fields 
and the gravitational fields. Which fields should be cut 
off at the singularities? Our general philosophy is to 
keep fixed the background fields and in particular the 
background geometry, but to cut off the fluctuations around 
this background. If we call  the spin-connection 
of the background geometry, and  the one 
of the full geometry including the fluctuations 
around , then one should cut off only  so that

. In principle one should then work 
with the gravitational 8-form  computed with 
this , and start with
g1 
_GS =-T_22  X_8  .
Dealing correctly with the cut-off spin connection requires
some machinery which we will only introduce in the next 
section where we deal with non-abelian gauge fields. However,
there we will also see that the two terms  and 
 (with  a non-abelian field 
strength and  its cut-off version) lead to exactly 
the same anomaly inflow for 
the mixed  anomaly. Hence we expect that, 
in the same way,  and  
may also lead to the same anomaly inflow for the mixed 
-gravitational anomaly. We will explicitly 
verify this in section 4.4. Here we consider(
Alternative forms of the Green-Schwarz term would be
 or
. Although globally 
equivalent to (), respectively (), 
a priori they could lead to different local variations. 
Nevertheless, we have checked that the final result 
always equals ().
) 
g2 
_GS '=-T_22  X_8  .
As usual,  is given by 
.

Let us comment on the sign of the Green-Schwarz term.
For the original Green-Schwarz term, written either as 
 or as
 with  one can find 
both signs in the literature depending on the sign convention 
used for . However, with the convention we use, where the 
coefficient in   in front of  is 
, the 
correct sign for the Green-Schwarz term is 
.
In particular, having the same signs for the Chern-Simons
and the Green-Schwarz terms
is a necessary condition for the cancellation of the 
normal bundle anomaly of the five-brane(
In fact, ref. seems to start with the 
opposite sign for the Green-Schwarz term, but carefully 
repeating their calculation 
reveals an additional minus sign in their eq. (3.11)
due to the fact that  is the boundary of 
 but with its orientation reversed.
A detailed account of these computations can be found 
in.
) 
as described in ref..
Similarly, as shown in, the correct Green-Schwarz 
term of the heterotic string with an 

can only be reproduced from the interplay of the M-theory 
Chern-Simons and Green-Schwarz terms having the same 
signs.

In  the curvature  is evaluated with . 
In principal, one should consider arbitrary fluctuations 
 that do not necessarily preserve the product 
structure of the manifold, , but, for 
simplicity, we will assume they do.(
As always, dangerous anomalies are 
associated with the massless modes. Hence, we 
only need to consider fluctuations of the metric that are  
massless. Massless fluctuations that do not preserve 
the product structure would arise e.g. if  had 
non-trivial Killing vectors. However, we know that for
-manifolds this is not the case.
)  
Then one can rewrite 
 in terms of the first Pontryagin classes 
 and 

of  and  respectively as 
. 
Note that this is second and higher order in the fluctuations
since the background geometry of  is flat .
Hence
g3 
_GS '=+T_296  p_1' p_1"  .
Inserting the Kaluza Klein decomposition of  we get again
a "bulk" part and a sum of contributions localised 
close to the singularities:
g4 
_GS '&=& _GS ^'(1)  
+ __GS  ^'(2,)   ,


_GS ^'(1)  &=&196  _M_4  _k p_1' 
_X _kp_1"  ,


_GS  ^'(2,)  &=&124  _M_4  f_i p_1'
  14  _Y_  _ip_1"  .
In the last integral over ,  now is the 
first Pontryagin class of . This follows easily 
from the properties of the characteristic classes for 
the geometry at hand.(
Explicitly, this can be seen as follows.
On  one has 

. But for the cones 
. Furthermore, the curvature 2-forms on  
and  are related by 
 with  the 6-beins on . Since 
with the relevant geometries we have
 one sees that
 and 
hence . 
Of course, eq. () is 
unchanged by the fluctuations of the geometry on  since
 has topologically invariant integrals, and so does
.
) 
Now one uses another relation which relates the charges
of the chiral fermions to the geometric properties of 
namely
g5 
14  _Y_  _ip_1"(Y_)
= _T_  q^i_ .
The only of the three examples for which this relation 
is non-trivial is  where
 and one correctly gets 
. Then
g6 _GS  ^'(2,)  
=_T_ q^i_24  _M_4  f_i p_1' .
Finally, we conclude that under a  gauge 
transformation  is invariant while
g7 
_GS  ^'(2,)   = 
_T_ q^i_24  _M_4  _i p_1' .
This is exactly what we need to provide local cancellation
of the mixed gauge-gravitational anomaly due to the chiral 
fermions associated with ().



Anomaly cancellation for non-abelian gauge fields 

If  has ADE singularities
non-abelian gauge fields are generated.
Since ADE singularities have codimension four, 
the set of singular 
points is a three-dimensional submanifold . Such 
geometries have been discussed extensively in the 
literature see e.g.. The interesting 
situation is when  itself has a 
conical singularity. In the neighbourhood of 
such a singularity , we may still think of  
as a cone on , but now  is an ADE orbifold. 
Let  be the two-dimensional singularity 
(fixed-point) set of . Then locally  is a 
cone on .

On the seven-dimensional space-time  there live 
non-abelian ADE gauge fields  with curvature .
After KK reduction they give rise to 
four-dimensional ADE gauge fields and
field strengths which we call again  and .
In addition, on , we may still have abelian gauge fields
 with field strength , which arise from 
the KK reduction of the -field.
The four-dimensional chiral supermultiplets  
present at the singularities  now couple to the 
gauge fields of the non-abelian group  and are 
charged with respect to the abelian . Then there 
are potentially ,  and  anomalies. 
The first are cancelled as described above by inflow from 
the  term. The  anomaly is present only
for . 

Consistent versus covariant anomalies 

In the non-abelian case anomalies can manifest themselves
in two different ways, as consistent or covariant anomalies
. As is well-known from the early days of the
triangle anomaly in four dimensions, if the regularisation
of the one-loop diagram respects Bose symmetry in the 
external gauge fields one gets the consistent anomaly. 
Alternatively one may preserve gauge invariance 
(current conservation) for two of the three external 
gauge fields (including contributions of square and 
pentagon diagrams), with all non-invariance only in 
the third field. This leads to the covariant form of 
the anomaly. For one chiral fermion of unit charge 
this (integrated) covariant anomaly is given by
e30 
A _covariant ^SU(N)^3 =12 (2)^2 
_M_4    F^2  .
Similarly, the (integrated) consistent anomaly 
for one chiral fermion of unit charge is
e29 
A _consistent ^SU(N)^3 =16 (2)^2 
_M_4   ( AA+12  A^3)  .
The consistent anomaly is related via the descent 
equations(
, , with


 and

.
) 
to the invariant six-form 
. Obviously, since the 
covariant anomaly cannot be obtained this way, 
it is not possible to find a local 
counterterm  of the gauge fields such that

. However, on the level of the corresponding
currents  one can find a local  such 
that .

Clearly, if the consistent anomalies cancel when summed 
over the contributions of all chiral fermions, the same 
is true for the covariant anomalies, and vice versa. 
Here, however, we want to cancel a non-vanishing anomaly 
due to chiral fermions (originating from a given conical 
singularity) by an appropriate anomaly inflow from a 
higher-dimensional action, i.e. by some . 
Such a setup respects Bose symmetry between all gauge 
fields and it is clear that we must cancel the consistent 
anomaly, not the covariant one. Indeed, when invoking 
anomaly inflow, one wants to show that the resulting total
effective action is invariant. But any non-invariance 
of part of the effective action must satisfy the 
Wess-Zumino consistency conditions and hence 
be the consistent anomaly. There has been some
discussion in the literature about consistent versus
covariant inflow: 
in all cases there is a consistent anomaly due to 
fermions to be cancelled by an inflow.(
In these papers a first inflow computationgave a covariant anomaly inflow in discrepancy with the 
consistent anomaly due to the fermions.
It was then argued that a careful 
computation of the inflow actually gives two pieces 
for the current, 
the old covariant one, and a new one converting the 
consistent fermion current into a covariant one. 
However, a more fruitful interpretation is to
observe that the new inflow contribution is exactly 
what was needed to convert the old covariant inflow
into a consistent inflow.) 

Similarly, the mixed  anomaly  can also 
be expressed in a covariant or consistent form.
The consistent form derives from the invariant 
6-form  via 
the descent equations. It can manifest itself as 
 or
 or any 
combination of these two with total weight one:
e31 
A _consistent ^U(1)_i G^2 =q^i2 (2)^2 
_M_4  (  _i F^2 
+(1-) F_i  A )  .
The parameter  can be changed by the addition
of a local four-dimensional counterterm 
 (where ).
Note that the mixed  anomaly is 
present for any , not only .
As for the pure  anomaly, the mixed anomaly 
can also be expressed in a covariant form, but we
will not need it here.(
As for the  anomaly, the 
covariant form arises if, in the triangle diagram, one 
maintains  or  gauge invariance at two of the 
vertices and then checks the gauge variations at the 
third vertex. If one probes for  invariance, there 
are non-abelian gauge fields at the two other vertices, 
while when probing -invariance there are one abelian 
and one non-abelian gauge field at the other vertices, 
yielding a relative combinatorial factor 2. Hence the 
covariant mixed anomaly is
e31a 
A _covariant ^U(1)_i G^2 =q^i2 (2)^2 
_M_4  ( _i F^2 
+ 2 F_i  F )  .
This is similar to () with , 
but the coefficient is again 3 times larger and, of 
course, we have the covariant  instead 
of .
) 

The  anomaly 

In ref. it was argued that these anomalies 
can be cancelled by the non-invariance of certain 
interactions, namely  
for the  anomaly and 
 for the mixed 
one. Here  is the curvature of a certain line bundle 
with a connection induced by the metric on . 
 is a 2-form on  and 
must obey  except at the singularities of 
where one could get -function contributions. 
Thus it makes sense to define
e38 
n_U_  K2    .
Actually,  is the first Chern class 
of the line bundle and hence the  are integers.
To show that the variation of 
 and  cancel the fermion anomalies,
ref. again integrates by parts on .
According to our discussion above this only proves 
that anomalies cancel globally. To achieve local
cancellation we should first find interactions localised
close to the singularities, such that their variations 
individually cancel the fermion anomalies at each 
singularity. This will again involve cutting off the 
gauge fields using , but things will be slightly 
more complicated due to the non-linear structure of 
the non-abelian fields.

To see how we should cut off the non-abelian 
gauge fields we recall the important points of 
the abelian case: 1) all (fluctuating) fields should vanish 
close enough to the conical singularities and
equal the usual ones "sufficiently far away" 
from these singularities, and 
2) the modified field strengths should have the 
same properties as the unmodified ones. 
The first requirement allows fields to be a combination 
of terms involving  or  with . 
In the abelian case only  occurred, see eqs 
() and (). The field strength 
 obeyed  and  just as 
 and . Hence, it satisfied also 
the second requirement. This was guaranteed because 
the relation between  and  was the same as 
the one between  and , namely , while 
the gauge transformation was  
with an explicit  to make sure the transformed 
field also satisfies the first requirement.

Now we want to apply both requirements to the 
non-abelian case. The gauge field  and field 
strength  (defined on the 7-manifold ) should  
be replaced by cut off fields  and . It is 
then clear that the second requirement will be 
satisfied if
f1 
+[,]
and
f2 
+ ^2  .
From the first requirement then
f3 
 .
(Here,  is a Lie algebra-valued smooth function 
on .) In particular these equations guarantee that
f4 
, +[,] = 0  ,
as usual. The difference with the abelian case is that 
the non-linear structure () together with
() imply that  
cannot simply be of the form , but instead is
f5 
n=1 ^
( a_n^n + f_n ^n-1 )  .
The  are smooth 1-form fields on , 
while the  are smooth scalar fields, also on  
 but effectively only on 
. The latter are analogous 
to the -field of the abelian case.
Note that "in the bulk", i.e. for  
where  and , we have
f6 
_bulk  =_n=1 ^a_n .
The gauge transformation () implies
f7 
a_1=&,& f_1=


a_n= [a_n-1 ,]   &,& 
f_n = [f_n-1 ,] , n2  .
In particular, it follows that the
"bulk"-field  
transforms as an ordinary gauge field,
f8 
_bulk 
=+ [ _bulk  ,  ]
as it should.
To simplify the notations below, we introduce
f9 
a&& a()= _n=1 ^a_n ^n 


f&& f()= _n=1 ^f_n ^n-1 
so that
f10 
 .
Let furthermore ,
as well as 
and .
Of course,  behaves as an exterior derivative and,
in particular, .
Then  and
f11 
a + (f-a') .
Finally, we are in a position to show that the consistent 
fermion anomaly is cancelled by the non-invariance of the 
following interaction
(
Actually, we should start with an  where also 
 is replaced by  with  
corresponding 
to the background geometry and  taking into 
account fluctuations around this background. Here 
 is the appropriately cut-off spin connection 
on the line bundle: . It is easy 
to include this -term into the computation 
which follows and show that it does not contribute 
to .
) 
f12 
_1=-16(2)^2  _M_4Q  
K2  _5()
where  is the standard Chern-Simons 5-form with 
replacing , namely
f13 
_5()=( + 32  ^3+35  ^5 )  .
This is a sum of a "bulk" term not containing  and a term
linear in , so that we can again write
f13a 
_1=_1^(1) +__1 ^(2,)   ,
where 
the  reduce to integrals over
. Although it is straightforward to 
explicitly  compute the  ,
the resulting expressions are not very illuminating. 
However, their gauge variations turn out to be simple, and
this is why we will first compute the variations
, and
then reduce them to integrals over
.

Since  satisfies the standard relation ()
we know that
f14 
_5()= _4^1(,)
with
f15 
_4^1(,) =  ( 
+ 12  ^3 )  ,
so that
f16 
_1=-16(2)^2  _M_4Q  
K2  _4^1(,)  .
The next step is to explicitly evaluate the integrand,
substituting  and () and () 
for  and . We get
f17 
_1^(1)  &=& 
-16(2)^2  _M_4Q  
K2  ( a a
+ 12  a^3 ) 

_1 ^(2,) &=&
-16(2)^2  _M_4Q  
K2  ( a a 
-  (a a' + a'a) +  ( a f + f a)  

& &+12   a^3 
-12   (a' a^2 + a a' a + a^2 a') 

& &+12  (a^2 f + a f a + f a^2) )  _ .
(Of course,  is shorthand for
, etc.)

To go further, we perform 
the Kaluza-Klein reduction. Each 1-form field  on 
 becomes a 1-form field on  which we 
also denote by , and a scalar field  on   
for every harmonic 1-form  on 
, plus massive modes. The scalars  simply 
become scalars on  (again denoted ), 
plus massive modes. 
Since  already is a 3-form on ,
the  cannot contribute in 
, while in 
we must pick out the part linear 
in . It is 


, where now 
 is the exterior derivative on 
. Clearly, after integration over  
this term vanishes:
f17a 
_1^(1) =0 .
It remains to evaluate  with  
and  now 1- and 0-forms on . 
To see how to perform the integrals over , 
consider e.g. the terms that only involve two -fields:
f18 
& &_M_4Q  K2  ( a a 
-  (a a' + a'a) ) _

&=&
_M_4Q  K2  _n,m=1 ^
( a_n a_m 
-  a_n m a_m -  n a_na_m))
 ^n+m  _

&=&_M_4U_  K2  _n,m=1 ^1n+m+1 
( a_n a_m 
- m  a_n a_m - n  a_na_m))
 .


At this point the -integral is reduced to a sum 
of integrals over  and now we can 
safely integrate by parts.
The three terms then all 
are  and the coefficients add 
up as . Using () we get 
, where now 
f18a 
A=_n=1 ^a_n 
is the Kaluza-Klein reduction of the "bulk" field 
 encountered before in
().
Similarly one sees that the terms involving  
do not contribute,(
Of course, we could have "integrated by parts" according 
to the rule  () directly in 
in (), showing immediately that the -fields 
do not contribute.
)  
while the terms involving three 
-fields add up to give 
.
We conclude that
f19 
_1 ^(2,) =- n_6(2)^2  
 _M_4  
 ( A A + 12  A^3 )
 .
Provided the  coincide with the number of 
charged chiral multiplets present at the singularity 
, as suggested in, the 
non-invariance of the interaction () 
cancels the  anomaly locally, separately 
at each singularity.

Quite remarkably,
the final result is simple with all contributions 
of the different  adding up to reproduce 
. Alternatively, 
one might have first expanded . Then 
 would have reduced to an
integral over   with the
integral of  over  just giving
. The result would have been
a four-dimensional action involving infinitely 
many fields  and . While the gauge 
transformations of each term individually are 
complicated, we know that they sum up to give
().


The  anomaly 

It remains to discuss the cancellation of the mixed 
 anomaly (). 
Clearly, the variation of an interaction 
 can
cancel the consistent anomaly () with . 
However, following our general philosophy, we 
should really start with
e44 
_2 = -T_22(2)^2  _M_4Q  
^2  .
Note that in the bulk this coincides with the standard
interaction .
Since  was designed to be gauge invariant 
under () only  contributes to the 
gauge variation of . 
Again, we write .
Inserting 
 from 
eq. () and  
from () and () we get
f21 
_2^(1)  &=& -T_22(2)^2  
_M_4Q  
 (aa+2 a^2a) 

_2 ^(2,)  &=& -T_22(2)^2  
_M_4Q  
[  (aa+2 a^2a)


&& 2.cm
+ 2 ( (fa+f a^2)
-a'(a+a^2))] _ .
When we perform the Kaluza Klein reduction, 
 and 
, in 
only terms linear in  can 
contribute, but they vanish after partial integration 
over , just as for . Also as 
before, in ,  
cannot contribute, while the terms containing  
again vanish after partial integration over . 
The remaining terms combine to yield
f22 
_2 ^(2,)  
= -12(2)^2   _U_  _i
_M_4  _i (A A + 2 A^2 A)  .
Provided 
f22a 
_U_  _i=_T_  q^i_ ,

this exactly cancels the mixed 
 anomaly locally. Note that the variation of

 would have produced exactly the same result.

The mixed gauge-gravitational anomaly once more 

Now we dispose of the necessary machinery to show
that  the variation of the modified Green-Schwarz term 
() with cut-off  leads to the same local
anomaly contribution as the variation of () 
using the ordinary .

To begin with, we replace the spin connection 
 by its cut-off version
h1 
 .
 represents the fixed background 
and  the fluctuations. For the time being we make 
no assumption about , but later on we will again 
restrict to fluctuations that preserve the product structure 
of the manifold. Again we write
h2 
+with  and
. 
Of course,
h2a 
_n=1 ^_n =  ,
since in the bulk, where  and , we want 
 to coincide with .

We require that 
under a local Lorentz transformation with parameter 
 one has
h3 
_L  + [ , _L ] , 
_L  = _L  .
This ensures that 
h4 
transforms covariantly:  and
h5 
^n=0  .
Comparing powers of  and  in eq. () shows that
the background is not transformed, , as expected, and
,   and, for 
,,
, where  is the covariant 
derivative with . Again we define 
 and
, and idem 
for . Then  and for 
the curvature we find
h6 
()=() + ()with
h7 
() &=& R_0++_0+_0+^2


()&=& +[_0+ , ]- .
Two useful identities which follow from the Bianchi 
identity  are
h8 
&=& [ , _0+]


&=& -(_0+)-(_0+)+[,]
- . 
Finally, the cut-off gravitational 8-form  
then is given by
h9 
X_8 &=& 1192 (2)^3  
( ^4-14  (^2)^2 )


&=& 1192 (2)^3  
( ^4 + 4^3  -14  (^2)^2 - ^2  )  .
By construction, , as well as each of the four 
terms individually, is invariant under local Lorentz 
transformations. Hence, using  and 
, we find
h10 
_GS  &=& _GS ^(1)  
+ __GS  ^(2,) 


_GS ^(1)  &=& -T_2192 (2)^4  
C ( ^4-14  (^2)^2 ) 

_GS  ^(2,)  &=& -T_2192 (2)^4  
( B^4 + 4 C ^3 -14  B (^2)^2 
- C ^2  ) _ .


While  involves an integral over all 
of , each  reduces 
to an integral over . We could perfectly 
well do this reduction first and then compute the gauge 
variation of each . However, as 
for the Yang-Mills case, the computations are 
more compact if we first take the variation and then 
evaluate the integral. Using 
,  and the invariance 
of the gravitational terms we find
h11 
_GS ^(1)  &=& -T_2192 (2)^4  
( ^4-14  (^2)^2 ) 

_GS  ^(2,)  &=& -T_2192 (2)^4  
( ^4 + 4 ^3 -14  (^2)^2 
- ^2  ) _ .


We will discuss  later on. As 
familiar by now, thanks to the presence of ,
each  is reduced to 
an integral over  with every 
contributing a factor . On , 
the derivative  acts as an ordinary derivative ,
and we are allowed to integrate by parts. As explained in 
eq. () above, it is easy to see
that exactly the same result is obtained if
one first replaces  by  and integrates all  
by parts 
directly in (), remembering that 
 only acts on the ,  and , but 
not on the .
Using this observation, we rewrite
h12 
_GS  ^(2,)  = -T_2192 (2)^4  
(^4 - 4  (^3)
-14   (^2)^2 
+  (^2 ) ) _ .
Now use the identities () to show that 
and
h12a 
 (^l)=-^l( 
)
= - 1l+1    ^l+1 
so that
h13 
_GS  ^(2,)  = -T_2192 (2)^4  
( 1 +   ) 
( ^4 -14   (^2)^2 ) _ .
Next, we expand the integrand in powers of . Writing
 with 
and 
 for , 
we see that the 1 in the 
parenthesis in () contributes a factor
 to the integral over 
while the 
contributes a factor , 
both adding up to 1. As a result, we get
h14 
_GS  ^(2,)  = -T_2192 (2)^4  
_M_4Y_   
( R^4 -14   (R^2)^2 ) 
-T_22  _M_4Y_    X_8(R) ,
where now
h15 
R=_n=0 ^_n  .
Clearly,  is the value of the curvature "in the bulk"
of   (or its 
appropriate pullback onto ), 
and corresponds to the fluctuating 
geometry  without cutting off anything. 
Hence we see that, in the end, this rather sophisticated 
treatment reproduces the same result as the more naive 
 of eq (). 
It is clear from our analysis that this same simplification
occurs for any 
invariant quantity made from combinations of 
or .

It remains to discuss . With 
, the integral will be non-vanishing 
only if  is a 
3-form on  and a 5-form on . If the fluctuations 
of the metric preserve the product structure , 
this is clearly impossible, and we conclude 
h16 
_GS ^(1) =0 .

For more general fluctuations, 
however, it is less clear what happens and we will not pursue 
this issue further.

Conclusions 

We have reconsidered the anomaly cancellation mechanism
on -holonomy manifolds with conical singularities, 
first outlined 
in. It turned out that we needed to 
modify the eleven-dimensional Chern-Simons and 
Green-Schwarz terms, and similarly the interactions 
 and  present on ADE singularities, by (smoothly)
cutting 
off the fields close to the conical singularities. This 
induces anomalous variations of the  cut-off 3-form 
field  and of the cut-off non-abelian gauge field 
. These anomalous variations are localized in the 
regions close to the conical singularities where the 
cut-off is done. This implies that the corresponding 
non-invariance of the action is also localized there 
and we get one  term for each conical 
singularity . 
Each of these terms then exactly cancels the various
anomalies that are present at these singularities 
due to the charged chiral fermions living there.
Thus anomaly cancellation indeed occurs locally, i.e. 
separately for each conical singularity.

Throughout the whole discussion it is always assumed that the 
-holonomy manifold is compact, although the explicit
examples of conical singularities are actually taken from 
the known non-compact -holonomy manifolds, assuming that 
conical singularities on compact -manifolds have the
same structure. As mentioned in the introduction, there 
exist close relatives of -holonomy manifolds which 
are weak  -holonomy manifolds. In this case, 
it is quite easy to construct compact  examples with 
conical singularities and explicitly known metrics. This 
is done in and will be briefly 
recalled in the appendix. The conical singularities are 
exactly as assumed in the present paper, namely for 
 they are cones on some  with the same 
's as considered here. This implies that the whole 
discussion of chiral fermions present at the singularities 
and of the anomaly cancellation of the present paper 
directly carries over
to these weak -holonomy manifolds.

Appendix 

Here we will briefly recall the geometry of the singular 
weak -holonomy manifolds  constructed in 
. Although they have weak -holonomy 
rather than -holonomy, they are the prototype 
of the compact manifolds with conical singularities 
one has in mind throughout the present paper. 

In it was shown that for 
every non-compact -manifold that is asymptotic 
(for large ) to a cone on , there is an associated 
compact weak -manifold with its metric given by
a1 
s^2_X  = r^2 + ( R rR )^2 
 s^2_Y  , 0rR  .
It has two conical singularities. The first one, at 
, is a cone on , while the second one, at 
, is a cone on . Here  equals  
but with its orientation reversed. 
This reversal of orientation simply occurs 
since we define  always  such that the normal 
vector points away from the singularity.
Hence:
a2 
Y_1=Y  , Y_2=-Y  .
For these examples we have all the necessary global 
information, and it was shown in that the 
square-integrable harmonic -forms on , for 
, are the trivial extensions of the 
square-integrable harmonic -forms on . In particular,
we have ,  and 
.

According to the general cut-off procedure described 
in section 3.1, for these examples one introduces 
two local coordinates  and . 
It follows that , where, in the limit 
of vanishing regularisation,
a3 
_1&=&(r_1-) r_1= (r-) r 


_2&=&(r_2-) r_2= - (r-(R-)) r  .
Then for a smooth 10-form  one has
a4 
_M_4X   
=_M_4Y  _r=  
-_M_4Y  _r=R-  
=_M_4Y_1  +_M_4Y_2   .
