Abstract 



Renormalization group evolution of QCD composite light-cone operators, built from
two and more quark and gluon fields, is responsible for the logarithmic scaling
violations in diverse physical observables. We analyze spectra of anomalous
dimensions of these operators at large conformal spins at weak and strong
coupling with the emphasis on the emergence of a dual string picture. The
multi-particle spectrum at weak coupling has a hidden symmetry due to
integrability of the underlying dilatation operator which drives the evolution.
In perturbative regime, we demonstrate the equivalence of the one-loop cusp
anomaly to the disk partition function in two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory which
admits a string representation. The strong coupling regime for anomalous
dimensions is discussed within the two pictures addressed recently, - minimal
surfaces of open strings and rotating long closed strings in AdS background. In
the latter case we find that the integrability implies the presence of extra
degrees of freedom - the string junctions. We demonstrate how the analysis of
their equations of motion naturally agrees with the spectrum found at weak
coupling.

Introduction 


The formalism of path-ordered exponentials, or Wilson loops, is an indispensable
tool in QCD. It allows one to formulate complicated QCD dynamics in terms of
gauge invariant degrees of freedom and express correlation functions
as a sum over random walks, e.g.,
0J_(x) J_(0)0 
=
_C ^- m  L[C]   _ [C]
 0 P i_C dx_A^(x)  0 
 ,
where  is the
electromagnetic current of a quark with mass .  is the length of a
closed path  that passes through the points  and .
 is a geometrical phase, the so-called Polyakov spin
factor, that takes into account the variation of the quark spin upon parallel
transport along the path . To evaluate corr-func , one has to calculate
the (nonperturbative) expectation value of the Wilson loop for an arbitrary path
 and perform resummation in the right-hand side of corr-func . Both tasks
are extremely difficult and can not be performed in full at the current stage.
Recently, a significant progress has been achieved in understanding the strong
coupling dynamics of supersymmetric gauge theoriesbased on the gauge/string correspondence. One of
the goals of the present paper is to establish a relation between certain QCD
observables and their counterparts in string theory.

There exists a special class of QCD observables, for which the sum
over paths in the right-hand side of corr-func  can be
performed exactly. As a relevant physical example, let us consider
a propagation of an energetic quark through a cloud of soft
gluons. In the limit when its energy goes to infinity, the quark
behaves as a point-like charged particle that moves along a straight
line and interacts with soft gluons. This means that the sum over
all paths in corr-func  is dominated in that case by a saddle
point describing a propagation of a quark along its classical
path. The Wilson loop corresponding to this path has the meaning
of the eikonal phase acquired by the quark field upon interaction
with gluons. In this way, the Wilson loop encodes universal
features of soft radiation in QCD. Let us point out two important
QCD observables, in which similar semiclassical regime occurs: the
Isgur-Wise heavy-meson form factor, , and parton
distributions in a hadron, , at the edge of the phase space,
. As we will demonstrate below, both observables are given
by an expectation value of a Wilson loop with the integration
contour  fixed by the kinematics of the process. A unique
feature of the contour  is that it contains a few cusps at points
in Minkowski space-time where the interaction with a large momentum
has occured in the underlying process.

In this way, Wilson loops with cusps, being fundamental objects in gauge
theories, have a direct relevance for QCD phenomenology. Their calculation in the
strong coupling (nonperturbative) regime is one of the prominent problems in
gauge theories. In the present paper, we make use of a recent progress in
understanding the strong coupling behavior of the  supersymmetric
(SUSY) Yang-Mills (YM) theory to get some insights into properties of Wilson
loops in QCD. Our analysis relies on the gauge/string duality between
 SUSY gauge theory and a string theory on AdSS
background.
(Note that recently there were several studies which aimed on the
derivation of strong coupling results for high-energy QCD observables, most
notably Refs. .) 
A natural question arises: what is in common between QCD and 
SUSY Yang-Mills theory? The two theories have quite different dynamics at
large distances, while at short distances they have many features in common.
For instance, anomalous dimensions of twist-two operators, contributing to
high-energy QCD processes, have a similar form in two theories including their
behavior at large Lorentz spin. Having this relation in mind, we will study
expressions for resummed anomalous dimensions in the 
SUSY Yang-Mills theory.
(Since the anomalous dimensions originate from short distances,
we find it appropriate to refer to them in the strong coupling regime as
resummed anomalous dimensions rather then nonperturbative ones.) 

We concentrate on two observations relevant to our present discussion. Recently,
it was proposed that anomalous dimensions of twist-two composite operators with
large Lorentz spin  are equal in the strong coupling limit to the "Energy
 Spin" of  a folded closed string rotating in AdS and having the shape
of a long rigid rod (mimicking the adjoint QCD string of glue with heavy quarks
at the folding points)_J(_s) = E - J
= 2 _s N_c     J +
O (J^0)
 .
Another observation comes from the calculation of the Wilson loop in the strong
coupling regime via the minimal surface, , swept by an
open string which goes into the fifth AdS dimension and whose ends trace its
contour in Minkowski space. This picture naturally embeds the color
flux tubes between the color sources, albeit penetrating into an extra Liouville
dimension as compared to the conventional four-dimensional setup.
 From the QCD perspective, one is mostly interested in calculating Wilson loops
with cusps. Such contours were considered in a number of studies
. For the -shaped Wilson loop
with two cusps (see Eq. W-DIS  below) the result readsW( vn )
=
(i A _min )
 , A _min 
=
i _s N_c    ^2 (i vn  )
 .
Comparing GKP  and W-min , one notices that  and 
depend on the coupling constant in the same manner. The coincidence is not
accidental, of course. Identifying -factor as the leading term
in the expression for the cusp anomalous dimension 
 _cusp  (_s) = _s N_c    +
O ((_s )^0)
 ,
one can show that Eqs. GKP  and W-min  hold in a conformal gauge
theory for arbitrary coupling constant . Eq. cusp-strong 
defines the asymptotic behavior of  in
the  SUSY YM theory in the strong coupling regime.

In the present paper, we will extend these results to composite QCD operators
of higher twist, built from an arbitrary number of fields and having autonomous
renormalization scale evolution. Such operators are known in QCD as
multi-particle conformal operators. We determine the spectrum of their anomalous
dimensions at large Lorentz spins, , both in weak and strong coupling
regimes. At weak coupling, the spectrum has a hidden symmetry due to
integrability of the dilatation operator in the underlying Yang-Mills theory. At
strong coupling, the two different pictures, - the rotating folded long string
and the minimal surface swept by an open string with ends attached to the cusp,
- result into the same asymptotic expression for the anomalous dimension of
conformal operators. We argue that integrability at weak coupling implies the
presence of extra stringy degrees of freedom at strong coupling, - the string
junctions, - and elucidate the relation between the anomalous dimensions of
multi-particle conformal operators at strong coupling and solutions to the
classical equations of motion for the string junctions.

To sew together the expressions for the anomalous dimensions at weak and strong
coupling, one needs the stringy description of the weak coupling regime in
Yang-Mills theory. One approach to the derivation of such stringy picture, based
on the hidden integrability of evolution equations for the light-cone operators,
has been developed in. It relies on the identification of the
underlying Yang-Mills dilatation operator as the Hamiltonian of
 Heisenberg spin chain. The  group naturally
appears in this context as a subgroup of the four-dimensional conformal group
acting on the light-cone. Due to complete integrability of the spin chain model,
the spectrum of the anomalous dimensions of multi-particle light-cone operators
can be found exactly in terms of the Riemann surfaces whose genus is related to
the number of the particles involved. As a consequence, the twist expansion on
the light-cone was shown to correspond to the summation over the genera of the
corresponding Riemann surfaces.



Our consequent presentation is organized as follows. In section 2 we review the
relation of certain QCD observables to expectation values of Wilson lines and
elucidate the physical meaning of the cusp anomaly. We also give there results
for the two-loop cusp anomalous dimensions in supersymmetric theories. In section
, we turn to multi-particle operators and show how conformal
symmetry in gauge theory simplifies the problem of finding the spectrum of their
anomalous dimensions. We demonstrate the way the integrability of the evolution
equations arises through the identification of the underlying dilatation operator
with the Hamiltonian of a Heisenberg spin chain. In the subsequent section we
address the stringy interpretation of the gauge theory results. Our analysis
suggests that the cusp anomaly at weak coupling is described by a string which is
different from the Nambu-Goto string. To identify this string we show that the
cusp anomalous dimension to one-loop order is equal to the transition amplitude
for a test particle on the  group manifold, which in its turn
is given by the partition function of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory on a disk
which admits a stringy representation. Next, in section , we
discuss the strong coupling computation within the open and closed string theory
context for multi-particle operators extending earlier results. Section 6
contains concluding remarks. In the appendix, we calculate the contribution of
vacuum polarization to the two-loop cusp anomaly in dimensional regularization
and dimensional reduction schemes.


Wilson loops as QCD observables 


As was emphasized in the introduction, there are several QCD
observables directly related to expectation values of Wilson
lines.


Isgur-Wise form factor 


The Isgur-Wise form factor  describes the electromagnetic transition
of a heavy meson  with mass  and momentum 
, built from a heavy quark and a light component, to the same meson with
momentum  (with )
 
In the heavy-quark limit, , it depends only on the product of
velocities , or equivalently on the angle
 between them in Minkowski space-time. The operator 
annihilates the heavy quark inside the meson . For 
, the heavy quark behaves as a classical particle with the velocity
 interacting with the light component of the meson through its eikonal
current, 
 with  being the quark color charge. This allows one
to replace
  (x) ^-im (vx)  b_v   _v [x; -
]
 ,  _v [x; - ] P ( i _- ^0 d  v
A (x + v )
),
where  is the eikonal phase of a heavy quark in the
fundamental representation of the  and  amputates this quark inside
the heavy meson. Applying similar transformation to the quark field in the final
state meson 
, one obtains the following expression for the form factor
 
with  standing for the light
component of the meson with the amputated heavy quark. Here the net effect of
nonperturbative interaction with the light component of the heavy meson is
accumulated only via the Wilson line
(Representing the "brown-muck" of the heavy meson by a wave
function 
, the transition of the light cloud from the initial to the
final state can be described by an exact light-quark propagator in an
external gluon field. In this manner the Isgur-Wise form factor will be
rewritten as a correlation function of Wilson loop along the contour formed
by the straight-line trajectories of heavy quarks and the phase of the light
spectator quark in the world-line expression of its propagator.) 
evaluated along the contour consisting of two rays that run along the meson
velocities  and . It is important to notice that the contour
has a cusp at the point , in which the interaction with the external probe
has occurred.

The Isgur-Wise form factor  is a nonperturbative observable in QCD.
It depends on hadronic, long-distance scales as well as on the ultraviolet
cut-off , which sets up the maximal energy of soft gluons. Although
 can not be calculated at present in QCD from the first principles,
its dependence on  can be found from the renormalization group equation
 
where  is the QCD coupling constant and
 is the cusp anomalous dimension
. To the lowest order in 
 
where  is the Casimir operator of the  group
in the fundamental representation. The two-loop correction to GammaCusp  has
been calculated in and its dependence on  is more involved.

Eq. RG  follows from renormalization properties of the Wilson
line in the right-hand side of W . It acquires the anomalous
dimension due to the presence of a cusp on the integration
contour. The cusp anomalous dimension 
  determines universal features of soft-gluon
radiation and is known as the QCD bremsstrahlung function .
As such, it is a positive definite function of the cusp angle (for
real Minkowski angle ) at arbitrary value of the coupling
constant
 _cusp  (; _s)
0.
To see this we recall that at the cusp point the heavy quark
suddenly changes its velocity from  to  and, due to
instantaneous acceleration, it starts to emit  soft (virtual and
real) gluons with momentum  with a cut-off .
Denoting the eikonal phase of the heavy quark as 

 and using its unitarity, one calculates the total probability
for the heavy quark to undergo the scattering (the Bjorken sum
rule) as
1
=
 M (v)  ^  M (v) 
=
()^2
+
_X

M _X(v')   M (v) 
^2
 ,
where in the right-hand side we inserted the decomposition of the unity operator
over the physical hadronic states and separated the contribution of the ground
state meson, , from excited states
. The Wilson line W  defines the probability of the
elastic transition,  with 
. For , depending on
the sign of , it either vanishes or
goes to infinity for . In order to preserve the unitarity
condition  that follows from unitarity , one has to require
that  for  leading to pos . At  the
cusp vanishes, that is the heavy meson stays intact, the sum in unitarity 
equals zero and . This implies that the cusp anomalous
dimension vanishes for .


Parton distributions at  


Our second example is provided by deeply inelastic scattering of a hadron 
with momentum  off a virtual photon  with momentum 
 in the exclusive limit , i.e.
when the invariant mass of the final state system becomes small 
. In the scaling limit, , the cross
section of the process is expressed in terms of the twist-two
quark distribution function, see also Ref.
,
 
describing the probability to find a quark inside the hadron with the fraction
 of its momentum . The Wilson line stretched in between the quark fields
makes the bilocal operator gauge invariant. It goes along the light-like
direction , so that  and
.

The matrix  in CollinearPDFs  serves to select the
quark states with opposite helicities. For our purposes, we will not specify
 and treat it as a free parameter. The Mellin moments of the
distribution function CollinearPDFs  are related to the matrix elements of
local twist-two operators
 
where  is a covariant derivative. Their
dependence on the ultraviolet cut-off  is described by an evolution
equation, whose solution reads in terms of the anomalous dimensions
 
where we assumed for simplicity that the coupling constant does not run, 
. The anomalous dimension of the twist-two operators, 
, depends on the choice of the matrix . In particular,
in case when  selects the same helicities of the quark fields in O ,
, the anomalous dimension is
 
where  is the Euler
psi-function and  is the Euler constant. For other
choices of , the anomalous dimensions have extra
(rational in ) terms in addition to the -function, see,
e.g.,. As we will argue below, Eq.
psi-func  has a hidden symmetry which is responsible for
integrability of evolution equations for three-quark (baryonic)
composite operators. Going over to the  SUSY
Yang-Mills theory, one finds that the same expression
psi-func  defines (up to redefinition of the color factor 
) the anomalous dimensions of multiplicatively
renormalizable twist-two operators.

As follows from O , the asymptotics of the distribution function for
 is related to the contribution of twist-two operators of large
Lorentz spins . One finds from AnomalousDimension 
that the anomalous dimension scales in this limit as
_J  (_s) = _s   C_F

(J+2) + _E  - 3/4 - 1 2 (J+2) 
- _n = 1 ^  B_2n  2n  (J+2)^- 2 n 

+ ,
where 's are the Bernoulli numbers, , ,
and the ellipsis stands for higher order terms in . It turns out that
the leading scaling behavior  is a
universal property of the anomalous dimensions of the twist-two operators O 
for arbitrary . It holds to all orders in  and is
intrinsically related to the cusp anomaly of the Wilson loops. The reason for
this is that analyzing deeply inelastic scattering for  one encounters
the same physical phenomenon as in the case of the Isgur-Wise form factor, i.e.
the struck quark carries almost the whole momentum of the hadron and, therefore,
it interacts with other partons by exchanging soft gluons. In these circumstances,
in complete analogy to the previous case, Eq. Phi-app , the quark field
can be approximated by an eikonal phase evaluated along the classical path in
the direction of its velocity ,
 
where  is the state of the target hadron with
amputated energetic quark and the causal  prescription ensures the correct
spectral property,  for . The -shaped
Wilson line in Eq. () consists out of two rays and one segment:
a link from  to  along the velocity of the incoming quark, next
along the light-cone direction  to the point  and, then,
along  from  to ,
 
Substituting LargeX  into O , one finds the following relation between
the matrix elements of local composite operators at large spin  and the Wilson
loop expectation value  
Here, the large Lorentz spin of the local operator defines the length
of the light-cone segment:
 
We would like to stress that Eq. O-W  holds only for .

According to Eq. O-W , the -dependence of the twist-two operators
follows from the renormalization of the Wilson line W-DIS . The latter has
two cusps located at the points  and . In distinction with the
previous case, one of the segments attached to the cusps lies on the light-cone,
, and the corresponding cusp angle is infinite, 
. In this limit, the cusp anomalous
dimension scales to all orders in  as 
Here  is a universal anomalous dimension
independent on . At weak coupling, it has the following form in QCD
 _cusp (_s)
=
_s  C_F
+
_s   ^2 C_F

N_c 67 36  - ^2 12   - n_f 518 
+
O (_s^3)
,
where  is the number of quark flavors. This expression was obtained
within the dimensional regularization scheme (DREG) by using the
-subtraction procedure, 
.

The divergence of the anomalous dimension light-cusp  for 
indicates that the Wilson line with a light-like segment satisfies an evolution
equation different from RG . The modified equation looks like 
Here the factor of 2 stems from the presence of two cusps on the 
-shaped line contour and  is a process-dependent
anomalous dimension. The explicit dependence of the anomalous dimensions on
the renormalization scale  implies the absence of the multiplicative
renormalizability of the light-like Wilson line. Combining together Eqs.
RG-light  and O-W , we obtain the renormalization group equation for
local composite operators 
at large . Matching its solution into O-sol , we find the asymptotic
behavior of the anomalous dimensions of the twist-two quark operators for

 
Repeating a similar analysis for the twist-two gluon operators, one can show that
their matrix elements satisfy O-W  with the Wilson line defined in the
adjoint representation. Therefore, their anomalous dimension satisfies
gamma-as  upon replacing  leading to _J^(gg)  (_s)
=
N_c C_F   _J^(qq)  (_s)
+
O  (J^0)
 .
In general, the quark and gluon operators mix with each other. However, at large
 the mixing occurs through the exchange of a soft quark with momentum 
. Its contribution to the corresponding anomalous dimensions is suppressed by
a power of  leading to
_J^(gq)  (_s) = O (1/J)
 , _J^(qg)  (_s) = O (1/J)
 .
We would like to stress that the relations gamma-as -off-diag  are valid
to all orders in . Remarkably enough, they hold both in QCD and its
supersymmetric extensions. In the latter case, the mixing matrix has a bigger
size due to the presence of additional scalar fields. Nevertheless, this matrix
remains diagonal at large . Since the fields in supersymmetric YM theories
belong to the adjoint representation, the diagonal matrix elements are the same

=
2 _ab   _cusp (_s) J
+
O (J^0)
 .
with . However, one can not use for
 the two-loop expression
two-loop  at , because it was obtained within the
dimensional regularization scheme which breaks supersymmetry and
also lacks the contribution of possible scalars.


Cusp anomaly in supersymmetric theories 


To calculate  in a supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory, we use the regularization by dimensional reduction (DRED)
. In analogy to compactification, one gets this
scheme by dimensionally reducing the four-dimensional theory down to 
 dimensions. In comparison with the DREG scheme, the Lagrangian
involves now the so-called epsilon-scalars generated by 
components of the four-dimensional gauge field. To two-loop accuracy, these
scalar fields contribute to the Wilson loop by modifying the self-energy of a
gluon at the level of  corrections. The calculation of
the corresponding Feynman diagram is straightforward and details can be found in
the Appendix . It leads to the two-loop correction 
 to
the right-hand side of two-loop , resulting into

comparison with two-loop , we added the contribution of  real
scalars and set  since in a supersymmetic gauge theory fields belong
to the adjoint representation of the . Notice that one can obtain the
same expression two-loop-DR  by expanding two-loop  in powers of the
coupling constant in the dimensional reduction scheme, 
, which is related to the coupling constant in the
dimensional regularization scheme, 
, by a
finite renormalization
(This simple "rule of substitutions" can be understood
by noticing that  governs the scale
dependence of a physical observable, the Isgur-Wise form factor,
and, therefore, it is renormalization scheme invariant.)

Eqs. two-loop  and two-loop-DR  define the cusp anomalous
dimensions in two different renormalization schemes, based on
dimensional regularization and dimensional reduction, respectively.
It is the latter scheme that does not break supersymmetry.

Using gamma-as  and two-loop-DR  we obtain the asymptotic behavior
of the twist-two anomalous dimension in the  scheme
() in
various supersymmetric theories:

 In the  YM theory, one has one Majorana
fermion in the adjoint representation, , and no scalars

 In the  YM theory, one has two Majorana
fermions in the adjoint representation, , and two
real scalar fields in the adjoint representation,

_s N_c   ^2 1-^2 12

 In the  YM theory, one has four Majorana

real scalar fields in the adjoint representation, 
 ^N  = 4 _cusp  (_s)

O (_s^3).
Notice that the two-loop correction to

smaller as one goes from QCD to the  and 
theory and, then, it becomes negative at . We recall that
 for arbitrary , Eq. pos .

Together with Eqs. gamma-as -off-diag , the expressions N1 -N4 
establish the large- asymptotics of the anomalous dimensions of the twist-two
operators in supersymmetric theories. Namely, the matrix of anomalous dimension
is diagonal at large  with the entries on the main diagonal equal to 
. Eq. N1  agrees with the results of
explicit two-loop calculations in Ref. . Eq. N4  is in
disagreement with the
results of Ref. .
(Eq. N4  were in agreement with the results of
Ref.  if one would assume that their result is given in the
 scheme and transforms the coupling constant to the
 scheme via ().)  Eq. N2  is a prediction since
a two-loop calculation in that case has not been performed yet.


Conformal operators and integrable spin chains 


So far we have discussed two-particle composite operators. Let us
now generalize our consideration to operators involving many
fields. Such operators are of great phenomenological interest as
their matrix elements define, e.g., baryon distribution amplitudes
 and higher-twist corrections in various
high-energy processes. To start with, we define first
a framework which solves partially the expected complications in the
mixing problem in this case.


Two-particle conformal operators 


The local twist-two operators  can be obtained from the
expansion of a nonlocal light-cone operator, cf. Eq. (),
 X_1 (0)   _n [0, ]  X_2 (n) 
 _-n  [, 0]  = _J = 0 ^(- i
)^J J!  O _J  (0)  .
Here  denotes a general primary operator
in the gauge theory defined in the adjoint representation of the 
group, "living" on the light-cone  and having definite quantum
numbers with respect to transformations of the conformal group (see
Eq. Moebius  below). The latter condition implies that  can be
identified as the quasi-partonic operator , that is a scalar
field, or a specific component of the quark field and the gluon strength tensor.

Two Wilson lines in gen-fun  run along the light-cone in opposite directions
between the points  and  and ensure the gauge invariance of the operator.
The local twist-two operators  were introduced in the previous
section. Let us reinstate their definition again,
O _J() =  X_1 (n) ( i  n 
D  )^J  X_2 (n) =  X_1 ()
( i )^J  X_2 ()
 ,
where in distinction with the previous case, Eq. O , the covariant derivative
is defined in the adjoint representation, 
. Here in the second relation we have chosen the gauge
 and simplified the notation for the argument of the fields.
The twist-two operators defined in this way are not renormalized multiplicatively
and mix with operators containing total derivatives 
 with 

. Although the mixing can be neglected for forward matrix elements like
CollinearPDFs , it survives in case one considers matrix elements with
different momenta in the initial and final state, or when they are a part of
multi-parton operators. In conformal theories, one can construct linear
combinations of such operators, the so-called conformal operators
, in such a way that they
are renormalized autonomously to all orders in the coupling constant.
(In gauge theories with broken conformal symmetry, like QCD, this
holds only to the lowest order in . Beyond the leading order
's start to mix with . The
corresponding mixing anomalous dimensions are determined solely by the
conformal anomalies, see the last paper of Ref. , Eqs. (51)
and (113) for explicit expressions.)  The mixing between these operators is
protected by the  conformal symmetry of the gauge theory, more
precisely, by its collinear  subgroup, which
acts on the primary fields "living" on the light-cone as follows
a + b c + d 
 , X_i() (c + d)^-2 j_i  X_i a + b c + d  
 ,
with  real such that . Here  is the
conformal spin of the field  equal to one half of the sum of its
canonical dimension, , and projection of the spin onto the light-cone,
. By definition, the conformal operators
 are composite operators built from the primary fields
and satisfying Moebius  with  replaced by . It is easy to see
that the operators O-naive  do not obey the latter condition.

To simplify the analysis, one chooses the axial gauge .
Then, the operators in the left-hand side of gen-fun  are given by the
product of two primary fields. It is transformed under Moebius  in
accordance with the direct product of two  representations
(These are unitary representations of the  group of
the discrete series.)  labelled by the spins  and . Decomposing this
product into the sum of irreducible components, 
, one can identify the spin- component as defining the conformal

one has to substitute . Going

nonlocal light-cone operator over the conformal operators, see, e.g., Refs.

The Lorentz operators  can be re-expressed in terms of the conformal

with the expansion coefficients





which can be calculated in terms of the hypergeometric function . As
was already mentioned, the conformal operators evolve autonomously under
renormalization and their anomalous dimensions have a universal scaling
behavior at large , Eqs. gamma-as  and GKP .

Let us consider the forward matrix element of the both sides of OPE-conf  for
large light-cone separations, . In this limit, typical wavelength of
gluons exchanged between two fields  and  scales as  and
the eikonal approximation Phi-app  is justified. This allows us to replace
the quantum operators  in the left-hand side of OPE-conf  by Wilson
lines in the adjoint representations of the . Then, the left-hand side
of OPE-conf  can be approximated as 
, where the Wilson line in the adjoint representation,
, evaluated along the same
-like contour as in W-DIS . In the right-hand side of
OPE-conf , one can neglect the contribution of operators with total
derivatives since their forward matrix elements vanish. In addition, at large
 the sum is dominated by the contribution of operators with large spin .
In this way,

This relation establishes a correspondence between the Wilson line
in the adjoint representation and the matrix element of the
conformal operator analytically continued to large complex values
of the spin . Notice that in the multi-color limit,
, one has 
 with
 defined in the fundamental
representation.


Multi-particle conformal operators 


Let us generalize the above analysis to conformal operators built from three and
more primary fields. As before, we construct a nonlocal operator containing 
primary (quasi-partonic) fields on the light-cone and expand it in powers of
light-cone separations

X_1(0)  _n [0,_2] X_2(_2) X_N (_N)  _- n  [_N,0]

=
_j_2 j_N 0 
(-i _2)^j_2  j_2!  (-i_N)^j_N  j_N! 
O _j_2j_N (0)
 .
Here the Wilson lines run between two adjacent fields along the light-cone
to ensure the gauge invariance. The local composite operators have the form
O _j_2j_N  ()
=

X_1 () (i n D  )^j_2 
X_2 () (i n D  )^j_N 
X_N ()

 ,
where, as before, the covariant derivative is defined in the adjoint
representation. The evolution of these operators under renormalization group
transformations is much more complicated as compared with the previous case due
to larger number of particles involved and complicated color flow. The latter can
be simplified by going over to the multi-color limit . In this
limit, in the axial gauge , the planar Feynman diagrams
contributing to
the left-hand side of XX  have the topology of a cylinder
(For  the result is exact for arbitrary .)  as shown in
Fig. .

In the multi-color limit, the operators O-N  mix under renormalization among
themselves and with operators containing total derivatives. The mixing occurs
between the operators with the same total conformal spin 
with  and their number grows rapidly with , even for the
forward matrix elements. In the latter case, the dimension of the mixing matrix
scales as  for large . At  this matrix has a single element
for arbitrary . For the number of particles  the problem of
constructing multiplicatively renormalizable operators  is reduced
to diagonalization of the mixing matrix whose size growes with . As we will
argue below, the same problem is equivalent to solving a Schrodinger equation
for a Hamiltonian of a Heisenberg spin chain model. Before doing this, let us
analyze the picture from the point of view of the Wilson line formalism.


Wilson line approach 


Following the Wilson line approach, one can obtain the scaling
behavior of the anomalous dimensions of conformal operators at large spin .
To this end, we examine Eq. XX  for large light-cone separations 
. As in the previous case, the nonlocal
light-cone operator in the left-hand side of XX  is dominated by the
contribution of soft gluons with the wavelength . This allows one
to apply the eikonal approximation and replace the quantum fields by eikonal
phases, the Wilson lines in the adjoint representation evaluated along rays that
run along momenta of particles and terminate at the light-cone. Assuming for
simplicity that all particles have the same momentum  we apply the eikonal
approximation
(Here we used the relation between the eikonal phases defined in the
fundamental () and adjoint () representations,
.)

where  is the annihilation operator of the -th
particle and 
. Then, the matrix element of the operator entering the left-hand side of
XX  between the vacuum and the -particle state 
 is given in the
multi-color limit by (see Fig. )
W_  [_1,_2] 
W_  [_2,_3] 
W_  [_N,_1] 
^- i (p n)(_2 + + _N) 
 ,
with  and . (In arriving at this
relation we applied the "vacuum dominance" property, 
.) Here 
 is the Wilson line in the fundamental representation evaluated along the
-like contour that runs along the momentum  from 
 to the point , then along the light-cone to 
and returns to infinity along . Due to the presence of two cusps on the
integration contour,  acquires the
cusp anomalous dimension 
. In this
way, one finds from prod-W  that the left-hand side of XX  scales as
^- N  _cusp (_s)
[- i (p n)]  ^- i (p n) (_2 + + _N) 
 .
Let us now examine the scaling behavior of the right-hand side of XX . As
before, for large light-cone separations, , the sum is dominated by
the contribution of terms with , or
equivalently . The corresponding composite operator
 is renormalized multiplicatively and has the
anomalous dimension
_J^(max)  = N  _cusp (_s) J
 .
We recall that this result was obtained in the multi-color limit
 for .

Anomalous dimensions of the particle conformal operators are defined as
eigenvalues of the mixing matrix. As we argue in the next section, they can be
parameterized by the set of  nonnegative integers
 such that 
. Their total number equals the
size of the matrix and grows at large  as . For given
spin , the possible values of the anomalous dimensions occupy
the band
_J^(min) 
_J _1,_N-2  
_J^(max)   .
Eq. gamma-max  sets up the upper bound in the spectrum of the
anomalous dimensions.

We recall that gamma-max  was obtained from the analysis of
the nonlocal operator in the left-hand side of XX  at large
light-cone separations between the fields. To establish the lower
bound in bounds , one has to relax the latter condition by
allowing two or more fields to be closely located on the
light-cone. It is convenient to choose the axial gauge
 and consider
 in the
region  and  with
. The fields  and  are separated along
the light-cone by a (relatively) short distance. They interact
with each other by exchanging particles with short wavelengths,
thus invalidating the eikonal approximation. At the same time, the
interaction of these two fields with the remaining fields still
occurs through soft gluon exchanges. Since the soft gluons with
the wavelength  can not resolve the fields  and
, they couple to their total color charge. This means
that one can replace the bilocal operator  by
its expansion over the two-particle conformal operators
 and apply the eikonal approximation
to  and remaining fields
 afterwards. Repeating the analysis
one arrives at the same expression as prod-W  with the only
difference that the factor 
 is missing. As a consequence, the anomalous dimension of
the nonlocal light-cone operator is given at large  by
gamma-max  with  replaced by . In other words, the
coefficient in front of 
in Eq. gamma-max  counts the number of fields separated along
the light-cone by large distances .

This suggests that the minimal anomalous dimension in bounds 
corresponds to the configuration when all fields in the left-hand
side of XX  are grouped into two clusters on the light-cone
located at the points  and , respectively,
leading to
_J^(min)  = 2  _cusp (_s) J
 ,
in agreement with the results of
Refs. . In this
case, the right-hand side of XX  receives contribution from the whole tower
of spin- conformal operators with the anomalous dimensions satisfying
bounds . Going over to the limit , one finds that the
right-hand side of XX  receives dominant contribution from the operators with
minimal anomalous dimension given by gamma-min .

As a function of large spin , the anomalous dimensions 
 form the family of (non-intersecting)
trajectories labelled by the integers . Since the width
of the band bounds  scales as , while the total number of anomalous
dimensions  grows as a power of , one
obtains that for  the distribution of the trajectories inside the band
can be described by a continuous function whose explicit form depends on the
coupling constant.  Going over from the weak to the strong coupling one finds
that the trajectories do not intercept as  increases although their
distribution inside the band bounds  is modified.


Hamiltonian approach to evolution equations 


The above analysis relies on the properties of Wilson loops. Let us now develop a
"dual" picture based on the properties of conformal operators. In the
multi-color limit, the conformal operators are given by linear combinations of
composite operators O-N  including the operators with total derivatives. As
was already discussed above, to construct -particle conformal operators, one
has to decompose the tensor product of  representations of the
 group labelled by conformal spins, , of the
fields  and project out the nonlocal operator XX  onto the spin-
representation
[j_1] [j_2] [j_n]
=
_J0  [J + j_1 + j_2 + + j_N]
 .
Subsequently applying the rule for the sum of two  spins,
, one finds
that the spin- representation has a nontrivial multiplicity 
. It is uniquely specified by the "external" conformal
spins  and "internal" spins 
 with  defining the total
spin in the -channel. Each irreducible spin- component gives
rise to the following local composite operator
O  _J^j  ()
=
P_J^j  (i_1,,i_N)

X_1 (_1) X_2 (_2) X_N (_N)
__1 = = _N =  
 ,
where  and 
 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree  in momentum
fractions . This polynomial is the highest weight vector of the
spin-  representation of the discrete series. It
satisfies the system of differential equations
&&L_1 ++L_k  ^2 P_J^j 
=
J_12k  (J_12k  - 1)P_J^j 
 , (k = 2,,N)
 ,


&&L_1 ^+++L_N ^+  P_J^j  = 0,
with
 and 
. Here  are the
 generators in the "momentum" representation
L_k^- = - x_k
 , L_k^+ = 2 j_k _x_k  + x_k _x_k ^2
 , L_k^0 = j_k + x_k _x_k 
 ,
with . At  the solution to P-system 
is given by Jacobi polynomials (see Eq. Conf-op ). For higher , it can
be constructed iteratively as a product of the  solutions
.
(One can obtain the same expression by subsequently applying the
fusion rules OPE-conf  to the product of  primary fields.) 

The operators O-basis  are transformed under the  conformal
transformations as primary fields with the same conformal spin .
However, they do not have autonomous evolution and mix under renormalization with
each other. To construct multiplicative conformal operators, one has to
diagonalize the corresponding  mixing matrix. Its eigenstates
define the coefficients  of the expansion of the conformal
operators over the basis O-basis  and the corresponding eigenvalues provide
their anomalous dimensions

 ,
where the subscript  with 
 enumerates different conformal operators, or equivalently homogenous
polynomials 
.

Thus, in distinction with the  case, the conformal symmetry alone does not
allow one to construct multiplicatively renormalizable conformal operators for
. Nevertheless, it reduces the problem to diagonalizing the mixing
matrix of dimension . This matrix has a number of remarkable properties.
To begin with, we notice that the homogenous polynomials entering O-basis 
are orthogonal to each other with respect to the  scalar product
J,jJ',j' 
_0^1 [d^N x] x_1^2j_1-1  x_N^2j_N-1 
P_J^j  (x_1,,x_N) P_J' ^j'  (x_1,,x_N)
_JJ' _jj' 
 ,
where  and integration goes
over . This follows from the fact that the 
generators L's  are self-adjoint operators on the vector space endowed with
the scalar product scal-prod . Then, the mixing matrix can be interpreted as
a Hamiltonian acting on the Hilbert space scal-prod , 
. Denoting ,
one can determine the anomalous dimensions of the conformal operators
 as solutions to the -particle Schrodinger equation
H _NJ,  = _J() J, 
under additional (highest weight) condition for its eigenstates
L_tot ^+ J,  = 0
 , L_tot ^0 J,  = (J + _k = 1 ^N j_k) J, 
 ,
with  being the total conformal
spin. The Hamiltonian  commutes with the total 
spin,  and
is a self-adjoint operator on the Hilbert space scal-prod . This ensures that
the anomalous dimensions  take real values.

In perturbation theory, the Hamiltonian  can be obtained from
explicit calculation of Feynman diagrams in the multi-color limit 
 . To the lowest order in , due to cylinder-like topology of the
planar diagrams, the interaction occurs only between nearest neighbors (see Fig.
)

where the two-particle Hamiltonian  acts on the "coordinates"
 and  only.
(We recall that  has the meaning of the momentum fraction
carried by the particle described by the field .)  Conformal
invariance implies that  depends on the sum of two 
spins

2(j_2 x_1 - j_1 x_2) (_1 - _2) + (j_1 + j_2)(j_1 + j_2 - 1)
 ,
where . The general expression for
 looks like
H_k,k+1  = (J_k,k+1 ) +  ,
where  is the Euler psi-function. Here ellipses
denote additional, rational in  terms which are subleading for
. In distinction with the first term in the right-hand side of
H-2-particle , they depend on the type of particles involved.

The two-particle Hamiltonian H-2-particle  has a universal form for large
spins 
H_k,k+1 =J_k,k+1  + O ((J_k,k+1 )^0).
At  the Hamiltonian H_N  equals 
 and its eigenvalues, 
 for , define the anomalous dimension of the
two-particle conformal operator at weak coupling, Eq. gamma-as . To find
the spectrum of anomalous dimension for , one has to solve the
Schrodinger equation Sch  for the -particle Hamiltonian H_N .
It turns out the quantum-mechanical system with the Hamiltonian Sch 
possesses a hidden symmetry and is intrinsically related to Heisenberg
spin magnets.

We would like to emphasize that the equivalence between evolution equations and
dynamical Hamiltonian systems is a rather general phenomenon in Yang-Mills
theories. In particular, similar integrable structures appear in the Regge
asymptotics with the evolution "time" being the logarithm of the
energy scale 
 and in the low-energy behavior of the  effective action
with the "time" .


Heisenberg spin chains 


Let us substitute H-2-particle  into H_N  and define the following
Hamiltonian
H _N^quan =
_s N_c  _k=1 ^N (J_k,k+1 ),
with . Notice that, in general, it differs from the
exact QCD Hamiltonian H_N  by terms that vanish for .
Therefore one should expect that in spite of the fact that the fine structure of
the energy spectrum of two Hamiltonians may be different, their asymptotic
behavior for  is the same. Exact calculations at  confirm such
expectations. The
main advantage of dealing with H-eff  is that the Hamiltonian H-eff 
possesses a set of integrals of motion, ,
[H _N^quan , q_n] = [q_n, q_m] = 0  ,
and, as a consequence, the Schrodinger equation for 
turns out to be completely integrable
. The Hamiltonian
H-eff  is well-known in the theory of integrable models. It has been
constructed in as a generalization
of the celebrated spin- XXX Heisenberg magnet to higher spin representations
of the  and  groups.

Eq. H-eff  defines periodic Heisenberg spin chain model of length  and
spins being the  generators. The value of the spin at the
-th site is given by the conformal spin of the corresponding primary field.
Such identification allows one to solve the spectral problem for the Hamiltonian
H-eff  exactly by the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method
. In particular,
using the Lax operator for the XXX Heisenberg spin magnet
L _k(u)
=

 
 
with  and  being the  generators L's , one
can obtain the explicit form of the integrals of motion  from
the expansion of the transfer matrix  in powers of the spectral parameter

t_N(u)
=
[ L _1(u) L _2(u)L _N(u) ]
=
2 u^N + q_2 u^N - 2  + + q_N
 ,
with  depending on the
total spin of the system . Due to complete integrability of the model, the
energy spectrum is uniquely specified by their eigenvalues, 
. Applying the Bethe Ansatz
, one can
calculate explicitly both the energy spectrum and the corresponding
eigenfunctions. We recall that the former defines the anomalous dimensions of
conformal operators, while the latter determine the polynomials 
 entering general-O .

For our purposes, we are interested in finding the large  asymptotic
behavior of the energy spectrum. Assuming for simplicity that the
particles have the same  spin, 
 one obtains the following asymptotic expression for the energy
_J ()
=
_s N_c

_k = 1 ^N (j + i _k) + _E 
]
+

 ,
where  are roots of the transfer matrix t-N , 
. According to t-N , the quantum numbers  are
given by symmetric polynomials of degree  in .
For  one finds that the roots are real and they scale differently with
 in the upper and lower part of the spectrum. In the upper part of the
spectrum, all roots scale as  with  leading
to 
_J^(max) 
=
_s N_c    _1_2_N 
=
_s N_c   q_N = N _s N_c  J  .
In the lower part of the spectrum, 
and  for  (notice that  due to
absence of the term in the right-hand side of t-N ). This leads
to  and
_J^(min) 
=
_s N_c    _1 _2 
=
2 _s N_c  J
 .
We observe a perfect agreement of these expressions with Eqs. gamma-max  and
gamma-min  obtained within the Wilson line approach.

In the Wilson line approach, the asymptotic behaviour of the anomalous
dimensions, Eqs. gamma-max  and gamma-min  is tied to the scaling scaling
behaviour of the two-particle spins  while in the Hamiltonian approach
Eqs. Gamma-up  and Gamma-down  follow from similar behaviour of the roots
 of the transfer matrix t-N . Let us demonstrate that
 at large .

By the definition,  is the sum of two  spins. Its
eigenvalues satisfy , where  is the total
spin of  particles. Since , one can not
assign a definite value of  to the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian
. Nevertheless, for  the system of  particles
approaches a quasiclassical regime in which quantum fluctuations are frozen and
the spins  can be treated as classical variables. To see this one
notices that for quantum-mechanical systems defined by the Hamiltonian H-eff 
the "effective" Planck constant equals unity, , and the energy scale
is defined by the total spin . This suggests that for 
 one can solve the Schrodinger equation
Sch  by the WKB methods .

In the WKB approach, one looks for the solution to Sch  in the form
J, P_J, (x_1,,x_N) = i  
S_0(x)+ i S_1(x) + O () ,
where . To find the functions , 
, , one requires that the wave function WKB  has to be an
eigenstate of the transfer matrix t-N , or equivalently diagonalize
simultaneously the integrals of motion . In this way, one obtains
that the leading term  satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi equations in
the underlying classical system, while subleading terms can be  expressed in
terms of . To go over to the classical limit, one applies the
operator of the two-particle spin defined in Jk  to the WKB wave function
WKB 
^2(L_k + L_k+1 )^2 ^iS_0/ 
=

x_k x_k+1  (p_k-p_k+1 )^2 + O ()

^iS_0/ 
 ,
where we have restored in the left-hand side the dependence on the Planck
constant and  is a classical momentum
of the -th particle. In a similar manner, the  spin
operators L's  can be replaced by classical functions on the phase space
of  particles
L_k, cl ^- = -x_k
 , L_k, cl ^+ = - x_k p_k^2
 ,L_k, cl ^0 = i x_k p_k
 .
Notice that the dependence on a single-particle spin disappears since
. One verifies that, in agreement with WKB-L2 ,
(L_k, cl  + L_k+1, cl )^2
=
(J_k,k+1 ^cl )^2
=
x_k x_k+1  (p_k - p_k+1 )^2
 .
Here  defines the classical limit of the two-particle spin
. Then, replacing  in
H-eff , one expands the Hamiltonian  in powers of
 and identifies the leading term of the expansion as the Hamiltonian of
the classical model
H _N^cl 
=
_s N_c 2 _k=1 ^N
J_k,k+1 ^cl  ^2
 .
Remarkably enough, this Hamiltonian inherits integrability properties of
the quantum model. It contains a set of integrals of motion 

 H _N^cl , q_k^cl  
=
 q_n^cl , q_k^cl  
=
0
 ,
with the Poisson bracket defined as
.  To
obtain their explicit form, one replaces the  spin operators
in Lax  by their classical counterparts L-class  and substitutes the
resulting expression for the Lax operator into t-N . This leads to
q_n^cl 
=
_1j_1 < < j_nN  x_j_1  x_j_n-1  
x_j_n  (p_j_1 -p_j_2 )
(p_j_n-1  -p_j_n )(p_j_n -p_j_1 ),
with . One observes that 
 and, therefore, the classical Hamiltonian H-class 
can be written as
H _N^cl 
=
_s N_c   q_N^cl 
 .
By construction,  defines a classical limit of the
Heisenberg  spin magnet model. Evaluating 
 along the orbits of classical motion of  particles, one obtains the
energy spectrum of the quantum magnet to the leading order of the WKB expansion,
or equivalently the large- behavior of the anomalous dimensions
 of conformal operators, Eq. Sch . According to
H-asym , this behavior is controlled by the large- scaling of the
"highest" integral of motion . In the WKB approach, the
spectrum of  is obtained by imposing the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization
conditions on the periodic orbits of classical motion of 
particles . As was shown in Ref.
, the WKB spectrum of anomalous
dimensions derived in this manner is in agreement with the exact expressions
Gamma-up  and Gamma-down .

Finally, let us establish the relation between the roots  of the
transfer matrix and the two-particle spins . Substituting
 into t-N  one obtains that the roots
parameterize the eigenvalues of the integrals of motion . At large ,
replacing  by their classical counterparts defined in qn-class , one
finds that  are given by symmetric polynomials in
 of degree  (with 
). Therefore, the large- behavior of the momenta 
 and the roots  are in one-to-one correspondence with each
other. In particular, in the upper part of the spectrum, Eq. Gamma-up , one
gets from  that , or equivalently
 for . In similar manner, in the lower
part of the spectrum, Eq. Gamma-down ,  leads to
 and . We recall that the
-variables  entering J-class  have the meaning of momentum fractions
carried by  particles described by quantum fields . Then,
conjugated to them the -variables are the light-cone coordinates of the same
fields, . Thus, in the upper and the lower part of the spectrum
one has  and , respectively.
These properties are in agreement with the results obtained in section
 within the Wilson line approach.

We notice that the anomalous dimensions of particle conformal operators,
Eq. Gamma-up  and Gamma-down , were obtained using the lowest-order
expression for the QCD evolution kernels whereas Eqs. gamma-max  and
gamma-min  hold to all orders in the coupling constant. The above analysis
suggests that at large  the higher order corrections modify the classical
Hamiltonian H-class  and H-asym  in the following way
H _N^cl 
=
1 2   _cusp (_s)
_k = 1 ^N J_k,k+1 ^cl  ^2
=
 _cusp (_s)q_N^cl 
 ,
with  and  given by the same expressions
as before, Eqs. J-class  and qn-class , respectively.


Cusp anomaly at weak coupling 


Let us revisit the computation of the cusp anomalous dimension to the lowest
order of perturbation theory aiming on an analogy with the stringy computation
of Wilson loops within the AdS/CFT framework. As we will see momentarily, the
cusp anomaly in the weak coupling regime can be interpreted as a quantum 
transition amplitude for a test particle propagating in the radial time 
and the angular coordinate . This should be compared with the strong
coupling calculation , in which the same quantity
is given by a classical  action function for a particle propagating on
the same phase space.


Cusp anomaly in perturbation theory 


To the lowest order in the coupling constant, the Wilson line expectation value
is given by
W = P i _  dx_A^(x)  = 1 + (ig)^2 2  t^a
t^a
_C dx__C dy_ D^ (x - y) + O (g^4)
 ,
where  is a
gluon propagator and  is the Casimir operator in the adjoint
representation of the . To calculate the cusp anomaly we choose the
integration contour , see Fig.  (left), to be the same as for
the Isgur-Wise form factor, Eq. W . In this way, we obtain
W (vv')
=
1 - _s N_c   ( w (vv') - w(1) )
+
O (_s^2)
 ,
where  and  are tangents to the integration contour in the
vicinity of the cusp, , ,
 and
w (vv')
=
^0_-  d s _0^d t v  v' ( v s - v' t )^2 
 ,
with  and  being proper times. Going over to higher orders in ,
one takes into account that the Wilson loop possesses the property of non-abelian
exponentiation  
where the weights  receive contribution from diagrams to the -th order
in  with maximally nonabelian color structure. In our case, the
exponentiation property states that .

cut-offs, respectively. Combining together one-loop  and
WinTermsOfChebyshev , one verifies that the Wilson line satisfies the
evolution equation RG .

Eqs. Chebyshev  and WinTermsOfChebyshev  have a simple interpretation
within the radial quantization approach. In this
formalism, one performs a quantization procedure using four-dimensional
(Euclidean) polar coordinates  and . This allows
one to separate the dynamics in the radial and angular coordinates by decomposing
the propagators of fields over partial waves defined as eigenstates of the
operator of the angular momentum
L ^2 = 18 l^ l_   , l_  =
i x__ ,
which has the meaning of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a sphere .
Then, in the radial quantization the lowest order contribution to the cusp
anomaly, Eq. WinTermsOfChebyshev , takes the factorized form  
where  denotes a point on the (hyper)sphere  defined by
the unit vector  and additional minus sign inside  takes into
account that two tangents have opposite orientation at the cusp. Thus at the
weak coupling, the cusp anomalous dimension is given by
 _cusp  (; _s)
=
- _s N_c 2  
(
- v'  1/L ^2  v -
v 1/L ^2  v )
+
O (_s^2)
.
Let us demonstrate that the matrix elements entering this expression coincide
with the propagator of a test particle on the time-like hyperboloid
.


Particle propagation on a sphere 


To avoid complications due to the infinite volume of the (noncompact)
 group manifold, we will calculate the propagator of a particle
on a unit sphere  and perform an analytic continuation from Euclidean to
Minkowski signatures afterwards.

 Transition amplitude on a sphere between two
points  and  with  and
 (left). Classical trajectories which saturate the amplitude
are multiple windings around the sphere over principles circles, e.g., 
trajectories (right), separated from each other for illustration purposes only.  

The transition amplitude for the particle on the  sphere to go from the
point  to  is equal to the sum over all paths  connecting
these two points, Fig. ,
G[v,-v'] = _P S^3  ^-iA[P] 
 ,
where summation goes over connected paths  of the lenght  on the
 sphere. With an arbitrary point on the sphere, , one
can associate an element of the  group
g_v = v_0 + i_a = 1 ^3 v_a _a
 ,  [ g^-1 _v_1  g^1  _v_2  ] = 2 (v_1 v_2)
 ,
with  being Pauli matrices. Eq. part-fun  defines a quantum
dynamics of a particle on the  group manifold. Introducing local
(angular) coordinates on the sphere 
v_0 = ,v_1 = ,v_2 = ,v_3 = ,
one obtains the metric on this manifold as
ds^2
=
1 2  [ g_v^-1  d g^1  _v ]^2
=
- d ^2 - ^2  d ^2 - ^2  d ^2
G_MN (X) dX^M dX^N
 .
The action of a particle has the meaning of the length of the path on this
manifold
A[P]
=
_0^1 d- G_MN (X) _X^M _X^N 
=
_0^1 d
e() 4 
-
1 e()  G_MN (X) _X^M _X^N 

 ,
where  is a local coordinate on the trajectory. The two expressions
coincide upon extremizing with respect to the einbein field .

Following, for instance, , one can express this path integral as an integral over
the proper time  of the matrix element of
the transition operator
G[v, - v']
=
- i _0^d -v' ^iH   v 
=
-v'  1/H   v  .
Here the Hamiltonian  is the Laplace-Beltrami operator
on the . It defines a quantum-mechanical model (symmetric top) with the
 dynamical symmetry. Since the Hamiltonian coincides with the Casimir
operator of this group, its eigenstates correspond to unitary irreducible
 representations of spin 
H  Y^j _m_1 m_2  (g)
=
j(j + 1) Y^j _m_1m_2  (g)
 , Y^j _m_1m_2  (g)
=
(2j + 1)^1/2  d^j_m_1m_2  (g)
,
where , the matrix elements of the
spin- group representation , are the well-known
Wigner functions. The transition matrix element can be expanded
over characters of the  representation
- v' ^iH   v 
&=&
_j = 0, 12, 1,  
(2j + 1)
[ d^j (g_-v' ^-1 ) d^j (g^1  _v) ]
^i j(j + 1) 


&=&
_j = 0, 12, 1,   (2j + 1)
_j [g_-v' ^-1  g_v^1  ] ^i j(j + 1) 
 .
Here, the  character is defined as_j [g_v]
=
_m = - j ^j d^j_mm  (g_v)
=
(2j + 1) /2  /2 
 ,
where the Euler angle is defined as  with
 given by g_n  leading to . Substituting
chi  into vev-1  and making use of the second relation in g_n , one
calculates the matrix element entering G  as
-v' ^iL ^2  v 
=
_j = 0, 1 2 , 1, 
(2j + 1) ^i j(j + 1)  
((2j + 1) )  
 ,
where  is the angle between the vectors 
and . Substituting theta  into G , one notices that the
 term in theta  leads to a divergent contribution upon integration
in the right-hand side of G . It does not depend, however, on the cusp
angle  and cancels in the difference  leading to
 _cusp  (; _s)
=
- _s N_c 2   ( G[v, - v'] - G[v, v] )
=
_s N_c   - 1 
 ,
where  is the Euclidean cusp angle .
Going over to Minkowski space, we continue  and reproduce
the correct expression for the cusp anomalous dimension, Eq. GammaCusp ,
upon identification of the Casimirs .

The following comments are in order. The sum in theta  can be
expressed, via the Poisson summation formula, as a derivative of Jacobi
theta functions, namely,
* 
where  and .
One can rewrite the same expression as
-v' ^iL ^2 v 
&=&
- 2 1   (-i )^-3/2 
_= - ^(+ 2 )
^-i (+ 2 )^2/- i /4 


&=& 1   (-i )^-1/2 
   
_= -  ^^-i (+ 2 )^2/- i /4 
 .
Eq. vev-dual  has a remarkably simple physical meaning.
As was shown in, see also Refs.
, the semiclassical expression for the transition
amplitude on the  group manifold coincides with the exact solution,
Eq. vev-dual , i.e. the path integral collapses from a sum over all
paths to a sum over classical paths. In the semiclassical approach, the
right-hand side of vev-dual  comes about as a sum over classical
trajectories "dressed" by quadratic fluctuations. The classical trajectories
are geodesics and run along the principal circle on the unit sphere between
the two points,  and , and wrap around this circle -times
in the (anti-)clockwise direction depending on the sign of . The
trajectories fall into two homotopy classes depending on the -parity.
Denoting  the angular variable on this circle, one can
parameterize classical trajectories as 
 with . The metric metric 
on the classical trajectories equals
ds^2 = G_MN  dX^M dX^N = -d^2
and the classical action action  is given in the gauge 
 by
A_cl [P]
=
_0^d14  + ()^2 
=
 4 + 1 (+ 2 )^2
 .
Coming back to the original sum part-fun , we conclude that
the exact expression for the transition amplitude vev-dual ,
and as a consequence the cusp anomalous dimension G0 , is
given by the sum over classical trajectories. This property of the
path integral is a manifestation of the Duistermaat-Heckman
"localization" phenomenon in quantum dynamical systems on Lie
groups. 

The derivation of theta  was based on the identification of the unit sphere
 as the  group manifold. Going over from Euclidean to Minkowski
kinematics, one has to substitute the sphere  by the time-like hyperboloid
, or equivalently the -dimensional Lobachevsky space AdS. The
appropriate group manifold is provided by the  coset. In
distinction with the previous case, the dynamical symmetry group is noncompact
and we have to deal with quantum mechanics on the space of constant negative
curvature. The analysis goes along the same line as above with the only
difference that the  representations of spin- have to be substituted
by the unitary, continuous representations of the  group:
 
fundamental series:  with 
complementary series: 
It turns out that the resulting expression can be obtained from theta 
through analytical continuation in spin . To see this, one applies the
Barnes-Mellin transformation to rewrite the sum over half-integer  in
theta  as a contour integral over the complex spin that runs parallel
to the imaginary axis to the right from 
G[v, - v'] - G[v,v]
=
- _- i  ^+ i   dj 2i 
 (2j) 
(2j + 1)^2 j(j+  1) 

((2j + 1)) (2j + 1)  - 1

.
with . One verifies that moving the integration contour to the
right and picking up the residues at half-integer  one reproduces the known
expression for the  propagator, Eq. G0 . Let us now move the
integration contour in G1  to the left parallel to the imaginary axis until
it reaches . Since the integrand has a pole at , the
deformed contour will contain an additional addendum that encircles the segment
 on the real axis. Changing the integration variable as 
 and going over to Minkowski kinematics, , one
finds
G[v, - v'] - G[v, v]
=
_- ^+  12 _  
d 2(1 + ^2) 
() () 
 .
Here in the second integral we made use of the symmetry of the integrand under 
 and extended the integration to the contour , which encircles
the segment  in the anticlockwise direction. The two integrals in the
right-hand side of G2  describe the contribution of the fundamental and
complimentary series, correspondingly. Since the integrand in G2  is an odd
function of , the former integral vanishes, while the latter is given by the
residue at the poles , or equivalently . The resulting
expression for the propagator G2  coincides with G0  upon replacing
. Similar to the previous case, one can expand the cusp
anomalous dimension as the sum over classical trajectories on the hyperplane
 defined by the time-like vectors  and  in the
AdS space . Since the trajectories do not
"penetrate" into transverse -directions, the sum will be the same if
one changes the metric of the AdS space from Euclidean to Lorentzian
signature, . It is this version of the AdS space that one
encounters in the strong-coupling calculation of the cusp anomaly
.


Analytic structure of cusp anomaly 


Examining G0  one faces a paradox. By definition, 
, the cusp angle is defined up to  with  an
arbitrary integer. At the same, G0  is not invariant under this
transformation indicating that  is a
multivalued  function of the cusp angle. To understand the origin of this
non-analyticity we observe that the sum in theta  diverges at 
, or equivalently . This divergence has a simple meaning in
terms of the sum over random paths on the -sphere, Eq. part-fun . For 
 the minimal length path connecting the points  and
 is unique. For  the points  and  are
opposite poles on the sphere, the length of the minimal path equals  and the
number of such paths is infinite. The same singularity has a clear meaning in QCD
in context of the heavy quark form factor. We recall that  and 
are velocities of the heavy quark before and after interaction with space-like
external momentum , 
. Re-expressing the cusp anomalous dimension
GammaCusp  as a function of ,
 
one finds that the singularity at , i.e. in the non-physical point
, corresponding to . The heavy quark form factor,
analytically continued from  to , describes the threshold
creation of a pair of heavy quarks. For , i.e. above the threshold,
the cusp anomalous dimension acquires an imaginary part.


Cusp anomalous dimension and 2D gauge theory 


In the previous section, we identified the one-loop cusp anomaly with a
transition amplitude for a test particle on the  group
manifold. As a next step, we will express this amplitude in terms of a
disk partition function in a two-dimensional gauge theory and use
the stringy representation of the latter. We will demonstrate that the
emerging stringy description of the cusp anomaly at weak coupling is
different from the one dictated by the Nambu-Goto string.

In two dimensions, the Yang-Mills theory does not contain transverse gauge
degrees of freedom and, therefore, it can be reduced to a quantum-mechanical
model. Its partition function on an arbitrary Euclidean two-dimensional
manifold  of genus  with the metric tensor  can be
calculated through the heat kernel expansionZ  [g^2 A ]
=
D A_
^
- 1 g^2  _  d^2x g_   F^2
 
=
_R  (R)^2 - 2G  ^- g^2 A   C_2(R)/2 
 ,
where  is the only nontrivial component
of the strength tensor  with generators in the
fundamental representation normalized as 
.  is the area of the target manifold
. The sum in the right-hand side of
() runs over the unitary representations
 of the gauge group of dimension  and quadratic Casimir
. As in section , we will consider
the  gauge group and perform analytical continuation to the
 group afterwards. In that case, 
 and  with  being non-negative
(half)integer. Then, the sum in Z-2D  has a striking
resemblance with a similar sum defining the transition amplitude
vev-1 .

To make the correspondence exact, one introduces the amplitude of the
two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory on a disk, with radial coordinate ,
, and angular , , of area
, and a holonomy at its boundary ,
* 
The partition function of the disk is 
where and  is its characters for the spin- representation
of the gauge group. The path integral representation is due to Ref.
, where the conjugation invariant delta function
(It equates the eigenvalues of two unitary matrices.)  is defined
by a group Fourier transform 
. The disk transition amplitude () is used
to build the ones for arbitrary manifolds of genus  by a gluing procedure
. Eq. () reduces to the partition function
via () by . Thus,
Z  [U; g^2 A  = 2 ]
=
-v' ^- H   v 
 ,
c.f. Eq. (), where  and
 with 
 .
Thus, the one-loop cusp anomalous dimension G0  is given by the integral
of the wave functional in two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory on the disc with
respect to its area
 _cusp  (; _s)
=
-
_s N_c 2  
_0^d (
Z  [U; 2 ] - Z  [; 2 ]
)
 .
As we have already mentioned, the transition amplitude of the particle on the
 group manifold has two different representations, Eqs. theta  and
vev-dual . The first one coincides with Z-1 . While the second one is
related to the  saturation of
the partition function on a Riemann surface by a sum over classical saddle
points in the path integral (see also), -  a
consequence of the Duistermaat-Heckman localization. It can be rephrased in physical
terms as instanton mechanism of confinement in two-dimensional Yang-Mills
theory. The instantons under consideration are solutions to
the Yang-Mills equations of motion on the two-dimensional disk with the
boundary conditions set by the holonomy 
. The classical configurations in the  gauge
correspond to straight paths connecting the initial and final points and read
in the topological charge- sector 
. The action evaluated on these instanton
solutions reads
* 
and the weight factor  in 
. These properties are in a perfect agreement with our findings
in section , Eq. ().

It is well-known that the two-dimensional  Yang-Mills theory is a string
theory. Its partition function is given by the sum of maps
from two-dimensional worldsheet to two-dimensional target manifold . The
explicit relation between the partition functions in two theories looks as
followsZ  [g^2 A ]
=
Z _str 
[ g_s = 1/N, = 1/(g^2 N) ]
with . Combining together Eqs. cusp=string  and zz , we
conclude that the one-loop cusp anomalous dimension cusp=string  admits the
same stringy representation.

Eq. zz  is a counterpart of the relation between the transition amplitude
of firstly quantized particle and partition function of secondly quantized
field theory. Namely, it relates firstly quantized string with two-dimensional
Yang-Mills theory. According to zz , the partition function in the latter
theory is equal to the transition amplitude in the string theory with the
boundary conditions specified by the holonomy  on the disk
boundary. Moreover, one can establish a one-to-one correspondence between the
gauge invariant states in the Hilbert space of two-dimensional Yang-Mills
theory,  with , and stringy
excitations (the oscillatory modes). The relation between the two looks as
follows [ U^n () ]
 _n + _- n     )
 ,
where the   and
 satisfy the commutation relations 
 and 
 and  is the stringy coherent state
* 
The holonomy  is defined in the fundamental
representation of the  group.
(The closed string
picture for  two-dimensional YM theory is valid
perturbatively only for . However, the stringy
representation exists for arbitrary  .) 

We recall that 
with  given in g_n  so that 
. Notice that  and
the characters  provide two linear independent bases
on the space of invariant functions on the  group and,
therefore, they are related to each other by a linear
transformation, a form of the Frobenius character
formula. This allows one to rewrite Eq. Z-1 
in terms of  and make use of oscillator  in
order to re-express the transition amplitude for a particle on a
cylinder, deduced by gluing the opposite arcs of the boundary
holonomies of the disk amplitude,
 
in terms of a string amplitude
Z  [U (), U (0); 2 ]
=
-v' ^- H   v 
=
(  ^-H _str    = 0 )
 ,
where  corresponds to a trivial holonomy ,
thus resulting merely to a disk amplitude 
. The group theory Hamiltonian
 is not diagonal in the basis spanned by string states and involves
splitting and joining of strings. The string Hamiltonian is defined for the
 group asH _str 
=
2 ( L_0 + L_0 )
+
1 2 ( L_0 - L_0 )^2
+
( V + V )
 ,
where the Virasoro generator and interaction vertex operator read
* 
with  and  given by similar expressions. Substituting
Z=str  into cusp=string  one could obtain the representation for one-loop
cusp anomalous dimension in terms of string propagator
 _cusp  (; _s)
=
- _s N_c 2 
[
(  1/H _str    0 )
-
( 0  1/H _str    0 )
]  .
We would like to stress that the string corresponding to the one-loop cusp anomaly
is not of the Nambu-Goto type. At the same time, the cusp anomaly
at strong coupling is described by the Nambu-Goto string on the AdS background whose
tension scales as  (see next section). Going over from weak
to strong coupling regime one expects to find the transition from the former string
to the latter. The mechanism governing such transition remains unclear. One of
possible scenarios was proposed in Ref. . It is based on the
identification of the two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory Z-2D , rewritten as
* 
as a topological string (for ) perturbed by a rigidity
term. The Nambu-Goto action was conjectured
to arise through the dimensional transmutation mechanism at strong
coupling.

It is worth mentioning on the  relation
of Yang-Mills theory with AdS background. Its appearance can be
understood by noticing that after analytical continuation of the
cusp anomaly from the Euclidean to Minkowski kinematics, one has
to deal with a two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory with the
 gauge group. It is well-knownthat at  such theory is equivalent to topological
Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with the action
 
where  is the dilaton field and  is the cosmological constant.
Solutions to the classical equations of motion give rise to the AdS
gravity coupled to the dilaton.


Cusp anomaly at strong coupling 


The main goal of our previous discussion of the cusp anomaly at
weak coupling was to emphasize its quantum nature as a transition
amplitude for a particle on the AdS space. In this section,
we will argue that at strong coupling the cusp anomaly is given by
Hamilton-Jacobi action function corresponding to a classical
mechanical system defined on the same space.

According to the AdS/CFT correspondence, the
strong coupling regime in gauge theories is related to the supergravity
limit of a string theory on the AdSS background. In the
present discussion we are interested in operators with large angular momentum
 where the conventional (supergravity field)/(Yang-Mills operator)
correspondence is not applicable, and one has to solve the string theory
semiclassically. For the light-cone observables
discussed here, like quark distribution functions CollinearPDFs  and
light-like Wilson loops LargeX , the full conformal QCD group 
is effectively reduced to its collinear subgroup . It is only the
latter which acts non-trivially on the field operators "living" on the
light-cone. The group  is an
isometry of the AdS. Therefore, applying the gauge/string correspondence,
instead of the full AdS space it will be enough to consider only its
AdS subspace.

Let us remind a few elementary facts about anti-de Sitter space. The AdS
space with the Lorentzian signature is a hypersurface embeded in flat

 
We set its radius to be  for simplicity. The  group structure
becomes manifest via the following parametrization
 
with . To parametrize the
hypersurface AdSembedding , we will use two different sets of coordinates
. In the global -coordinates the AdS
space looks like
 
and in local Poincare -coordinates
X_0 + X_1 = u
 , X_2 = u x
 , X_3 = u t
 .
The transformation from one set of coordinates to the other is achieved via
the map
 
For the discussion which follows we introduce the Rindler coordinates on
the conformally flat part  of AdS in Poincare
parametrization
 
The metric on the AdS space in the global coordinates reads, see e.g.,
,
ds^2
=
1 2  ( g^-1  d g )^2
=
- ^2 d ^2 + ^2 d^2 + d ^2
and in the Poincare-Rindler coordinates
ds^2
=
du^2 u^2  + u^2 ( dx^2 - dt^2 )
=
du^2 u^2  + u^2 (-d r^2 + r^2 d ^2 )
 .
Here, the two sets of coordinates have different physical interpretation. In
Eq. ds1 ,  defines the radial coordinate on the AdS space,
 is the azimuthal angle and  sets
up the AdS time. Notice that the latter is different from the time variable in
ds2 . In Eq. ds2 ,  is the Liouville coordinate, 
and  are the time and the spacial coordinates, respectively, on the
hyperplane in Minkowski space to which the contour entering the definition of
the Wilson loop W  (see also Fig. ) belongs to. In the polar
coordinates, choosing  at the cusp, one identifies  in ds2 
as the cusp angle. Since the relation sets  between two sets of the
coordinates is nonlinear, the same trajectory of a test particle on the AdS
space looks differently in the  and  coordinates.

Let us now turn to the analysis of the cusp anomaly in the strong coupling
regime. As was mentioned in section , there are two apparently
different approaches to calculate the cusp anomalous dimension within the gauge/string
correspondence. One of them relies on the relation between the large-
behavior of the anomalous dimensions of twist-two composite operators and cusp
anomaly, Eq. gamma-as . In this way, following, one can
calculate   as the energy minus spin of a
folded closed string rapidly rotating in the AdS space in the 
coordinates, Eq. GKP . In the second approach,
one calculates  from the minimal surface of
the worldsheet of an open string propagating in the AdS space in the 
coordinates with the ends sliding along two rays at the boundary 
with the cusp angle . In both approaches, the result for the
cusp anomaly is expressed in terms of solutions to classical equations of
motion. The main difference between the two cases is the form of the classical
Hamiltonian and underlying picture of classical motion.
(Another difference is that the calculation of Ref. can be performed only in the AdS space with Lorentzian signature, whereas in
the case of the Wilson loop, Refs. , the result
can be reproduced by an analytical continuation from Euclidean space.)  In this
section, we will demonstrate the equivalence between the two approaches.


Open string and Wilson loop 






1mm
 

 
 
 The minimal surfaces swept by open strings
whose ends move along the contour of the Wilson loop. The surface of the
Wilson loop in the adjoint representation (left) is a double of the Wilson
loop in the fundamental representation (right). 

To begin with, we recall the calculation of a Wilson loop with a cusp. The
Nambu-Goto action for a string propagating in the AdS target space looks
like
S = 2  R^2 2
d^2  - G_MN  _a X^M _b X^N  
 ,
where  and  is the metric tensor on the
 space, , Eqs. ds1  and ds2 . The
Wilson loop is defined by a classical configuration that minimizes this action,
. The additional factor  in the right-hand side
of Nambu-Goto  takes into account that the Wilson loop is taken in the
adjoint representation of the  and, in multi-color limit ,
it is just the square of the same loop in the fundamental representation. Also,
the minus sign under the square-root in Nambu-Goto  ensures that  is real
in Minkowski signature.

The main contribution to the cusp anomaly comes from the vicinity of the cusp,
see Fig. . In the Poincare-Rindler 
coordinates the minimal surface can be written asu = f() r   .
Choosing  as local coordinates on the
worldsheet, one finds the induced metric as
G_MN  _a X^M _b X^N
=
(
 
)
 ,
where . Then, the
action becomes
S_min  = 2_s N_c   d r r  d
f ^2 - f^2 + f^4  i _cusp (,_s)r_max   r_min     ,
where the cusp anomalous dimension is given by
 _cusp (; _s)
=
2_s N_c   
_0^d  -f ^2 + f^2 - f^4 
 .
This allows us to interpret 
 as a classical action of a particle with
the Lagrangian ,
where  and  play the role of the coordinate
and the time, respectively. The energy  and momentum
 of the particle take the form
E = f  L [f] f   - L  =
-f^2 + f^4 -f ^2 + f^2 - f^4  
 , P
=
L [f] f  
= -f   -f ^2 + f^2 - f^4  .
Being the integral of motion, , the energy determines the solutions
to the classical equations of motion. The action calculated along classical
trajectory satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and is given by
 _cusp (; _s)
=
2 _s N_c   
_0^d  P() f () - E 
 .
Since the minimal surface ends at the boundary of the AdS space, ,
the classical trajectories have to satisfy the boundary condition 
. As was shown in Refs. , the asymptotic behavior of
the cusp anomaly at large  is governed by the contribution of classical
solutions with the energy . In this
case, the classical trajectory
starts at infinity, , and approaches  as
. Since  vanishes in this
limit, , one finds from cusp-str 
 _cusp (; _s) = _s N_c   
  ,
in agreement with light-cusp  and cusp-strong . The corresponding minimal
surface can be translated into the global coordinates by noticing that 
. Then, one gets from the equation for
AdS embedding (),
 
which is the result of Ref. .


Rotating closed string 


Let us now recapitulate the consideration of a rotating folded closed string in
the AdS space around its center-of-mass following, see
also. In distinction with the previous case, one chooses to
work in the global -coordinates () and assumes that
the center of the string lies at . The string action is given by the
same Nambu-Goto expression Nambu-Goto  but with different boundary
conditions. Choosing the gauge  and , one
finds the induced metric as
G_MN  _a X^M _b X^N
=
(
 
)  ,
where  is an azimuthal angle of a point on the string
with the AdS time and radial coordinates,  and , respectively,
and  the corresponding angular
velocity. As a consequence, the action of the rotating stretched string looks
like
S
=
4  R^2 2
d _0^_0  d
^2-  ^2() ^2  
d  L  []
 .
Here the additional factor  counts the number of segments of the folded string
rotating around  and the maximal radial coordinate  is
determined by
^2-  ^2() 0
 .
Eq. S-GKP  defines a classical mechanical model of a rotating rod with the
Lagrangian . Its energy and angular momentum are
E
&=&
  L  []

L 
=

 , 

J
&=&
L []   
= - 4 _s N_c   
_0^_0  d   ^2  ^2 -  ^2 ^2  
 .
Both quantities are integrals of motion so that the classical trajectories
are specified by the values of  and . The action S-GKP  evaluated
along the classical trajectory is given by(Note that the pair
 defines the action-angle variables for the system under
consideration.) 
S_cl  =

with  being the angular velocity of the rod. The additional
factor  in the right-hand side of gamma-2  counts the number of end-points
of the folded string. The anomalous dimension defined in this way is the
coefficient in front of the AdS time in the expression for the action function.
The latter is the solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equations for the system
S-GKP . In the limit of long strings,

string as

 .
Substituting these relations into E-J , one obtains
_J(_s)
=
2 _s N_c   J
 .
This expression defines the anomalous dimension of the twist-two operators
 at strong coupling.




Multi-particle operators: minimal surfaces 


As we have seen in the previous sections, the anomalous dimensions of the twist-two
operators at strong coupling can be obtained using two different approaches
based on the calculation of the Wilson loop with a cusp and the classical
energy of a long string rotating on the AdS background. In this section we will
generalize these results to -particle conformal operators of higher twist.

We have demonstrated in section , that the anomalous dimensions of
such operators at large spins  occupy the band bounds  whose boundaries,
Eqs. gamma-max  and gamma-min , are defined by the cusp anomalous
dimension. Since this result holds for arbitrary coupling constant, one makes use
of cusp-strong  to replace  by its asymptotic
behavior at strong coupling. Remarkably enough, the same result can be obtained
from the gauge/string duality.

Following the approach described in section , one has to
construct the minimal surface on the AdS target space whose boundary
involves multiple cusps. The number of cusps, , varies along the band. On the
upper and lower boundary it equals  and , respectively. At large ,
the expectation value of the product of Wilson loops factorizes into the product
of their expectation values (see Fig. )
W_[_1,_2]W_[_k,_1] =
W_[_1,_2] W_[_k,_1] 
This implies that the area of the minimal surface corresponding to the Wilson
loop with  cusps is given by the sum of  elementary areas derived in
section W_[_j,_j+1 ] 
( S(_j) + S (_j+1 ) )
=
^
 _cusp  (_j;_s)
+
 _cusp  (_j+1 ; _s)
 
=
^
(_j + _j+1 )  _cusp  (_s)
 
 .
Substituting this relation into W-vev , we calculate the total area of the
minimal surface
S (_1, , _k)
=
2 _j=1 ^k S (_j)
=
2  _cusp  (_s)
_j=1 ^k _j  2 k  _cusp  (_s) for . As before, the
coefficient in front of the  at  and  can be identified as
the anomalous dimensions of the -particle conformal operators,
 and , respectively, for .


Multi-particle operators: revolving closed string 


Let us turn to the picture of a rotating closed string. We remind that the
anomalous dimension of the twist-two conformal operators, 
, at strong coupling is related to the energy of the rotating
Nambu-Goto string evaluated on a classical configuration with the minimal energy
for a given angular momentum . In the AdS background such configuration
corresponds to a folded rotating long string. It is worth mentioning that the
emerging picture is a generalization of the well-known hadronic string for the
meson states from flat to curved background, see, e.g.,. Attempting
to extend the Gubser-Klebanov-Polyakov approach to -particle conformal
operators, one immediately encounters the following difficulty. In distinction
with the  case, the anomalous dimensions occupy the band bounds . On the
stringy side, this indicates the existence of additional stringy degrees of
freedom. One expects that their total number should be  in accordance with
the total number of integrals of motion  in the Heisenberg
spin chain (both in classical and quantum cases). The spectrum of the integrals
of motion is specified by the total angular momentum  and the set of integers
.
(These integers appear in the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization conditions
imposed on the orbits of classical motion.) 
Going over to the strong coupling regime, the integrability properties of the
evolution equations may be lost, but the analytical structure of the energy
spectrum remains intact. In other words, for large  the anomalous dimensions
of -particle operators are parameterized by the same set of integers,
 although the
explicit form of this dependence may be different at strong and weak coupling.
As we will argue below, these additional degrees of freedom can be identified
as string junctions .

 Baryon string with a junction. 

Let us consider the simplest case of the  conformal operators. Similar to
the  case, we expect to recover a folded closed string rotating on the AdS
background. Its total angular momentum equals the Lorentz spin of the conformal
operator. Since the logarithmically enhanced contribution, , to the
energy of the string originates from the boundary region rho0 , the large 
asymptotics of the anomalous dimension depends on how many bits of the folded
string approach the boundary (see Fig. ). The fact that the
anomalous dimensions on the upper boundary gamma-max  scale as 
suggests that the corresponding stringy configuration consists of three long
bits, which are interconnected at some point close to the center of the AdS.
Similar Y -shaped configurations are well-known in QCD as describing
baryonic string and following we will refer to the string vertex as
the string junction. There is however a number of important differences.

Since the quarks in QCD belong to the fundamental representation of the 
group for , the color-singlet baryonic operators are built from 
quarks and the baryonic vertex in the corresponding Y -shaped hadronic
string contains the same number of string bits. Within the AdS/CFT framework, at
large , similar baryonic vertices have been constructed in Ref. .
In supersymmetric theories, fermions belong to the adjoint representation of the
, which allows one to construct color-singlet composite operators
containing an arbitrary number  of fermions, see e.g. Eq. O-N . This
leads to important differences in the renormalization properties of such
operators both at the weak and strong coupling. Namely, at large , the
interaction between fermions in the adjoint representation occurs only between
nearest neighbours while in the fundamental representation, due to antisymmetry
of the baryonic vertex under permutation of quarks, the interaction between any
pair of quarks is allowed. In the string representation, one can effectively
replace a Wilson line in the adjoint representation by a pair of Wilson lines in
the fundamental representation running in opposite directions. Then, one can
construct the Y -shaped baryonic vertex as shown in Fig. . In
distinction with the previous case, this vertex contains six string bits, but,
as before, we shall call it the string junction.

The Y -shaped string on the AdS background is described by the
action
S = 2  R^2 2
_k = 1 ^N = 3 
d _1^(k)  d _2^(k) 
 - 
G^MN 
_a  X_M^(k) 
_b  X_N^(k) 
 
 ,
where the superscript  enumerates three different "arms" and
 are local coordinates on the worldsheet of
the -th arm. Making use of the reparameterization invariance and assigning
 and 
 to the folding point and string junction, respectively, one can write the
boundary condition along the string junction as 


. The string equations of motion
corresponding to the action ThreeString  take the following form in the

and  with

invariant under reparametrization . To fix this
ambiguity we identify the local coordinate on the world-sheet as the time
coordinate on the AdS space . Then, the energy and the angular
momentum of the string are given by

X_M^(1)  (,_1())

 .
Solving the system of equations EQs , EQ-junction  and wl-junction ,
one can find the classical motion of the Y -shaped string on the AdS
background and apply E,J  to calculate the corresponding energy and angular
momentum.

In the flat space, for hadronic QCD string, this analysis has been carried out in
Refs. . In that model, the Y -shaped string describes the
spectrum of baryons and the string junction plays the role of their additional
degree of freedoms. It was found that the dependence of the mass of baryons, 
, on their angular momentum  takes the Regge form, 
with  depending on the classical dynamics of the junction and taking the
values within the band . The maximal value 
corresponds to the configuration when the string junction is at rest and three
bits of the string have the form of the rods of the same length, rotating with
the same angular velocity and forming the same angle  against each other
(recall the analogy with the interior minimal surface of three joint soap
bubbles). The minimal value , corresponds to the meson-like Regge
trajectory, i.e.  in Eq. (). In this case, the baryon
has the diquark-quark structure, that is the end-points of two bits are located
close to each other and to the string junction. As we will argue in a moment,
similar picture emerges in the AdS geometry.

To start with, we notice that short strings rotating around the center of the
AdS do not feel its curvature and, therefore, look the same as strings in
a flat background. That is, the dependence of the energy, , and the angular
momentum, , of the string on its angular velocity  is the same in
two cases. The only difference is due to different representation of the fermions
- the open hadronic string in QCD is replaced by a folded closed string in the
supersymmetric case. In the long-string limit, as was first shown in Ref.
, a long folded string rotating on the AdS background gives
rise to the anomalous dimensions of local composite operators of large spin
. According to GKP , the anomalous dimension scales as  with the
prefactor depending on the number of string bits reaching the boundary rho0 .
In particular, meson-like long folded string gives rises rise to the anomalous
dimension of two-particle conformal operators, Eq. ().

Generalizing this picture to the case of baryon-like folded strings, we consider
the same Y -shaped configuration as in the hadronic string with the only
difference that each bit of the "fundamental" string is replaced by two bits
of the folded string. One can verify that such configuration satisfies the
classical equations of motion on the AdS background. Since the string junction
vertex is at rest, the energy of the rotating folded Y -shaped string is
given by the sum of energies of three arms, i.e. we can choose the gauge
 and
. The same is
true for the total angular momentum. Due to symmetry of the configuration, three
arms have the same energy and the angular momentum which in their turn are equal
to half of the energy and the angular momentum of the meson-like folded string
discussed in section  As a consequence, the energy spectrum
of the Y -shaped baryonic string with the string junction at rest and mesonic
string are related to each other as
E_Y   () = 32 E_I  ()
 , J_Y   () = 32 J_I  ()
 .
For , in the limit of short string, 32 
coincides with the known relation between Regge trajectories of mesons and
baryons described by the hadronic QCD string. For , in the limit
of long strings, one calculates the anomalous dimension of the  particle
conformal operators as
_J^N=3 
=
E_Y  () - J_Y   ()
=
32 [ E_I  ()-J_I  () ]
=
32 _J^tw-2 
=
3  _cusp (_s)J
 .
We observe that this expression coincides with the upper bound in the spectrum of
the anomalous dimensions of -particle operators, Eq. bounds .

We would like to stress that gamma-AdS  corresponds to the Y -shaped
string with the string junction at rest. In general, the classical solutions to
the string equations of motion are parameterized by the classical trajectory of
the junction, . For given total angular momentum
 the minimal classically allowed energy of the Y -shaped string depends on
the junction trajectories. It is well-known that on the flat background and junction
moving, the minimal energy of the string with the total angular momentum 
 is smaller than the energy  defined in 32 .
Obviously, the same property holds for short strings on the AdS background. Going
over to the limit of long strings, one expects that the energy levels do not
collide and, as a consequence, the same hierarchy is preserved. In other words,
the minimal energy of the Y -shaped long string with the string junction
moving is smaller than the energy with the junction at rest. This implies that
the anomalous dimensions of the corresponding -particle conformal operators
is smaller than the anomalous dimension  defined in gamma-AdS .
Moreover, the minimal energy of the Y -shaped string for the given total
angular momentum  corresponds to the diquark-quark configuration when the
string junction is located near the folding point. In that case, the energy
and the angular momentum of the string approaches the energy and the angular
momentum of the mesonic string,  and ,
respectively, and, as a consequence, the anomalous dimension of the -particle
conformal operator coincides with the twist-two anomalous dimension,
. These properties are in a perfect
agreement with the expression obtained before within the Wilson line approach
Eq. bounds .

We recall that at  the spectrum of the anomalous dimensions, 
, is parameterized by integer . We have demonstrated
that the two "extreme" classical trajectories of the junction, that is the
junction at rest and rotating along the AdS boundary, are mapped into the upper
and lower boundaries of the band,  and , respectively.
We expect that similar correspondence exists for arbitrary .

Let us now consider the -particle conformal operators. As was shown in section
, the spectrum of their anomalous dimensions at weak
coupling is parameterized by the set of  integers . Going over to
the strong coupling limit, we expect that the same structure should be present.
In other words, the string configuration describing such operators has to manifest
the  additional degrees of freedom. At  such degree of freedom is
provided by the string junction. For  one can use the Y -shaped
folded string as a building block to construct the classical string with an
arbitrary number of bits. An example is shown in Fig. .
Notice that the number of junctions for the string with  folding points
equals .  It worth mentioning that similar configurations in hadronic
QCD string describe exotic mesons and baryons.

 String picture of multi-particle operators. 

A general analysis of such string configurations is rather involved, even on the
flat background. Nevertheless, the asymptotic behavior of the anomalous 
 can be easily derived by considering the
limiting case when all  folding points approach the AdS boundary. As in the
 case, the  junctions are at rest so that the energy and angular
momentum of the string with  arms receives an additive contribution from each
arm. This result agrees with the upper bound in the spectrum of the -particle
conformal operator, Eq. gamma-max .

A natural question arises about the possible physical interpretation of the string
junction. If the string junction is a genuine physical degree of freedom of
-particle operators, it should be also found at weak coupling. As we have
discussed in section , the anomalous dimensions at weak
coupling are identified as the eigenvalues of the one-loop QCD dilatation operator
which coincides at large Lorentz spin  with spin chain Hamiltonian,
Eq. gamma-int . In the quasiclassical approach, the anomalous dimensions are
calculated by imposing the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization conditions on the orbits
of classical motion of  particles on the light-cone. The latter can be
significantly simplified by going over from the original, light-cone
-coordinates to the separated -coordinates. The Hamilton-Jacobi equations
for the action function  take the following form in the separated coordinates
y^2 = t_N (z) - 4 z^2N 
where  and 
with  at large  and  being the higher integrals of motion.
This hyperelliptic curve of genus  is a "surface of equal energy" for
a given set of the integrals of motion  which define the coordinates on
the moduli space of the complex structures of the Riemann surface surface1 .
Quasiclassical calculation of the anomalous dimension at weak coupling, Eq.
gamma-int , amounts to the quantization of the moduli space of these complex
structures.

In particular, at  the Riemann surface surface1  corresponding to the
baryonic operator has the topology of a torus. In that case, the collective
degrees of freedom "live" on this surface. The Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization
conditions allow one to find the quantized values of the integral of motion
 and calculate the corresponding anomalous dimension
. It turns out that the upper and the lower bounds in their
spectrum,  and , correspond to
 and , respectively. At these values of  the Riemann
surface surface1  becomes degenerate, that is one of the cycles shrinks into a
point. From the point of view of classical mechanics this corresponds to freezing
out the collective degrees of freedom. We observe that the same phenomenon occurs
at the strong coupling. Namely, the string junction is at rest at the upper bound
of the spectrum and at the di-quark center-of-mass at the lower bound of the
spectrum. This suggests that the classical dynamics of the string junction is
governed by yet another Riemann surface of the same genus. Indeed, it is known
that the general solutions to the string equations of motion EQs  are
parametrized by a hyperelliptic curve of higher genus. The explicit
form of this curve is fixed by the boundary conditions. In the case of the string
with  junctions such conditions are given by Eqs. EQ-junction . It
would be interesting to compare surface1  with the curve emerging at strong
coupling.


Concluding remarks 


The present paper was devoted to studies of the anomalous dimensions of
conformal operators at weak and strong coupling. We have demonstrated that
in the both regimes the anomalous dimensions behave asymptotically as
 at large Lorentz spin 
while the dependence of the cusp anomalous dimension on the coupling constant
is different. At weak coupling, we calculated the first two terms of
perturbative expansion of  in a generic
gauge theory involving scalars. While at large coupling we obtained its
leading asymptotic behavior using classical limit of string propagating on
the AdS background.

In perturbative regime, we have found the one-loop cusp anomaly corresponds to
angular gluon propagation on a cylinder. This allows to establish a relation of
the former to the quantum transition amplitude of a spherical top. Due to
localization phenomena, it is  saturated by classical trajectories, i.e.
multiple windings of paths around the principle circles of a sphere. All of these
properties are naturally incorporated into the two-dimensional gauge theory on a
disk. There, the cusp anomaly is expressed as an integral of the partition
function with a boundary holonomy with respect to the area of the disk. The
well-known relation of Yang-Mills in two dimensions to a string theory, give us
the opportunity to give a stringy representation of the cusp anomalous dimension
at weak coupling.

At strong coupling, we extended the Gubser-Klebanov-Polyakov results for
twist-two operators as a rapidly rotating closed string to multi-particle
cases. The integrability of one-loop interaction kernel implies that the
-particle anomalous dimension is a function of  parameters, -
conserved charges. One expects that strong coupling will share similar
property, - the anomalous dimension will keep this properties. In the
stringy picture, these new degrees of freedom are encoded into the string
junctions. The equation of motion for the latter are parametrized by a
hyperelliptic curve, i.e. their classical dynamics of the string is
driven by a Riemann surface. This will be discussed elsewhere.

To establish the relation between the two expressions for 
 using the gauge/string correspondence, one has to provide the explicit
mapping between the conformal operators in Yang-Mills theory and eigenstates of
the stringy Hamiltonian on some background. Then, one can identify the anomalous
dimensions of the conformal operators for arbitrary  as the energy of
the corresponding stringy excitations. To go over from the strong coupling regime
to arbitrary coupling constant in gauge theory, one needs to know the whole
spectrum of the quantum string. At present this problem can not be solved in
full due to lack of the quantization of the strings on AdSS
background.

It is known that this difficulty can be avoided by considering the Penrose
limit of the AdSS background. It is relevant to calculation
of the anomalous dimension of local operators in the  YM theory
with large -charge. The string theory on this background
is exactly solvable and, as a consequence, the spectrum of the stringy
excitations can be found. In this case, the gauge/string correspondence looks
as follows. There are six adjoint scalars  in 
theory and the -symmetry rotates two of them, say  and
. The stringy oscillator states are mapped into the so-called
BNM operators constructed from the complex field 
. Namely, the operator  with the large
-charge  is dual to the ground state of the string of the length
, , while the operator with two "impurities" is dual to excited
oscillatory stringy state
a_n^i   a_-n ^j  
0,J  _l = 0 ^J ^2 i l n/J 
 [  _i  Z^l   _j  Z^J - l  ]
 ,
where . The exact spectrum of the string Hamiltonian in
the pp-wave background gives rise to the anomalous dimensions of the BMN
operators with large -charge for arbitrary coupling constant. At strong
coupling they coincide with expressions obtained in the quasiclassical
approximation while at weak coupling they match the first few terms of
perturbative expansion.

It turned out that the quantum string on the pp-background is intrinsically
related to integrable spin chains. The latter appear when one examines the
renormalization of the local operators 
 at weak coupling in the multi-color limit. These
operators mix under renormalization already at one-loop level and their
eigenvalues can be found by diagonalizing the corresponding mixing matrix
. As was found in, the one-loop mixing matrix
coincides with the Hamiltonian of a completely integrable  Heisenberg
spin chain defined in an appropriate basis. The length of the spin chain is
equal to  and the spin operators belong to the fundamental representation
of the  group. The appearance of this group can be traced back to the
fact that the same group is the isometry group of the S.

We observe a striking similarity between renormalization properties of such
operators and conformal operators discussed above. In both cases, the one-loop
mixing matrix gives rise to an integrable spin chain. The dynamical symmetry
group of the spin chain, - the  group for the local scalar operators
and the  group for the conformal operators, - is dictated
by the isometry of the relevant part of the background, the  and the AdS
parts, respectively. In spite of the fact that two spin chains are different
their energy spectrum can be obtained within the Bethe Ansatz in a similar
manner by quantizing their spectral curves. For the  magnet
the spectral curve, Eq. surface1 , is hyperelliptic and its genus equals
the number of fields involved. For the  magnet the curve is more complicated
and it can be reduced to hyperelliptic curve of the genus  if one considers
only its  subgroup. Having these properties in mind, one may consider a
more general case of renormalization of a local composite operator built from
an arbitrary number of scalar fields and covariant derivatives acting along
different light-cone directions,  with
 and . One might expect that the corresponding
one-loop mixing matrix is related to the spin chain with the symmetry group
, which is the isometry group of the AdSS
background.

Going over to the strong coupling regime, one should ask about the fate of
integrability of the mixing matrix. For the scalar, BMN like operators it has
been suggested that integrability holds to higher loop orders.
Would it be the case, the transition of the anomalous dimensions from weak to
strong coupling regime would correspond to the flow in the space of integrable
Hamiltonians with respect to the coupling constant . Moreover, had
the same property be valid for conformal operators, it would allow one to
calculate their anomalous dimensions at large spin  for arbitrary .
This question certainly deserves further studies.

We would like to stress that the origin of integrability of the one-loop mixing
matrix remains obscure. A possible explanation could come from the stringy
picture for the cusp anomalous dimension as weak coupling discussed in section
. We have argued that the corresponding string picture emerges
from the two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory which in its turn is equivalent to
topological theory at  with the gauge group . The
latter theory is the limit of the  Chern-Simons theory at
the level . It is known that the correlation functions of the
Wilson lines in the Chern-Simons theory exhibit integrable structure related
to the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain with symmetry group  and
anisotropy . In this way, for  one
recovers the homogeneous XXX spin chain. The use of Chern-Simons approach
for the calculation of the anomalous dimensions of the operators with arbitrary
conformal spins and the corresponding stringy picture behind will be discussed
elsewhere.

Cusp anomaly in dimensional reduction 


The difference between two-loop expressions for the cusp anomalous dimension
in the dimensional regularization and dimensional reduction schemes,
Eqs. two-loop  and two-loop-DR , respectively, is solely due to
difference of the corresponding one-loop gluon polarization operators. In
gauge theory it receives contribution from gauge bosons,  fundamental
fermions and  scalars. In the momentum representation in two different
schemes one obtains (with the Feynman gauge)

 dimensional regularization (DREG):
 

 dimensional reduction (DRED):
 
where  and  are metric tensors in the
Minkowski space-time of dimension  and  with
, respectively, and  is a bare coupling constant.
Note that in supersymmetric theories the -dimensional Lorentz non-covariant
part vanishes in the right-hand side of PolarizationDRED 
 
which is easy to very at  (, ), 
(, ) and  (, ).

The regularized polarization operators in the DREG and DRED schemes have the
same residue at the pole in  and differ by a finite 
-term due to contribution of -scalars in the DRED
scheme. To renormalize the obtain expressions, we apply the modified minimal
subtraction procedure. In this way, subtracting the ultraviolet pole from
, one defines the so-called 
 renomalization scheme for the coupling constant. The
counter-term in the  scheme is given by
 
One can define yet another renormalization scheme by adding a finite term to
the right-hand side of ct 
 
In this scheme, the renormalized polarization operator 

coincides with the polarization operator PolarizationDREG  renormalized
within the conventional dimensional regularization  scheme,
that is

refers to MS-scheme  as the dimensional reduction 
scheme. The coupling constants in two schemes are related to each other through
