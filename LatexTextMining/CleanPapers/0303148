Abstract. 
Though a Chern-Simons -form is not gauge-invariant and it
depends on a background connection, this form seen as a 
Lagrangian of gauge theory on 
a -dimensional manifold leads to the energy-momentum conservation 
law. 
 
The local Chern-Simons (henceforth CS) form seen as a Lagrangian of
the gauge theory on a 3-dimensional manifold is well known to lead
to the local conservation law of the canonical energy-momentum tensor.
Generalizing this result, we show that a global higher-dimensional 
CS gauge theory admits
an energy-momentum conservation law in spite of the fact that its
Lagrangian depends on a background gauge potential and that one can not
ignore its gauge non-invariance. The CS
gravitation theory here is not considered (e.g.,).

We derive Lagrangian energy-momentum
conservation laws from the first variational formula (e.g.,
). Let us consider a first order
field theory on a fibre bundle  over an -dimensional base .
Its Lagrangian is defined as a density  on the first order
jet manifold  of sections of . 
Given bundle coordinates  on a fibre bundle 
, its first and second order jet manifolds  and 
 are equipped with the
adapted coordinates  and 
, respectively. 
We will use the notation  and
.

Given a Lagrangian 

on , the corresponding Euler-Lagrange operator reads
305 L= _i^id_^_i)^i,
 
where  are contact forms and 
 are the total 
derivatives, which yield the total differential 
r73 d_Hd_acting on the pull-back of exterior forms on  onto .
The kernel
Ker of the Euler-Lagrange operator ()
defines the Euler-Lagrange 
equations
. A Lagrangian  is said to be variationally trivial if 
. This property holds iff
, 
where
 is a closed -form on  and  is the horizontal projection 
r71 h_0(dx^)=dx^, h_0(dy^i)=y^i_dx^, h_0(dy^i_)=
y_ ^idx^. The relation  holds.

Any projectable vector field 
e1 u=u^(x^)_+u^i(x^,y^j)_i on  is the infinitesimal
generator of a local one-parameter group of bundle automorphisms of
, and vice versa . Its prolongation onto  is
1.21 J^1u=u^_+ u^i_i +(d_u^i-y^i__u^)^_i.
 
Then, the Lie derivative of a Lagrangian  along  reads
r8 _J^1u L=J^1udL +d(J^1uL)=[_(u^) +
u^i_i+(d_u^i-y^i__u^)^_i]. The first variational
formula provides its canonical decomposition
bC30' && _J^1u L= 
 u_VL + d_Hh_0(uH_L)  =

&& (u^i-y^i_u^)_i- 
d_[(u^y^i_-u^i)^_i-u^], where , 
is the Poincare-Cartan form, and 
Q30 _u =-h_0(uH_L)=_u^_=[(u^y^i_-u^]_
is the symmetry current along . On Ker, 
the first variational formula () leads to the weak 
equality
J4 && _J^1u L

&& _(u^)+
u^i_i+(d_u^i -y^i__u^)^_i
- d_[(u^y^i_-u^i)^_i-u^]. Let the Lie derivative () reduces to
the total differential 
r4 _J^ru L=d_H, e.g., if  is a variationally trivial Lagrangian or
 is invariant under a
one-parameter group
of bundle automorphisms of  generated by .
Then, the weak equality () takes the form 
r5 0-d_H(_u+), regarded as a conservation law of the modified symmetry current
. 

It is readily observed that symmetry currents () obey the relation
e4 _u+u' =_u +_u' . Note that any projectable vector field 
(), projected onto 
a vector field  on , can be written as the sum
e3 u=+(u-) of some lift 
of  onto  and the vertical vector field 
 on . 
The symmetry current  () along a vertical
vector field  is the Noether current
.
The current  () along a lift  onto 
of a vector field  on  is the
energy-momentum current. 
Then the decompositions () and () 
show that any current
 () along a projectable vector field  on a fibre
bundle  can be represented by a sum of an energy-momentum
current and a Noether one. 
Of course, different lifts  and  onto  of a vector field
 on  lead to different energy-momentum currents 
and , whose difference 
is the Noether current along the vertical vector field
 on . 

Note that there exists the category of so called natural fibre bundles
 (e.g., tensor bundles) which admit the canonical lift  
of vector fields  on . Such a lift is the infinitesimal generator of a
one-parameter group of general covariant transformations of . This
is the case of gravitation theory which we here do not concern.

Let us turn to gauge theory of principal connections on a
principal bundle  with a structure  
Lie group . Let  be the first order jet manifold of 
and 
r43 C=J^1P/GX the quotient of  with respect to the canonical action of  on
 (e.g.,).  
There is one-to-one correspondence between the principal connections on
 and the sections of the fibre bundle 
(), called the 
connection bundle. Given an atlas  of , the connection bundle
 is provided with bundle 
coordinates  such that, for any its section , the
local functions  are coefficients of the
familiar local connection form. From the physical viewpoint, 
is a gauge potential.

The infinitesimal 
generators of local one-parameter groups of 
automorphism of a principal bundle 
are -invariant projectable vector fields on . There
is one-to-one correspondence between these vector fields and the sections of
the quotient 
r44 T_GP=TP/GX of the tangent bundle  of  with respect to the
canonical action of  on .
Given a basis  for the
right Lie algebra  of the group , let  
be the corresponding
fibre bases for the vector bundle . Then, a section 
of  reads
e10 =^_+ ^r e_r. The infinitesimal generator
of a one-parameter group  of vertical automorphisms is a
-invariant vertical vector field on  identified
to a section  of the quotient 
V_GP=VP/GT_GP 
of the vertical tangent
bundle  of  by the canonical action of  on .
The Lie bracket of two sections
 and  
of the vector bundle  reads
  [,]=(^_^- ^_^)_  +(^_^r - ^_^r +
c_pq ^r^p^q) e_r, 
where  are the structure constants of the 
Lie algebra . Putting  and , we
obtain the Lie bracket 
1129' [,]= c_pq ^r^p^q e_r of sections of the vector bundle .
A glance at the expression () shows
that the typical fibre of  is the 
Lie algebra . The structure group  acts on  by the 
adjoint representation. 

Note that the connection bundle  () is an affine bundle
modelled over the vector bundle , and elements of  are
represented by local -valued 1-forms 
. 
Bundle automorphisms of a principal bundle  generated by the
vector field 
() induce bundle automorphisms of the connection bundle  whose 
generator is 
e11 _C=^_+ (_^r +
c^r_pq a^p_^q-a^r__^)^_r. The connection bundle  admits the canonical -valued 2-form
r60 dx^+12 c^r_pq a^p_a^q_dx^dx^)e_r, which is the curvature of the canonical connection on the principal
bundle  (e.g.,). 
Given a section  of , the pull-back  
r47' F_A=A^*F^r_ dx^dx^e_r,
F^r_ =_A^r_A^r_+c^r_pq A^p_A^q_,
of  onto  is the strength form of a gauge potential .  

Let  be a -invariant
polynomial of degree  on the Lie algebra  written with
respect to its basis , i.e.,
I_k()=_j b_r_1r_k ^r_1 c^r_j _pq e^p^r_k =
kb_r_1r_k c^r_1 _pq ^p^r_2 ^r_k =0.
Let us associate to  the -form 
r61 P_2k ()=b_r_1r_k ^r_1 ^r_k  on . It is a closed form which is invariant under vertical
automorphisms of .
Let  be a section of . Then, the pull-back 
r63 P_2k (F_A)=A^*P_2k () of  is a closed characteristic form on . Recall that
the de Rham cohomology of  equals that of  since 
is an affine bundle. It follows that  and  possess
the same  
cohomology class 
r62 [P_2k ()]=[P_2k (F_A)] for any principal connection . Thus, 
 
is the familiar Weil homomorphism.

Let  be a fixed section of the connection bundle .
Given the characteristic form  () on , let the same
symbol stand for its pull-back onto . By virtue of the equality 
(), the difference  is an exact form on .
Moreover, similarly to the well-known transgression formula on a
principal bundle , one can obtain the following transgression formula
on :
r64,5 && P_2k ()-P_2k (F_B)=d_2k-1 (B), 

&&  _2k-1 (B)=k^1_0 _2k (t,B)dt, 

&& _2k (t,B)=b_r_1r_k (a^r_1 __1 -B^r_1 __1 )dx^_1 ^r_2 (t,B)^r_k (t,B),

&& ^r_j (t,B)=
[d(ta^r_j __j  +(1-t)B^r_j __j )dx^_j  +

&& 12c^r_j _pq 
(ta^p__j  +(1-t)B^p__j )(ta^q__j  +(1-t)B^q__j )dx^_j 
dx^_j ]e_r.
Its pull-back by means of a section  of  gives
the transgression formula
P_2k (F_A)-P_2k (F_B)=d S_2k-1 (A,B)
on . For instance, if  is the characteristic Chern -form,
then  is the familiar CS -form. 
Therefore, we agree to call 
() the CS form on the connection bundle . 
In particular, one can choose the local section . 
Then,  is
the local CS form. Let  denote its pull-back 
onto  by means of a section  of . Then, the CS form
 admits the decomposition
r75 _2k-1 (B)=_2k-1  -S_2k-1 (B) +dK_2k-1 (B). Let  be the first order jet manifold of the
connection bundle  equipped with the adapted coordinates
. 
Let us consider the pull-back of the CS form () onto 
denoted by the same symbol , and let 
r74 _2k-1 (B)=h_0 _2k-1 (B) be its horizontal projection.
This is given by the formula
&& _2k-1 (B)=k^1_0 _2k (t,B)dt, 

&& _2k (t,B)=b_r_1r_k (a^r_1 __1 -B^r_1 __1 )dx^_1 ^r_2 (t,B)^r_k (t,B),

&& ^r_j (t,B)= 12[
ta^r_j __j_j  +(1-t)__j B^r_j __j 
- ta^r_j __j_j  -(1-t)__j B^r_j __j +

&& 12c^r_j _pq 
(ta^p__j  +(1-t)B^p__j )(ta^q__j  +(1-t)B^q__j ]dx^_j 
dx^_j e_r.
The decomposition () 
induces the decomposition 
r100 _2k-1 (B)=_2k-1  -S_2k-1 (B) +d_H_2k-1 (B), 
_2k-1 (B)=h_0 K_2k-1 (B). Now, let us consider the CS gauge model on a -dimensional base
manifold  whose Lagrangian 
r80 L_CS =_2k-1 (B) is the CS form () on . Let 
r47 _C=(_^r +
c^r_pq a^p_^q)^_r be a vertical vector field on . We have shown that 
r102 _J^1_C  _2k-1 (B)=d_H . 
As a consequence, the CS gauge model with the Lagrangian () admits
the Noether conservation law 
0-d_H(_+),
where
_ _2k-1 (B) (_^r +
c^r_pq a^p_^q)
is the symmetry current along the vertical vector field  ().

Using this fact, let us study energy-momentum conservation laws in the CS
gauge model with the Lagrangian (). Let  be some section
of the connection bundle . 
Given a vector field  on , there
exists its lift
e25 _B' =^_+[_(^B'^r_)+c^r_pq 
a^p_(^B'^q_) - a^r__^]^_r. onto the connection bundle  
. 
Comparing the expressions () and (), one easily
observes that the lift  is the infinitesimal generator of 
bundle automorphisms of  with parameters ,
.
Let us bring locally the vector field () into the sum
mos54 _B'  =_1+_2= [^_
- a^r__^^_r] + 
[_(^B'^r_)+c^r_pq 
a^p_(^B'^q_)]^_r. One can think of  as being the local infinitesimal generator of
general covariant transformations of , while  is a local
vertical vector field on  (cf. ()). Then, the weak
equality () for the Lie derivative
 reads
r103 _J^1_1 _2k-1 (B) + _J^1_2 _2k-1 (B)-d_H_ , where  is the energy-momentum current along .
The second term in the left-hand side of this equality takes the form
(), and the first one does so as follows. Using the
decomposition (), one can write
_J^1_1 _2k-1 (B)=_J^1_1 _2k-1 
+_J^1_1 (S_2k-1 (B)+ d_H_2k-1 (B)).

The first term in the right-hand side of this relation vanishes because
the local CS form  is invariant under general covariant
transformations. The second one takes the form () because 
 is a variationally trivial Lagrangian.
Consequently, the weak equality () comes to the conservation law
0-d_H(_  +of the modified energy-momentum current.

For instance, let  be a semi-simple group and  
the Killing form on . Let 
r48 P()=h 2 a^G_mn ^m^n be the second Chern form up to a constant multiple. Given a section  of
, the transgression formula
() on  reads
r49 P()-P(F_B)=d_3(B), 
where  is the CS 3-form up to a constant multiple. 
Let us a consider the gauge model on a 3-dimensional base manifold
whose Lagrangian is 
r50 &&L_CS =h_0(_3(B))= _3 -S_3(B) +d_H_3(B)=
[12 ha^G_mn  ^ a^m_(^n_  -13
c^n_pq a^p_a^q_)  

&& -12 ha^G_mn  ^ B^m_(F(B)^n_  -13
c^n_pq B^p_B^q_)
-d_(ha^G_mn  ^ a^m_B^n_)]d^3x, 

&& ^r_ dx^dx^e_r, ^r_ =a^r_ -a^r_  +c^r_pq a^p_a^q_.
Since  is a variationally trivial local
Lagrangian, the first variational formula for the CS Lagrangian ()
reduces to that for the local CS Lagrangian 
r105 _3=12 ha^G_mn  ^ a^m_(^n_  -13
c^n_pq a^p_a^q_)d^3x. On-shell, it reads
r86 _J^1_2 _3- d_H_ , where  is the symmetry current () of 
() along the vector field  ().
A simple calculation gives 
&& _J^1_2 _3
=-d_[ha^G_mn ^ _(^B'^m_) a^n_]d^3x,

&& _ ^mn ^ [a^m_d_(^a^n_)
+_(^nu B'^m_+c^m_pq a^p_^B'^q_)a^n_]-^_3. 
Thus, we come to the conservation law 
of the modified energy-momentum current
 ^-
ha^G_mn ^ _(^B'^m_) a^n_.
