Abstract   
  
  
We calculate the coefficients of three-point functions 
of vector BMN operators. We find that these coefficients 
coincide with those of the three-point functions of 
scalar BMN operators. 
This is in agreement with the  symmetry 
of the pp-wave string theory.
Our results confirm the vertex-correlator pp-wave duality
for BMN operators with vector impurities.


  
  
  
  

  
  


Introduction   



The pp-wave/SYM correspondence of Berenstein, Maldacena and Nastase (BMN)
represents all massive modes of type IIB superstring theory 
in a  plane wave background
in terms of composite BMN operators in  
 Super Yang-Mills in  four dimensions. 
Until now, most of the calculations on the gauge theory
side of the correspondence were restricted to the BMN operators 
with scalar impurities. 

The goal of the present paper is to extend the study
of correlation functions of scalar BMN operators
 
to correlators of vector BMN operators. 
In particular we will address the relevance of a  symmetry of the
pp-wave string theory for  the three-point functions of 
vector BMN operators in the gauge theory.
Two-point correlators of BMN operators with vector impurities
have already been considered in.
We will compute three-point functions of BMN operators
with two vector impurities and with one vector plus one scalar impurity.
These three-point functions are essential for the vertex-correlator 
pp-wave duality.
We will find that our results for the coefficients
of the three-point functions of vector BMN operators 
are in precise agreement with the  prediction of the 
vertex-correlator duality formula obtained in.
This duality formula has already been confirmed at the level
of BMN operators with two and three scalar impurities in
. Here we will verify this formula for BMN operators
with two vector and one vector plus one scalar impurity.


On the string theory side,
the pp-wave background has a bosonic
symmetry of , where the 
 exchanges the action of the two  groups. 
This symmetry acts quite trivially at the free string level
. However, its realisation in the dual 
field theory is not manifest and, therefore, highly non-trivial. 
In the pp-wave/SYM duality, the rotation groups  
 in the lightcone-gauge string
theory  are mapped to the product of
the  Lorentz (Euclidean) symmetry and the R-symmetry,
, in  the field theory. 
Thus, on the field theory side, the 
 factor swaps the action of 
 with .
 A symmetry between 

spacetime and the internal (R-)space
is novel, and might possibly be expected only in the 
large- double scaling limit. 
The understanding of the  symmetry, both in the
interacting string theory 
and in field theory, is one of
the most challenging and exciting topics in the pp-wave/SYM duality.

In field theory, the BMN operators that are dual to string excitations
in the first four directions, i.e. related to the factor ,
carry impurities of the form  (vector impurities).


Two-point functions and anomalous dimensions of conformal primary 
vector BMN operators have been considered and determined 
in. 
The minimal form of the BMN correspondence is based on the 
mass-dimension type duality relation which
maps the masses of string states to the anomalous dimensions of the
corresponding BMN operators in the gauge theory:

H _string  = H _SYM  - J  .

This relation has been verified for scalar BMN operators
in the planar limit of SYM perturbation theory
in.
Calculations in the BMN sector of gauge theory at the
nonplanar level were performed in
 also taking into account
mixing effects of planar BMN operators.
The relation was extended
into all orders in the effective genus expansion parameter .
Inanomalous dimensions of vector BMN operators
were found to be equal to those of scalar BMN operators.
This verifies the
consistency of the  symmetry with the
relation hh . 


However, no further statement has been made so far about the
 symmetry beyond the mass-dimension duality
hh . 
We will show that three-point functions 
also respect the  symmetry in the BMN limit. 
This is in complete agreement with
the manifestly -invariant
vertex-correlator duality formula of.
To achieve this goal, we will first need to carry out a field
theory analysis of the three-point function involving BMN operators
with vector impurities. This part of the analysis is new and 
contains some of the main results of this paper.

Let us recall that in a conformal theory, 
two- and three-point functions of conformal primary
operators are completely determined by conformal invariance. 
One can always choose a basis of scalar  conformal primary operators 
such that the two-point functions take the canonical form:

 
and all the nontrivial information of the
three-point function is contained in the -independent
coefficient :
 
where .

Since the form of the -dependence of 
conformal three-point functions is universal,
it is natural to expect that the spacetime independent coefficient 
is related to the interaction of the corresponding three string states
in  the pp-wave background.
Note that, in order to be able to use the coefficients ,
it is essential to work on the SYM side with -BMN operators.

These operators are defined in such a way that they do not mix
with each other (i.e. have definite scaling
dimensions ) and are conformal primary operators.
Conformal invariance
of the  theory then implies that the two-point correlators
of scalar -BMN
operators are canonically normalized,
and the three-point functions take the simple form 3pt .
Defined in this way, the basis of -BMN operators is 
unique and distinct from other BMN bases considered in the literature. 
For two scalar impurities,
this -BMN basis was constructed in.

However, due to their nontrivial transformation properties under 
the conformal group, 
conformal primary vector  BMN operators 
have in general  more complicated 
two- and three-point functions. 
Thus, a priori, it is not clear whether it is possible (and how) 
to extract in the vector case
a spacetime independent coefficient, similar to the
 of the scalar correlators,  that can then be compared
with the pp-wave string interaction.  In our opinion, this is one of the
main obstacles in the understanding of how
the pp-wave/SYM duality works for vector impurities and of
the ro le of the  symmetry
beyond the level of the two-point functions in the pp-wave/SYM
correspondence. 
In this paper, we make the important observation  
that  in a certain large distance limit, the
two- and three-point correlation
functions for vector BMN operators reduce to the same form as that for 
the scalar case. 

This allows one to
make a direct comparison with  the corresponding
scalar three-point functions and check the  symmetry.

The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2,
we present the BMN operators with vector impurities and with positive
R-charge. To obtain non-vanishing correlators, one also needs 
to know the conjugate BMN operators, i.e. the BMN
operators with negative R-charge. We construct these operators by employing
a  new conjugation operation which is a product of the usual
hermitian conjugation with the inversion operation. We explain why
this construction is the
most natural one in

the present context. 
An important advantage of our construction is that the
vector BMN operators are orthonormal with respect to the inner
product defined using this conjugation. 
In Section 3.1, we compute the three-point functions for two 
vector-BMN operators, each with two vector impurities, 
and a vacuum operator, in the free field theory
in the leading order in .  We find that the three-point
functions, in the limit where the negatively charged BMN operator is
located far away, take precisely the same from as the three-point
function with scalar-BMN operators. Moreover, the precise numerical 
coefficient also agrees with the scalar case.
In Section 3.2, we extend the analysis to the first order in the 
effective coupling . 
Again, a precise agreement with the corresponding three-point
function with scalar BMN operators is found. 
In Section 3.3, we extend this analysis to the case  of 
BMN operators with one vector and one scalar impurity
and draw our conclusions.

Note on notation and conventions 


We write the bosonic part of the 
 Lagrangian as
L   = 2g^2   ( 1 4  F_ F_  + 
12 (D__i) (D__i ) 
-14  [_i ,_j][_i ,_j]) 
 , 

where ,  are the six real scalar fields
transforming under an R-symmetry group . 
The  covariant derivative is 
 , 
where 
, and 
.
If we define the complex combinations
^1 = = _1 + i _2 2    , 
^2 = = _3 + i _4 2    , 
^3 = Z  = _5 + i _6 2    , 
the  Lagrangian can be re-expressed as 
L   = 2g^2   ( 1 4  F_ F_  + 
(D__I )  (D_^I )) 
+ V_F + V_D  , 

where
V_F & = & - 2g^2   ( 
[ ^I , ^J ] [_I ,  _J ] ) 
 =  -2  2g^2   ( Z Z    - 
 Z  Z + )  , 

 V_D & = &  12  2g^2   ( [ ^I , _I ] 
 [ ^J , _J ] )  = 
2g^2   ( Z Z Z Z  - ZZ Z Z 
+ )  
are the F-term and D-term of the scalar potential respectively. 
In the last equalities we write only the terms which will be 
relevant for our analysis.

Our  generators are normalised as
( T^a T^b ) = ^ab   , 
so that, for example,  

< Z^i _j (x) Z ^l _m (0) > = 
g^22  ^i _m  ^l _j (x) 
  ,   (x)= 14^2 x^2     .
The pp-wave/SYM duality is supposed to hold in the BMN large 
double scaling limit,
J N   , N .
In this limit there remain two free finite dimensionless
parameters:
the effective coupling constant of the BMN sector of gauge theory,
 = g^2 N J^2  = 1 (p^+ and the effective genus counting parameter
 
of Feynman diagrams.
The right hand sides of lampr , gtwo  express  and

of the pp-wave string theory parameters.




  
Conformal  primary vector BMN operators  
Here we will study the BMN operators with 
vector impurites(CSC and VVK acknowledge an early collaboration with
Michela Petrini, Rodolfo Russo and Alessandro Tanzini on the radial
quantisation method and its applications to vector BMN operators 
discussed in section 2 of this paper.
) .
We will be concerned with  the operators 
_vac ^J = 1J N_0 ^J   
Z^J  , 
and, 

for  , 

_, n ^J =

( _l=0 ^J e^2i nl J  [ 
( D_ Z) Z^l ( D_ Z)Z^J-l  ]+ 
[( D_ D_  Z) Z^J+1 ])  +   ,
where we defined 



:= 12 J N_0^J+2   
 , N_0 := g^2 2 N 4^2   .

The normalisation of the operator  is such that 
its two-point function takes the canonical form 2pt 
in the planar limit. 
As for the vector BMN operator , it is normalized in
such a way that Eq. stringoverl  below holds.
We note that
this choice of normalisation constant  
is different from that(In particular we have the
same normalisation constant for both cases  and . 
This 
is related to our prescription for the operator conjugation and 
the definition of the inner product. 
We will explain how this prescription is dictated 
by the pp-wave/SYM correspondence.) 
adopted in. 

The first operator, , 
is a chiral (half-BPS) primary operator, 
and corresponds to the vacuum state of pp-wave string theory. 
For ,
the second operator,  is a 
non-chiral vector conformal primary BMN operator, and corresponds 
to a string state .
Here  and  are indices of bosonic excitations of the 

first  in the lightcone pp-wave string theory.
(We adopt the convention that 
BMN operators with vector (resp. scalar) impurities correspond to 
bosonic excitations  of the first (resp. second)
 in the lightcone pp-wave string theory.)  
 The operator  has a definite scaling dimension,
, 
which implies that the single-trace expression on the right hand side of
opndef  must be accompanied with multi-trace corrections 
(and other mixing effects) at higher orders in 
.
The dots on the right hand side  of opndef  
indicate these corrections. These mixing terms are important in general,
but in this paper we will show how to calculate correlation functions
involving operators opndef 
without the need of knowing the precise analytical expressions for 
these mixing terms.
(We will therefore omit the dots from now on.) 
For , the operator 
is a supergravity translational descendant of the vacuum: 
_, 0 ^J&=& 

( _l=0 ^J  [ 
( D_ Z) Z^l ( D_ Z)Z^J-l  ] + 
[( D_ D_  Z) Z^J+1 ] )

 
&=&
_ _  Z^J+2 2J^3/ 2   
N_0 ^J+2    .
This operator is protected, hence its conformal dimension is given by  
the engineering dimension.



We now note that the operators 
 are not orthogonal with respect to the scalar product 
, 
and therefore cannot 

correspond to the (orthonormal) basis 
of string states 

(at least not directly). 
For example,
one hasfor the translational descendant defined in sugradesc , 
_, 0 ^J   (x)_, 0 ^J (0)=
4 J^2(x^2)^J+4  x_x_x_x_x^4 
 ,
which
is non-zero for .

We also note that,  in order to keep the right hand side of 
() finite as , an additional factor of  
 would be required in the
definition sugradesc 
of  . 


The right hand side of sugranorm1  has nothing to do
with an orthonormality of the string states.
We therefore introduce a different  notion of conjugation, 
which will allow a direct  correspondence to string 
(and supergravity) states  defined as  hermitian conjugation  
followed by an inversion :

(i) We define the barred-operator  as

 _, n ^J (x) & :=&

 
x^2(- 2)   (
_l=0 ^J   e^2i nl J 
[
(J_  D _   x^2Z  ) Z ^l 
( J_ D _  x^2Z  )Z ^J-l  
] 

 
&+&
 
[(  J_  D _ )
(x^2 J_  D _ ) x^2 Z ] 
Z ^J+1  )
 ,
where  
is the usual inversion tensor, in terms of which the Jacobian 
of the inversion   is expressed
.
 
(ii)  We introduce the inner product
_x   _1 (x) _2(0)and, 

(iii)  propose 
the correspondence between field theory and string theory inner products:
_x   _1 (x) _2(0) 
_1_2 ,
where  is the string state that is in correspondence with the field theory
operator . 






We remark that

the introduction of the barred-operator 
is completely  natural in the context  
of the radial quantisation  of field theory, 
where hermitian conjugation is always accompanied 
by an inversion. Indeed, under inversion  
a scalar field 
of conformal dimension  transforms as_  (x) _ ^'  (x') = 
x^2    _ (x)   , 
  x_ x'_  = x_  x^2 
 .
Differentiating both sides of scalinv 
with respect to  we obtain
_ ^'  _ ^'  (x') = 
x^2 J_  (x) _   [x^2   _  (x)]
 .
Combining the action of hermitian conjugation with an inversion, 
we get

_  _  (x) = 
x^2 J_  (x) _   [x^2   _ ^  (x)]
 , 
from which it follows(

A note on conventions: a bar applied to a composite operator 
will always mean  hermitian conjugation times an inversion as in
newbarq . For ordinary fields we continue to use 
.) 
 that 


 _, n ^J (x)& =&

(
_l=0 ^J   e^2i nl J 
[
(x^2J_  D _   x^2Z  ) (x^2Z )^l 
(x^2J_ D _  x^2Z  )(x^2Z )^J-l  
] 

 
&+&
 
[( x^2 J_  D _ )
(x^2 J_  D _ ) x^2 Z ] 
(x^2 Z )^J+1  )
 ,
which is the free-theory expression for newbarq .



We note that the expression for the string operator
opndef  can be more compactly  written as 

_, n ^J =
J 
_i,j=1 ^J+2  
e^2i n(j-i) J  
D_ ^x_i D_ ^x_j 
.
[  Z (x_1)Z (x_J+2 ) ]
_x_1= x_J+2  = x 
 .

The corresponding expression for the free barred-operator is given then
by 

 _, n ^J =
J 
_i,j=1 ^J+2  
e^2i n(i-j) J  
(x^2 J_ D_ )^x_i 
(x^2 J_ D_ )^x_j 

.
[  x_1^2 Z (x_1)x^2_J+2  
Z (x_J+2 ) ]
_x_1= x_J+2  = x 

We now apply newbarq , or, equivalently
newbar , to 
the protected supergravity operator 
in sugradesc 
 _, 0 ^J= 
(x^2 J_  _ )
(x^2 J_ _ )  (x^2 Z )^J+2 
2 J^3/ 2  N_0 ^J+2   
 , 
and sugranorm1  is now replaced by

the inner product  
 _, 0 ^J (x)_, 0 ^J (0) &=& 
(x^2 J_   _ ^x )(x^2 J_   _ ^x )
  _ ^0  _ ^0   (x^2)^J+2  
 Z ^J+2 (x) Z^J+2 (0) 
4J^3 N_0 ^J+2  

 
&=& 
_  _  + _  _ 
  . 
Unlike sugranorm1 , 
this expression is  consistent with an operator-supergravity-state 
correspondence. This is the first consistency check of our proposal
newbarq  and inner-corresp .


We now move on to consider
string states, and compute in the free theory the
two-point function 

in the limit . 
To this end, it is convenient to observe that 
the only terms which survive in this overlap
are the ones where one  derivative operator
originating from the barred operator and one from the unbarred operator 
act on the same propagator, 

.
For these terms 
.(x^2 J_ _ ^x )  
_ ^y  x^2 (x-y)^2  _y=0  = 
.(x^2 J_ _ ^x )  x^2 
2(x-y)_ (x-y)^4   _y=0 


= 2   _ ,
where we have used that , and 
.
Keeping this in mind, one easily computes 

in the limit ,
 _, n ^J (x) _, m ^J (0)
&=& 
( J  )^2   
4J^2 ( g^2 2 (4^2) )^J+2  N^J+2             
(_m,n _ _   + _m,-n _ _  )

 &=& 
_m,n _ _   + _m,-n _ _ 
 .
This result is  again consistent with our operator-string state 
correspondence inner-corresp . This is the second, nontrivial  
consistency check of our proposal 
newbarq  and inner-corresp .
The normalisation chosen in opndef  was designed to lead,
on the right hand side of stringoverl ,
to the product of Kronecker deltas with coefficient equal to 1 .



A few general remarks  are in order:


1.  
In distinction with Eqs. (29a)-(29d) of, in our case  
stringoverl , the overlap between  supergravity and string states 
vanishes.

 
2.  On general grounds, conformal invariance requires 
that the two-point function of vector conformal primary operators 
of scaling dimension  should have the form:
_, n ^J   (x) _, m ^J (0)= 
const.   _m,n J_ J_   + _m,-n J_ J_  x^2  
 . 
In our approach, we  amputate the coordinate dependence 
on the right hand side of conf2 , and contract vector indices with 
(appropriate tensor products of) the inversion tensor , 
thus directly computing

_x    x^2   
J_  J_   
 _, n ^J   (x) _, m ^J (0)= 
_m,n _ _   + _m,-n _ _ 
 , 
see our result stringoverl . 
We take the limit  because  of the barred-operator 

is the inversion of  and, in the radial quantisation formalism, 
states are obtained from operators at the point .
The corresponding state in radial quantisation would be
0  (_ ^'  O_ ^' ) (x'=0)  = 
_x   
0  (x^2 J_ (x) 
_ )[x^2  O_ ^ (x)]  ,

which is precisely our definition. 
The two-point functions of vector operators are now correctly normalised, 
and take the canonical form. As a result, they 
are suited for a correspondence with 
the (orthonormal) string theory basis of states.



3. 
For the BMN operators with scalar impurities, 
_i j , n ^J =

_scalar (
_l=0 ^J  e^2i nl J  [
_i  Z^l _j Z^J-l  ]
 -  ^ij   (Z  Z^J+1 ))
 +   ,
one can follow the same  procedure as above, 
and define  the barred-operators as
.

Obviously, whether or not we introduce an inversion for the scalar fields 
is rather irrelevant: 
all the previous results for scalar Green functions are
modified in a straightforward manner 
and the relation inner-corresp  is verified.
However,  
as we have shown, this leads to  
important differences for vector operators. 


4.  
It has been 

argued already in 
that 
the vector conformal primary BMN operators, i.e. 
-BMN operators with various numbers of vector impurities
are bosonic supersymmetry descendants of the scalar
conformal primary BMN operators. For example,
vector operators opndef 
can be obtained from scalar operators opscalar 
by acting twice with supersymmetry transformations.
Supersymmetry is important as
it ensures that BMN operators with 
one vector and one scalar impurity or  
two vector impurities have  the same anomalous dimension
as BMN operators with two scalar impurities,,
in agreement with string theory expectations.





Three-point functions of 
vector conformal primary BMN operators 


Conformal invariance constrains the expression of  three-point functions of 
conformal primary operators. 

For the particular class of three-point functions 

,
involving 
vector conformal primary operators with , one has

_, n ^J_1 (x_1) 
_vac ^J_2 (x_2)  _, m ^J  (x_3) =
F( _n _-n , vac  _m _-m  ; x_13 )
(x_12 )^_1 + _2 - _3 
(x_13  )^_1 + _3 - _2   
(x_23 )^_2 + _3 - _1   
 
 , 
where , 
's 

are the scaling dimensions of 
,  and 
 respectively;

and  is a
dimensionless function of . 
In the quantum theory, 
, 
, 
, where 
 ,   are the anomalous dimensions of 
, .
Therefore
 _1 + _2 - _3 &=& _n  -_m  , 

_1 + _3 - _2 &=& 2(J_1 + 2 ) + _n + _m  ,

_2 + _3 - _1 &=& 2J_2 + _m  -_n  . 
Notice that the anomalous dimensions for 
vector conformal primary operators with one vector and one scalar impurity 
  or with two vector impurities are the same as for 
the original BMN operators with two scalar impurities. 

Conformal invariance requires

to depend on the vector indices , , ,  
through appropriate tensorial products of the inversion tensor,
 , thus it contains -dependence
(See, e.g. , section III.2 of.)   
and cannot be compared directly to 
the coefficient  of the scalar three-point function
3pt , nor with a three-string interaction vertex.
As in the previous section, we propose to consider instead 
the three-point functions involving the barred-operators 
and, moreover, to work in the limit
(As before, the limit is a consequence of 
the formalism of radial quantisation. 
We also note that translational invariance, 
broken by radial quantisation, is restored in this limit.) 
. 














Using our definition newbar  for the barred-operator, 
we will therefore compute 
_, n ^J_1 (x_1) 
_vac ^J_2 (x_2)  _, m ^J  (x_3) 
&&

(x_3)^2_3 
_, n ^J_1 (x_1) 
_vac ^J_2 (x_2)  _, m ^J  (x_3) 
&=& 
C( _n _-n , vac  _m _-m )
(x_12 )^_n - _m 

 
 ,

for  (and ,  finite), where
 and 
are given by 

opndef  and newbarq .

This is one of the key observation of this paper. 
Now  
can be compared directly 
to the scalar three-point function coefficient
, defined below. 

 
The three-point functions of  BMN operators with scalar impurities
opscalar  have the form
_k l, n ^J_1 (x_1) 
_vac ^J_2 (x_2)  _i j , m ^J  (x_3) = 
C( k_n l_-n , vac  i_m j_-m )(x_12 )^_1 + _2 - _3 
(x_13  )^_1 + _3 - _2   
(x_23 )^_2 + _3 - _1   
 
 ,
or, introducing the barred-operators and working in the limit
 (and ,  finite),
_k l, n ^J_1 (x_1) 
_vac ^J_2 (x_2)  _i j , m ^J  (x_3) = 
C( k_n l_-n , vac  i_m j_-m )(x_12 )^_n - _m  
 .
The expression for   the coefficient  of the 
three-point function for BMN operators with 
two scalar impurities is 

C( k_n l_-n , vac  i_m j_-m )
=
C_123 ^vac 2^2(m y) y ^2 (m^2-n^2/y^2)^2 
(_i(k _l)j m^2+_i[k _l]j m n y +
1 4 _ij _kl  n^2 y^2 )  , 









where  is the R-charge ratio, 

and the symmetric traceless and  antisymmetric traceless combinations of 
two Kronecker deltas  are defined as
 
These results were first obtained 
in the simple case  in. 
The general expression twoi1 
was derived in .


We now explain how the computation of the vector three-point functions
proceeds.
In subsection 3.1  we will describe the free-theory computation, 
and devote  3.2  to the planar corrections at one-loop. 
In order to efficiently organise our analysis, we will make a 
step-by-step comparison  with the known computation for  the case of 
scalar impurities. 
More precisely, our strategy will consist in identifying 
the "building blocks" which lead to the expression 
twoi1  for the coefficient 

 of the three-point function of scalar BMN operators, 
and show that the corresponding building blocks for the 
case of BMN operators with vector impurities 
are precisely the same. 
In this way we will establish the equality 
between 
and the coefficient  
of the vector three-point function
(after interchanging the indices of the two  groups).
This will also prove the  symmetry 
at the level of three-point functions.





The calculation in free theory 
Let us briefly review the free theory computation for
the three-point function with 

(complex)
scalar impurities,
(For the considerations in free theory presented in  this section, 
we can set all anomalous dimensions equal to zero.)  
say  and . 
For calculations with scalars we use the complex basis
compbas , but continue calling the BMN operators
as  and 
. 

Obviously, to get a nonzero result an impurity in the barred operator 

must be contracted with an impurity in 
 
and the result boils down to the evaluation of the 
Feynman diagram in Figure 1, which gives

free-scalar:   ( g^2 2   )^2 
1  (4^2 x_31 ^2)^2 
P_free   .
The  factor 
comes from carefully summing the BMN phase factors 
over all the position of 
 and 

impurities in the operators. 
Its explicit form is given in Appendix B, and will not be needed here. 

When , freescal  is the only contribution to the 
three-point function at the  free level. When 
the mixing with multi-trace operators must be taken into account
 and will modify even free theory results 
at leading order in .

These mixing effects being added to the contributions of Figure 1
lead to the result of
twoi1 .

We now consider the vector impurity case. 
First, notice that,  in the free theory, 
covariant derivatives can be replaced with simple derivatives. 
The second  key observation is that, 
in the limit we are considering ( and ,  finite), 
the only nonvanishing contractions are those where an impurity 
in the operator 
is  connected to an impurity in 
.
The result of such contractions 
has been analysed in imptoimp . This observation leads to 
the immediate conclusion that there is only 
one  Feynman diagram contributing  to 
the free vector impurity case (Figure 2). 
The associated phase factor is the same as for the scalar impurity case 
of Figure 1. Therefore the free theory result 
for the vector three-point function is 
given by (apart from an irrelevant normalisation)
free-vector:  2 ( g^2 2   )^2 

1   (4^2 x_31 ^2)^2   


P_free 
 .


The overall factor of two in freevec ,
which is not present in  freescal ,
is the effect of  the  factor of two on the right hand side of  
imptoimp .  It is precisely cancelled by the normalisation 
defofc  for vector conformal operators.
( 
In this respect, notice that precisely for this reason 
the normalisation constant  for vector BMN operators is 
half the normalisation of the scalars,
.
) 
After taking into account these different normalisations,
the free result freevec  for vector BMN operators leads to the same 
result as for the scalars (see freescal ).


As in the scalar case, there are mixing effects of the 
barred single-trace operator with barred double-trace operators.  
These mixing effects will affect the free-theory contribution of
Figure 2. However, as we argued above, in the region 
, the vector impurities inside a BMN operator are
orthonormal to each other with respect to the inner product
inner , and hence behave in the same way as scalar impurities
inside a BMN operator. As a result, 
it is easy to convince oneself that the modifications due to mixing
effects  to the free-theory
three-point function coefficient
are the same for both the scalar and the vector case.
Hence, the free three-point function with vector impurities 
reproduces precisely its counterpart for the case of scalar impurities.


Before concluding this section,  
we would like to discuss further the issue of  mixing. 
The mixing of single-trace BMN operators
with double-trace operators is crucial in order  to obtain conformal 
expressions such as  confvector  (orconfvector2 ). 
However, here we are not concerned with deriving  the conformal expression
on the right hand side of  confvector , which must be correct anyway,
as far as the mixing effects are such that we are dealing
with vector conformal primary operators. Our goal is rather to compute
the coefficient of the three-point function with two non-chiral operators, 
.
At leading order in , the only mixing effect which contributes to 
the right hand side of  confvector  
(or confvector2 )
is the mixing of the barred operator with double-trace operators
(To see it immediately, note that the double-trace corrections 
to the single-trace expression for 
a BMN operator is of , i.e. suppressed
with . This can be compensated by factorising the three-point function 
into a product of two two-point functions. This is possible only 
for the double-trace mixing in the operator .
) 
.  These mixing effects will affect
not only the free-theory contribution to
,  
but also the logarithmic terms  and  
due to interactions of
the double-trace corrections in  
with the BMN operators sitting at  and . However, it is important to
note that these mixing effects cannot affect
the remaining logarithm,  . 
Hence the coefficient of this logarithm can be computed in planar 
perturbation theory at order  without taking into account mixing 
altogether.

Our programme will therefore consist in assuming the conformal form 
(rather than deriving it), and evaluating the terms proportional 
to , thus  determining the full coefficient 
of the vector three-point function.
In doing so we are allowed to neglect the double-trace corrections, 
and work directly with the original single-trace BMN expressions.

 








The calculation in the interacting theory   
The observations made at the end of the last section 
allow us to limit ourselves to the  Feynman diagrams which can generate a 
 term. Notice that self-energy corrections 
cannot generate such a  dependence, 
and will thus be completely irrelevant for our purposes.

Interacting "mirror" diagrams. 
 

To begin with, let us recall the situation in the case of scalar impurities.
In that case there are  two diagrams contributing 
to this process, see Figure 3. 
They  come from an
F-term in the Lagrangian, 

. 
In the first diagram (type I) the impurity goes across, 
and the diagram comes with coefficient 
. In the second diagram  
the impurity goes straight (type II), and the diagram  has a  coefficient  
. 
 The terms proportional to the  resulting  from 
these two diagrams are given by
(To keep the formulae as simple as possible, 
we write down only  multiplicative factors of  and
 coming from 
the vertices and the propagators involved in the interaction.)

 ,
where the function  is  
X = 
- 1

2^8 ^6 x_31 ^4 x_12 ^2
 ,
see X1234  and X  of Appendix A for further details. 
The overall factor  comes from the insertion of 
one vertex , 
and four propagators, . 
The factors of  coming from the propagators are already 
included in the definition of .  Finally,  and  
are the factors associated with the diagrams of type I and II, 
respectively. They are given in Appendix B, and their form will not be 
essential for the following
analysis.


The diagrams drawn in Figure 3 are also accompanied by "mirror" diagrams,
where the interaction occurs in the bottom part of the external circle 
(which represents the  barred trace operator) instead 

of  
in the upper part. These diagrams are represented in  Figure 4. 

Their effect is to add to the 
phase factors  and  their complex conjugates, 
 and . Finally, there are also the diagrams 
where the interaction involves the impurity   instead of . 
The net effect of these diagrams is to double up each phase factor, so that 
and amounts to replacing  and  in typeIF  and 
typeIIF  respectively by  and 
.









Notice that 
typeIF  and typeIIF 
must be compared to the free result, 
which was computed in freescal .



We have now assembled the building blocks Eqs. typeIF , typeIIF 
for deriving the formula twoi1  for the case of 
different scalar impurities (, ).
In fact, the derivation of twoi1  follows immediately 
by tracking the  terms. 
For the case of same impurities, one cannot use the complex basis 
in order to derive twoi1 , but a straightforward modification 
of the above  shows that twoi1  holds.



Having identified the building blocks for the
scalar-impurities calculation, we are finally ready to study 
the vector-impurities interacting case.

The diagrams where the interaction does not include either of the impurities  
cancel among each other in
both the scalar and  the vector cases.


We are thus left with only two classes of diagrams, 
in complete analogy with the scalar case: 
in the diagrams of the first class, represented in Figure 5, 
the impurity goes across (type I), 
whereas for those in the second class, in Figure 6, 
the impurity goes straight (type II). From 
these diagrams it follows immediately that 
the phase factor associated 
with type I (II) vector diagrams is the same 
as for the corresponding diagrams of type I (II) for scalars.
To establish the  symmetry we only need 
to compare the coefficients of the scalar and vector diagrams. 



Let us have a closer look at the diagrams of type I
(impurity goes across).
The first diagram in Figure 5

comes  from a  D-term in the Lagrangian, 

. 
Importantly, it has the same sign of the  
F-term contributing to the same class of diagram for the scalar case, 

.
Its contribution is 
+  ( 2 g^2 )
( g^2 2   )^4 P_I 
 X 
 . 
The second diagram in Figure 5 is evaluated in Hvanish 
Appendix A and gives a vanishing contribution. 
The third diagram  is the gluon emission from the impurity, 
and comes from the commutator term in the covariant derivative impurity

in  .
This diagram is also evaluated in Ydiag  of  
Appendix A, 
and the result is:  
+3 
( 2 g^2 )^2( g^2 2   )^5  
P_I   X
 . 
The total answer for the diagrams of type I 
is therefore equal to
type  I-vector:  +4  ( g^2 2   )^3 
P_I    X  . 
As in the scalar case, the inclusion of mirror diagrams 
and of the diagrams where the interaction occurs where 
the other impurity is located, 
amounts to replacing   in typeIV  with  
. 

This result typeIV 
has to be compared to the free result, which has been computed in 
freevec . 
Taking into account the normalisations of the operators
as explained after freevec  (i.e. dividing typeIV 
by a factor of two), 
the coefficient  term typeIV  arising 
from the  diagrams of type I 
precisely coincides with the corresponding  
coefficient for type I diagrams for 
scalar three-point functions, 
typeIF .





We now consider the diagrams of type II (Figure 6).

The first and second one originate from the two terms contained in   


 respectively, 
and have opposite signs.

The second diagram carries a symmetry factor 2 compared to the first and
their spatial dependence is the same. 
Their combined result is equal to 
(1-2) ( 2 g^2 ) ( g^2 2   )^4 
P_II  X 
 . 
The third and fourth diagram come with opposite signs 
and have the same spatial dependence, 
therefore their net contribution vanishes.
The fifth diagram vanishes by itself, as the second diagram in 
Figure 5.   
The sixth diagram  follows from a  contribution 
from the commutator term 

in the covariant-derivative impurity present in 
. The sign of this diagram is opposite to 
to the similar one of type I
(the third in Figure 5),  however this time it comes with phase factor 
. Its contribution is  therefore equal to 
-3  ( 2 g^2 )^2
( g^2 2   )^5
 P_II  X 
 . 
The final  result for the diagrams of type II is
type  II-vector:  -4  ( g^2 2   )^3 
P_II    X  . 
Including  mirror diagrams 
and  the diagrams where the interaction occurs where 
the other impurities is located, 
amounts to replacing   in typeIIV  with  
.
As before, typeIIV  
is to be compared to the free result
freevec . 

Taking into account the normalisations of the operators,
i.e. dividing by two,
as we did previously for the type I diagrams and the free case (see 
the discussion after
freevec  and typeIV ), 
the coefficient of the  term typeIIV  
from the  diagrams of type II 
precisely matches the corresponding coefficient from 
type II diagrams for the scalar three-point functions, 
typeIIF .



Summarising, the building blocks 
typeIV  and  typeIIV 
for deriving the expression for the 
vector three-point function coefficient 

are precisely the same  as the building blocks 
typeIF , typeIIF  for 
the scalar three-point function coefficient
, 
which in turn lead to the expression 
twoi1 . Therefore, it follows that 

is given by an expression which has the same form as
twoi1 :

C( _n _-n , vac  _m _-m )
=
C_123 ^vac 2^2(m y) y ^2 (m^2-n^2/y^2)^2 
(_( _) m^2+
_[ _] m n y +
1 4 _ _  n^2 y^2 )  .
This is one of the principal results of this paper(We
note that twoivec  differs from the expression proposed
in) .


Three-point functions with one vector and one scalar impurity 


The case of BMN operators with mixed impurities 
(one scalar and one vector impurity) 
is now straightforward  solve as well. 
These BMN operators were first considered in and 
have the form

_i , n ^J =

_mixed  ( _l=0 ^J e^2i nl J  [ 
( D_ Z) Z^l _i Z^J-l  ]+ 
[ D_ _i Z^J+1 ])  +   ,
where  
is the appropriate normalisation constant, and the dots,
as always, stand for 
multi-trace corrections and other mixing effects
at higher orders in .
We consider three-point functions of the form  
_j , n ^J_1 (x_1) 
_vac ^J_2 (x_2)  _i , m ^J  (x_3) = 
C( j_n _-n , vac  i_m _-m )(x_12 )^_n - _m  
 ,
where, similarly to the analysis for vector operators, 
we have introduced barred-operators and work in the limit
 (and ,  finite).
The computations of the previous sections can be
applied directly for this case, and the result for 
the three-point function coefficient is given by

C( j_n _-n , vac  i_m _-m )= 
C_123 ^vac 2^2(m y) y ^2 (m^2-n^2/y^2)^2  
12 _ij _ ( m^2  + mny )
 . 

We note that the index structure of twoimix  is simpler than 
in twoi1  since in the mixed impurity case one should not consider
symmetric, antisymmetric and the singlet cases, hence there is
only one combination of Kronecker deltas, .


Equation twoimix  is another principal result of this paper.
In distinction with twoivec , it is not a consequence
of the  symmetry 
of the pp-wave string theory which interchanges 
scalar with vector impurities.
It is pleasing that 
the expression on the right hand side of  twoimix 
agrees precisely with the prediction of the vertex-correlator
duality formula of.



****** 

In this paper, we have introduced a new notion of 
conjugation to define 

BMN operators with negative R-charge. 
The new conjugation is a composition of the usual hermitian conjugation 
with an inversion, and is entirely
consistent with the spirit of radial quantization. Using this
conjugation, we introduced a new inner product for the BMN operators, 
which is relevant for the pp-wave/SYM correspondence. 
We computed three-point functions for BMN operators with vector impurities.

Combining our previous vertex-correlator duality relation 
and the  symmetry, we make a prediction for the three-point
functions of BMN operators with two vector impurities. Our field
theory  results verify it.  This is yet another non-trivial 
consistency  check  of the  vertex-correlator correspondence,
including the expression for the string field theory prefactor 
used in .
It will be interesting to see how this expression 
can be derived in string theory from first principles.

Appendix A:


Evaluation of the diagrams 

In the computation of the scalar three-point functions we define 
the function   
X_1234  = d^4z  
(x_1 - z) (x_2 - z) (x_3 - z) (x_4 - z) 
  .
 develops  a  term   
as  approaches ,
which is given by  
X = 

- 1 2^9 ^6  

 ( 1x_13 ^2 x_24 ^2  + 
1x_14 ^2 x_23 ^2  )x_12 ^2
 .
In the evaluation of all the diagrams with an insertion of 
quadrilinear term in the scalars coming from 
we also made use of the following relations: 
[ J_ (x_3)_ ^x_3  x_3^2  
_ ^x^1   X_1234 ]_x_3 = x_4   
&&   _  X  , 

 [ J_ (x_4)_ ^x_4  x_4^2  
_ ^x^1   X_1234 ]_x_3 = x_4   
&&  _  X  , 
where equality with the right hand sides holds 
for the  terms,  in the limit
 and , and we used
_  x_  x^2  = J_ (x) x^2 
 .
The covariant derivative interaction term, which participates in 
the third diagram  of Figure 5 and in the sixth diagram of Figure 6, 
is proportional to 
, where
Y_123  = d^4z  
(x_1 - z) (x_2 - z) (x_3 - z) 
 .
It is easy to realise that, as , the function 
contains a logarithmic term   given by

Y = - 1 2^7 ^4   
 ( 1 x_13 ^2   + 
1x_23 ^2  )x_12 ^2
 .
To compute the diagram, we also used that, as ,  
[J_ (x_3 ) _ ^x_3    x_3 ^2 ] 
( _ ^x_2  - _ ^x_3 ) Y_123  
3 X  _  
 .
The contribution of the second diagram in Figure 5 (gluon interaction)
is encoded in the function  defined by
H_14,23  = 
(_ ^x_1  -  _ ^x_4 )
(_ ^x_2  -  _ ^x_3 )
d^4 z   d^4 t  (x_1 - z ) (x_4 - z )   
  (x_2 - t ) (x_3 - t )                 
(z - t )
 , 
which can be evaluated with the useful relation  proved in 
H_14,23  _14 _23   = 
X_1234  ( 1_12 _43   -1_13 _24   ) + 
G_1,23  - G_4,23 +G_2,14 -G_3,14 
  ,
where  and 
G_i,jk = Y_ijk ( 1 _ik   - 1 _ij  )
 .
We can recast H  as
H_14,23  &=& -X_1234  _14 _23 _13 _24   
 +  
( Y_123  _13   +  Y_124  _24   )
_14 _23   +  

 &= & H_I   +  H_II  +  
  ,
where the dots stand for terms which either vanish or do not contain the  
.

The vanishing of the second diagram in Figure 5 stems from the fact that
[ J_ (x_3) _ ^x_3  x_3^2]  _ ^x_1  H_I   
 = 
- [J_ (x_3) _ ^x_3  x_3^2]  _ ^x_1  H_II  
 ,
where the equality holds for the   terms we are looking at, 

and in the limit .



Appendix B:

Summing the BMN phase factors 
For completeness, we report here the expressions for the 
coefficients ,  and  
which arise after summing over the BMN phase factors 
in the free-theory diagrams and in the diagrams of type I and II, 
respectively. Defining 

q = e^2i m J   , 

q_1 = e^2i n J_1   ,
we have, for the free case, 




 P_free  = _k,l=0 ^J_1   (q  q_1)^l-k  + 
_l=0 ^J_1     (q  q_1)^0   =  
J^2 ^2  ^2 m y (m-  ny )^2 
 +  (J)  ,
where the last equality holds in the BMN limit, and .
The expressions for  and  are given by 



P_I  = _l=0 ^J_1   (q  q_1)^l 
 q   , 
P_II  = _l=0 ^J_1   (q  q_1)^l 
 . 
The effective coefficient which  multiplies
the  term in  the three-point function, 
both in the scalar and in the vector case,  is
2(P_I  + P _I ) - 2(P_II  + P _II ) 
&=& 
2 _l=0 ^J_1   (q  q_1)^l   (q  - 1 )
 +   c.c.  

  &=&
 - 8 m m - ny    ^2 m y
 . 
Again, the last equality holds in the BMN limit. Notice that 
totalpf  is of  compared with  in 
pfree , as it should. This, together with a factor  of 
with the planar one-loop contribution to the three-point function,  
reconstruct the effective Yang-Mills coupling constant , 
which is kept  fixed in the BMN limit.

To conclude this section we notice that, 
as in the case of BMN operators with scalar impurities, we expect that 
all the diagrams where the interaction does not involve either 
of the impurities should sum up to zero. 
This is a particular case of the cancellation of D-terms against 
gluon diagrams and self-energies.
The cancellation is very easy to explain also 
in the case where vector impurities are concerned.
Again, we concentrate only on the diagrams which can develop  
a  dependence, 
as these are the only one which 
can be computed without knowing the precise form of the 
mixing of single-trace  with multi-trace operators, 
as discussed earlier. 
Moreover, notice that self-energies
cannot generate the required logarithmic dependence at the perturbative 
order we are considering, and hence  will be ignored altogether.

The relevant Feynman diagrams are shown in Figure 7, 
and have all  the same phase factor. 
The first diagram comes with a symmetry factor two, and precisely 
cancels the sum of the second with the third diagram, which have 
opposite sign (as it can be easily seen from ) 
and the same spatial dependence.
Similarly, the fourth diagram cancels the fifth one, 
and finally the sixth cancels the seventh.
