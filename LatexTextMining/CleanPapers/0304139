Abstract 
12pt
Following earlier work  by Polyakov and Gubser, Klebanov and Polyakov,
 we attempt to clarify  the structure of  vertex 
operators representing  particular string  states 
which  have large ("semiclassical") values of 
AdS energy or 4-d dimension  
and angular momentum  in  or spin   in .
We comment on  the meaning of semiclassical limit in the context 
of  perturbative expansion for the 
2-d anomalous dimensions of the corresponding vertex operators.
We consider in  detail the leading-order 1-loop 
renormalization of these operators in  
 sigma model 
(ignoring fermionic contributions). We  find 
 more examples of operators  (in addition to  the one 
in hep-th/0110196) for which the  1-loop anomalous dimension 
can be made small by tuning  quantum numbers. 
We also  comment on  a possibility of deriving the 
semiclassical relation between  and  or   
from the marginality condition for the vertex operators, 
using  a stationary phase approximation in  the path integral 
expression for their 2-point correlator on a complex plane.

Introduction 


One of the 
important  issues  in gauge theory - string theory duality is 
to  understand
 the precise  formulation
of the relation between observables on the two sides of 
the duality
beyond the supergravity (chiral primary) mode sector.
Progress in that direction was initiated
in ,, .
A  natural   expectation   
 is that each on-shell string state  or
 marginal string vertex operator in  string theory 
should be associated with a local 
gauge-invariant  operator  in =4 SYM theory
with definite   conformal dimension  
( are global charges and  is the 
't Hooft coupling).A related 
 formulation or manifestation of duality
is the equality of the gauge theory and string theory 
expectation values for a  Wilson loop
,,,, . 
Then  the original suggestion of ,  implies   that
one is supposed  to relate  correlators of local
gauge-invariant conformal operators  on the gauge theory
 side  with  elements of string "S-matrix" in AdS, i.e. with 
correlators of the appropriate local 
string vertex operators  
(having the same  quantum numbers and  corresponding to a 
specific  choice of  boundary conditions).



Our aim here is to try to shed light on 
 the structure 
of  string vertex operators  corresponding  to particular string states 
in with  large 
values of  energy   in global coordinates 
(equal to  4-d  dimension ) 
 and   global charges   (e.g., angular momentum  in  
 or  spin  in ).
 We shall be guided by  the previous work in this direction 
in ,  (see also )  and  by 
the predictions   
for  for the associated 
semiclassical string states.


In  it was suggested  that  a spinning string state 
represented by  the classical solution for a long rotating string
in AdS    may  be related,  in the limit of large spin , 
to the minimal twist    operators
on the gauge theory side. An evidence in favour of this proposal 
is the scaling of the dimension  
 as 
  S + c_1 S +....  
   for large 
in the two  limits ( and )
 of the duality,  as well as the
absence ,  of higher-order  corrections
on the string side to all orders in the 
inverse string tension ().
Similar behaviour   was found  also 
(in the limit of large )
  for a stretched string rotating in . 

In flat space
one may  represent a spinning 
string state on the  leading Regge trajectory
either  by a local vertex operator 
, 
  
 (or as a Fock space state 
  )
or, if the spin  is of   order of string tension, 
by a semiclassical  state
described  by a "solitonic" rotating string
solution (in Fock space this is a 
coherent state exp
 with respect to  the
elementary  oscillator vacuum).


By analogy,  one should expect that the same  relation 
as found for  the "solitonic"  rotating string solution in AdS 
should  be found also  for 
an  "elementary"  string state  created by a
 local vertex operator 
with the same  energy   and spin  
(and having the  correct flat-space limit  representing 
state on a leading Regge trajectory).
The solutions in  
should be associated with 
 closed string states on the  2-d cylinder.
 Via the standard  conformal mapping,  
they may be expected to  be in correspondence 
with states created by the two vertex operators inserted 
 on a complex plane 
with the  "mass-shell"  condition  
 following  from the 
marginality condition of the vertex operators.


Identifying  string   vertex operators  
 in superstring theory is, in general, 
  a complicated 
task. First, they  may  have a  non-trivial
 dependence on fermions.
In addition, 
vertex operators in curved space may 
 in general depend on .
However, one may hope that in  the semiclassical approximation
considered in , i.e. () 

   =fixed 
 ,          Q =q=
fixed 
 ,       1   1  ,       Q= J  or   S  ,  
 where  
 is related to the effective string tension  
,  there may be some simplifications.  
In particular, 
given that the spinning classical solution in   involved 
only the bosonic AdS 
 part of the string theory, 
the result for   may be universal,  i.e. 
it may not be sensitive to the  fermionic part of 
the vertex operator
and  details of   factor. 
With this expectation 
 we shall concentrate below only on  bosonic parts of the 
corresponding operators.


Instead of computing the form of the marginality condition 
for  a spinning string   vertex operator 
directly in perturbation theory in  
one may hope that in the  limit of large  and  
the relation  may be derived  by using semiclassical approximation 
in the string path integral on the 2-sphere (complex plane) 
with two  insertions  of the  vertex operators  .
This  idea works indeed in the case of a point-like string mode
(supergravity state)  
with large  orbital momentum   , .
One could then try  to 
follow the same logic  in the spinning  case, i.e. start with 
the 2-point function  of unintegrated
operators on a 2-sphere,   

 compute the dependence on the 2-d distance  
in the semiclassical  approximation
and show that insisting that the 2-point 
correlator  scales as  
implies the same relation
 as found  in .


 Such computation  can indeed be 
 done for a spinning string state  in flat space 
  where, as we shall  explain below,  
it  leads indeed to the Regge trajectory relation 
.


Indeed, 
since in the semiclassical limit    scales as string tension,
 one expects the 2-point correlator to be
saturated by a classical trajectory  which should be
closely related  to the rotating  string solution  in .
The discussion   in   applied to 
string theory in Minkowski-signature  AdS space
defined on a 2-d  Minkowski-signature cylinder.
This describes propagation of a particular closed  string
mode in real time.  The vertex-operator 2-point
computation  done on Euclidean 2-sphere
may be mapped onto Euclidean 2-cylinder with the vertex
operators specifying a particular  string state
propagating on the cylinder.
It is natural to expect that 
the relevant semiclassical trajectory should then be a (complex
and conformally transformed)
analog of the one in . As already apparent  in
the  case , , one should not
 attribute a special meaning to the
complex nature of the semiclassical trajectory
saturating path integral (cf. ).
 An imaginary  nature of it may be related  to 
 external
sources one puts in to specify the required
 boundary/initial  conditions.
Like in the case of a euclidean gaussian path integral
 with imaginary sources   the result is an analytic function of 
   so that  one can make analytic continuations. 
Presumably, the role of the two  vertex operators  is only  to
insert proper boundary conditions in mapping the 2-sphere back 
to the cylinder, while their 
detailed pre-exponential form should not be  that
important.
Unfortunately, we were  not be able  to find   a  precise 
implementation of this idea  in the  (or ) 
spinning string  case.  



 One may wonder  how the expression for  found  in semiclassical 
approximation may be related  to the direct computation 
of the 2-d anomalous dimension of the corresponding vertex operator  in 
sigma model perturbation theory in .  
In general, an eigenvalue of the anomalous dimension 
matrix   
for the operator  at level (i.e. with  number of 2-d  derivatives) 
equal to   and with quantum numbers  and   is
 expected to have the structure



+  
 1 ()^2   ( b_1  ^3 + b_2  Q^3 +  b_3 ^2 + b_4 Q^2 +  b_5 + b_6 Q)
+ ... +  
 1 ()^n   ( c_1  ^n+1   + c_2  Q^n+1   +  ...) + ...  .  
The marginality condition 
  
should then produce a complicated   relation 
. 
Equivalent relation should follow from solving the generalized 
Klein-Gordon type   equation  

 for the corresponding wave function , with the operator  
   
representing  the functional form  of the anomalous
 dimension operator  , . 
 
While determining the detailed form of higher order corrections 
in   is in  general a very complicated problem depending   
 on  details 
of both the superstring action and  particular vertex  operator, 
 a  semiclassical path integral computation of the 
 anomalous dimension 
would  bypass this problem, effectively 
summing up leading terms in  from each order  in .
That all orders in  should be contributing  is obvious  
from the form of the semiclassical relation  found in  
in the limit : 
. 
Indeed, assuming that   and  scale with  as in  
    and thus keeping only the leading terms 
in  and  at each order in  one finds from   

= 2 - f(,q) +  h(,q) + O(1  )   ,  


 so that the  leading-order 
 solution of  condition at large  should 
 be determined  by solving , which gives 
  .
Remarkably, the 
 semiclassical argument should thus be effectively 
 determining  the whole function  
which  contains information coming from all higher-order
  sigma  model 
loop corrections to the anomalous dimension. 

One may expect that  some features of the semiclassical relation  for 
  can be seen already in the  perturbative  expansion . 
For example,  one would be able to  deduce 
that  at large 
 provided  each   of the  expansion  terms
 in  would have the form 
. In particular,  
the one-loop  correction 
would  then  to  start with  , similarly 
 to  what happens in the example (corresponding to 
  a scalar string 
state)  pointed out  in . 
As  we shall discuss below, such "difference of squares"
form of the leading 1-loop correction to the 2-d anomalous 
dimension is indeed  characteristic also 
to vertex operators representing  spinning  string states.
However, the  relative coefficient of the two terms
in the difference does not turn out to be exactly one. 
One possibility is that the precise value of this 1-loop coefficient 
depends in fcat  on the ignored  contribution of the fermionic terms 
(both in the string sigma model action 
and the vertex operator).
An alternative explanation is that one is first to sum all 
orders in  to determine the function 
 in  and then  find  
only after solving . 

















We shall start in section 2 with a review of the
simple   orbital  rotation case , .
We shall  then consider in section 3 
the semiclassical  path integral derivation of the  relation
for spinning string vertex operator in flat space.

In section 4 we shall describe the
expected   structure of vertex operators 
corresponding to string rotating in  and to string rotating in .
We shall then sketch a possible generalization of 
the semiclassical argument in flat space to the case of the string 
spinning in . 
 
 With the motivation to find the  precise structure 
 of the spinning string vertex operators in in  section 5 we
  shall study in detail the 1-loop renormalisation of composite 
  operators in N invariant bosonic sigma model. We shall 
 follow  and  apply the method of . 
  We shall find that in general the vertex operators are given by 
  mixtures  
  of various possible operators of the same canonical dimension
  and spin, with 1-loop corrected  eigenvalues of the anomalous dimension 
  matrix  having  a "difference of squares"  structure
  as in the example considered in .
  Assuming  that higher loop corrections will  have similar structure, 
  this seems to be in  qualitative agreement 
   with the 
  semiclassical results of   ( and )
   for the corresponding string states on a 2-d cylinder.
  
  
 
  
 
 
 

Case of orbital angular momentum in  : review 



Comments on scalar vertex operators in   


Let us briefly review  some  relevant points
regarding  the general structure
of  integrated and unintegrated vertex operators in AdS space 
.
In any curved background  we can define  string vertex
operators  as perturbations of string sigma model action  that
solve the conformal invariance  (marginality) conditions. The latter 
are analogs of curved space Laplace equation with various
 corrections. These equations are known explicitly in very few
cases (gauged WZW models, etc). As discussed above,
for certain types of string modes  the
 semiclassical approach
may allow  one to fix implicitly the form of the leading terms 
in  these equations,  i.e. to determine
their solutions  with proper boundary conditions
and thus  determine the  space-time dimensions of the associated
CFT operators.


Ignoring -corrections, a scalar mode like dilaton
 should satisfy the KG equation   
   in .
 To define  vertex operators leading to 
an analog of "S-matrix" we need to  
 specify  appropriate  boundary conditions  , . 
In flat space  the relevant solutions are  
   plane waves with fixed momentum, i.e. vertex operators
 contain factors of .
  In AdS,  while
 a 2-d  conformal  vertex   is  any  

 where    solves  the  KG equation,
 we  need  to choose a specific solution.
 The  required one is  () 

T(x) = d^4 x'  K(x, x')  T_0 ( x')  ,      
x= (z,  x)  ,      
ds^2 =  dz^2 + dx_dx_z^2  .  
Here    is any "source"
 function  at the boundary of AdS,  
  is the  Dirichlet bulk to boundary propagator,
     K = c()  [ z z^2 + (x-x')^2 ]^ ,       
K_z0  ^(4)   (x-x')  ,   
and  is determined from  the condition
 .
 The  vertex operator that
 enters the expressions for string correlators  is the 
"unintegrated one" -
the one  integrated over the 2-d world sheet
 but depending (instead of the usual  momentum) on a point
  at the  boundary of AdS:
  V(x)  =
 d^2   ()  ,     K(x(),x)    ,       
V(T_0) = d^4 x V(x)  T_0 (x)   .  
 The AdS/CFT conjecture , 
can  then   be formulated as the statement  that
 the  string generating functional as functional of 
 is equal to the corresponding gauge-theory
generating functional,
 ,
where  is a local gauge-invariant
operator with appropriate quantum numbers and dimension.It does not 
seem to be known how
 to directly compute the  string 2-point
 function in this set-up. In compact 2-d CFT case the
 result for the 2-point correlator
  is zero  due to division by the Mobius  group volume.
 In the non-compact
AdS case we are supposed to get a finite
result; this should be a consequence,  in particular, of 
the special 
 role of the boundary  terms in AdS.  
 Choosing  to be a  delta-function gives us simply
 the correlators of unintegrated
vertex operators each  localised at a  given boundary point
and having specific dependence
on radial direction  .

This (euclidean) AdS/CFT duality  prescription of the equality of the two generating
functionals , 
 was not yet   tested at the full 
 string-theory (as opposed to supergravity)  level.
One motivation to study the structure of 
string-level  vertex operators  and  of 
semiclassical approach  in the string path integral
is that  this    may help to clarify 
the   duality relation.




Operators with orbital momentum  and semiclassical approximation  


Let us now  review  the  case of the simplest 
vertex operator  carrying large  orbital momentum   
in      and the semiclassical derivation of
its dimension. 

Consider  the  dilaton-type   vertex operator
corresponding to the ground-state (supergravity) 
level state. 
According to , the 
 unintegrated operator localised at point 0  at the boundary can be
  written as 
 can be written as
(see , )

_J () _J (x(),z(),()) = 
  C   (N_+)^-   (n_x)^J   V^(2)   ,   
where 
is a scalar operator that has the same form as the sigma model 
Lagrangian
and is contributing to the  2-d dimension to make a  operator.Dots stand for the  fermionic contributions
 (-corrections are expected to be absent for a vertex operator 
representing a supergravity  state 
which is dual to a chiral primary operator, see also below). 
For the dilaton vertex operator
in flat  dimensions defined on 2-sphere one is to add also the term 
. 


In particular,   the Euclidean  space and   are  described by 
the two 6-vectors )

N_M N_M N_5^2  - N^2_- N^2_4  =1   ,         
    n_k n_k =1  .   


The linear combinations appearing in  areNote that 
   scales under the dilation  isometry of AdS 
in the same way as the boundary coordinate
 (). 
Let us also recall the relation between , 
global  coordinates (, and  angles
with metric 
) 
and the Poincare coordinates:

  (),      ,

N_- =  1 z    , 
 
and 

n_x n_1 + i n_2 = z_1 + i z_2 z  = e^i       ,    
which represents rotation in  plane in 
 or along the big circle of .

To localise  such operator at the boundary  we need to
form a linear superposition integrating over 

V_J (x)= d^2   _J(x() -x  ,z(),())
 .  
This operator will have zero world-sheet dimension  and
the right   space-time dimension
to be dual to the corresponding gauge theory operator with dimension . 



 Then   for  (cf. )

V_J()
d^2   ^(4)  (x() - x)
   ( n_z() )^J   V^(2)  ()  ,
 
i.e. we get indeed an operator localised  at one point at the boundary.
It has an arbitrary 4-momentum if we do the  Fourier transform
in , i.e.  it is  "on-shell" in 5-d but
 "off-shell" in 4-d sense. 


The correlators of  computed using  string sigma model on
the 2-sphere  should give correlators of the dual gauge theory at the
boundary, with  .
On the basis of conformal symmetry we expect

< V_J(x) V_-J  (x')>     x - x'^-   .
 
To determine    one may compute the anomalous dimension 
of  using  sigma-model perturbation theory 
in . One can show that at least in the 1-loop 
approximation (and ignoring all fermionic contributions)Contrary
to naive expectation, 
fermions may in principle contribute to 
renormalization of composite operators even in the 1-loop approximation:
the superstring action contains the RR  5-form coupling term  
  and 
the fermions in it  may be "paired" with the fermions in the 
 factors in the  vertex operator. 
the operator   is an eigen-operator of the 
anomalous dimension matrix  and so 
 the resulting marginality condition 
 takes  the form   
(see ,  and below) 

0== 2 - 2  +  1 2  [ (- J(J+4) ]  + O( 1 ()^2  )
 .  
This implies    for large . 


In the case of the 
large "classical" values of  and  in  the
 same  relation can be  obtained 
using  a semiclassical approximation
in the path integral for the 2-point function of the unintegrated 
vertex operators .
As was mentioned above in  ,, this semiclassical approach 
in general goes beyond the perturbative 1-loop result.  





Using the global AdS coordinates in the string action, 

rotating  the global AdS  time  to the Euclidean one 
(so that ) 
  and expanding near point
where  with all  angles except  in   being  trivial,
  we get for  the relevant  part of the Euclidean string  action  on
the 2-sphere

I=  4  d^2  [ ( _a t_e)^2 ( 1 + ...) 
  + (_a )^2 (1 + ...)   + ... ]
 .  
The  aim is to show that demanding  that the two-point function 
has canonical 2-d dimension 

 < _J  (_1) _-J  (_2) >
= [dt_e  d...]  e^-I[t_e,,...] 
    _J  (_1) _-J  (_2)
      _1 - _2^-4 
 
implies


that  .
The insertions of the vertex operators provide  effective source
terms to the above action:

 e^-[ t_e(_1) - t_e(_2) ]   + i J [ (_1) - (_2) ]    .    
When  and  have  large "classical"  
 values, the action and the "source" terms 
are of the same order, and the path integral is saturated by 
the stationary point  trajectory. 


 Then (as in the usual case of a gaussian integral)
 we get a complex  semiclassical trajectory  for the angle 
().  
The final semiclassical  result for the  correlator  is then 
 proportional to
 
 < _J  (_1) _-J  (_2) >   
 
_1 - _2^2- 4    ,
         = 1 2   (^2 - J^2)  .   
 Here   -4 comes  (as in  the flat space case) 
from the contribution of  .
Demanding the marginality of the vertex operators, i.e. , 
 we are thus 
led  to the relation 
 
To relate this derivation to 
the classical solution of string theory defined
 on a  2-d
 cylinder one  may take , map the point  to 
  and 
then  map the complex -plane with two punctures into the  Euclidean 
cylinder  by setting (see also section  3)   

e^w  ,           w  = _e + i  ,     
    _e = i .   
 After we  rotate back to the Minkowski signature
the semiclassical trajectory will become  the same
as the geodesic in  (i.e.  
).





Semiclassical derivation of dimension 
of  spinning string   vertex operator  in flat space 

We would like in principle 
 to apply  a similar  semiclassical argument to the case 
of  the spinning  string states.
Though this  turns out to be rather hard to achieve 
in practice in case, 
 as we will describe 
in this section  
   the  semiclassical derivation 
of the relation between energy and spin 
 works indeed in  the flat space case. 

The vertex operator  that describes  a (bosonic) 
 string state on the leading Regge trajectory 
with spin     and energy   in flat space 
 can be represented as follows 

_S() = e^ -i E t   ( X  X )^S/2  ,    
 X = x_1+ix_2,        X =x_1-ix_2  .  
For any   the  marginality  condition  implies that 

= 2 - S  - E^2 =0  ,        i.e. 
        E^2  = 2 (S-2)   .   
In flat space  the  spin factor provides only a contribution to 
canonical dimension, while the anomalous  dimension comes from the
1-loop renormalisation of the  exponential (energy) factor. 

Let us show that for large (classical) value of  
the flat  Regge trajectory relation   can be found by a 
semiclassical 
path integral argument similar to the one in the previous section.
The  aim is to compute

A_2 (_1-_2)<_S(_1) _-S (_2)> 
,            _-S  
 _S ( X X) 
   
 in the semiclassical approximation, and
to show that (cf. ) 

A_2 ()      _1 - _2^2  -4     ,        
(E, S)   ,   
where  is approximatelt the same 
as in , i.e.   
so that demanding the  2-d conformal  invariance implies the leading Regge trajectory 
relation,  .
The idea  is  again 
that in the  limit  when  both  and    are of order of  the string tension
the path integral   representation for  in 
 should be dominated  by  a (complex)
classical trajectory with the  source terms (or boundary conditions)
determined  by the vertex operator insertions.


Note that the Regge trajectory relation  may be  rewritten as 
   and thus  remains the same in the limit 
when  both  and   are 
of the order of string tension . 
Indeed, as is well known, the  same relation  is obtained  for a 
classical string solution describing  folded closed string
 rotating about its center of mass. 
One finds  from the  closed string 
equations  defined on a 2-cylinder  ()
with Minkowski signature in both target space and
world sheet

t =  ,     
 X= x_1 + i x_2 =  r()  e^ i ()   ,
     x_1 - i x_2
=  r()  e^- i ()   ,   

() = n  ,   
    r() = (n )  ,       
n   ,  
       n=1,2,...  .  
The relation between  and   follows from the
 conformal gauge constraint. 
The energy and the spin are 

E=  1 2 ^2 _0 d  t =
  ,    
   S=  i 4 ^2 _0 d 
( X - X)= n ^2 2  ,  
so that for   the leading Regge trajectory state (having 
minimal energy for a given spin) one has
 ,  i.e. a single fold of the closed string. Then  
  . 
  Another classical solution describing 
  oscillating  closed string  is formally obtained from , by
  interchanging  and  in the expression for , 
  i.e. , . In this case 
  the spin is equal to zero, while we still get 
   and .  The vertex operator 
  representing such state is  a scalar 
  operator  from level :  
. Similar solutions in AdS case were constructed in 
   .  
  
 




The explicit form of  the correlator    computed in conformal gauge 
on a  2-sphere or complex plane  is (we rotate to the Euclidean time
)In  our notation 

and 

The Green's function of the Laplacian

on the complex plane is
,
i.e.
.
Here  is the 2-d delta-function normalized  in such a way  that
, so that
,
etc.
 




 
   [ e^- E t_e  
 ( X      X  
 )^S/2  ] (_1) 
[   e^ E t_e   
 ( X      X  
 )^S/2   ](_2) 
.    
This is a gaussian integral that of course can  be   easily
computed exactly, giving    with the coefficient   in  . 





In the case of  the "classical"  values of 
  and   we may instead apply 
the semiclassical method to compute .
We start by  rewriting  the  vertex operator
 insertions in  in the exponential form as

( - E [t_e (_1) - t_e (_2)]) 
 [   S ( [ X      X  
  (_1) ]
+   [ X      X  
  (_2) ] ) ]  ,  
and then look for  a  stationary point of the total
expression in the exponent in ,
 i.e. of the sum of the classical action  with  the terms in
the , i.e.  .

While the contribution of the time coordinate is the
obvious one
(i.e. the same as in the case discussed in section 2.2),
the solution for  may seem to be  less trivial to find, 
 given a  complicated non-linear form of the
terms coming from the vertex operator
insertions.  However, one may   expect 
that  details of these insertions should not be too 
important: the 
they  should just  select the relevant  solution of the free
Laplace equation for  which effectively
 describes a classical trajectory associated with a
spin  configuration.
If the  role of the "sources"  is only 
 to specify appropriate boundary conditions
(though different from simply
-functions   appearing in the case
of the external momentum insertions like  one)
a natural guess is  that the associated stationary point
solution should be a complex analog
of the real Minkowski-time  rotating 
folded   string solution   with  spin .

Using  translational invariance  we may set 
.
Then the equations  obtained by varying ,   and  in
the effective action in ,  are

t_e
= E  [  () -  ( ,  

= S ( [ 1 X  ()]
+ [ 1 X  ()] )
 ,   

X
=S ( [ 1   (+ [ 1   ()
 .   

The relevant solution of this system  can be constructed  by 
 starting from
  the  known classical solution , on the 2-cylinder.The
  argument that follows was worked out in collaboration with S. Frolov.
  A related derivation of the marginality condition
  using  a single vertex operator insertion and 
  imposing the conformal gauge constraint 
   was given   K. Zarembo. 
We shall first
 note that the conformal transformation of the complex plane 
 defined by 

 ^-1   =   ^-1     -  _2^-1      
maps the points  and  to points   and
, respectively. Then the complex -plane with punctures 
at  and  can be mapped 
(as in the context of the standard  operator - state correspondence) 
to a Euclidean cylinder   by 
the transformation , i.e. 

= e^_e + i   ,           _e = i  .   
The classical solution 
on the Minkowski 2-cylinder  can be 
rotated  to the Euclidean solution  (
) which takes the following form in terms of  :

t_e = ^2  ,      
X= 2 i   ( - )   ,     
=2 i   (  ^-1  -  ^-1 )    .  
We have  introduced a parameter
 which is equal to  on
the classical single-fold solution  satisfying the
 conformal constraint.
Note that   and  in the Euclidean solution   
 are no longer related by a complex conjugation.
Instead, they  are related by the transformation 
 or , which, as expected,  interchanges the two
insertion points, or reverses  the time axis on the cylinder. 

Transformed to  the -plane the system ,, has the same form 
with  and .
  Then ,  and   in  solve the free
Laplace equation  on
the -plane apart from the points  and .
 At these special points they are indeed
supported by the  source terms in the right hand side of ,, 
provided    and  in   are  related to the  "source" 
coefficients  and   in  ,,  by 



 E=   ,            ^2 = 2 S      .  
These are the same  relations as the ones    for the 
classical solution , but here obtained in a very  different way. 



The solution of the original system ,,
is then given by ,   with  replaced by  according to
 .
The final step is  to evaluate the effective  action in the path integral , 
on this Euclidean solution,  i.e. find the coefficient 
   in    and thus  determine  
from the conformal invariance condition  .
Following the discussion in  section  2, the time coordinate  contribution 
 is given, as in the standard gaussian integral,  by the 
1/2 of the external point  contribution. 
One finds 
that the   part of the classical string action
vanishes on the solution 
so
that  the  semiclassical contribution
 to the  path integral comes only from the -dependent 
vertex operator insertion terms in  evaluated on the solution.
The latter is essentially
 determined  by the
canonical  dimension of the vertex operators.As always 
for  string excited states in flat space, the mass shell 
condition expresses the 
 balance between  the anomalous dimension of the 
operator and canonical dimension of the pre-exponential
 factors. The spin  term in  represents 
   the canonical dimension. 
Differentiating ,  in  or 
over  in ,
 we get  (regularising and omiting some  obvious singular terms)
the factor , which,
combined with the -contribution,  then  reproduces
 with , i.e. 
gives  the leading Regge trajectory  relation. 


To summarize:

(i)  The role of matching onto the  source terms
 in the classical
equations is to relate the parameters  of the semiclassical
trajectory  to the quantum numbers  of the vertex operators.
In the
classical rotating string solution  this   was done 
 by
fixing the values  of the conserved quantities on the solution.

(ii) 
The  role of the  marginality condition 
is to relate  to . In the classical solution 
this  followed  from the  conformal
 constraint that related  the parameter   determining  the energy 
and  the parameter   determining  the spin .



Vertex operators for spinning string states in  
 and   


One would like to try to  give a similar semiclassical 
path integral derivation 
of dimensions of  string states  with large  
 spin  in  or intrinsic 
angular momentum  
in  with 

  for which the classical 
solutions of   predict that 

(S)_S  1  = S + 1    S + ...  ,       
  (J)_J  1  = J +  2    + ...     .   
The first step  should be to identify the corresponding 
vertex operators  
that should be analogs  of the operator 
with orbital momentum .
One could then attempt to 
 compute the 2-point functions like ,  
in semiclassical approximation   to determine  the anomalous power 
 or ,  
 which, when set to zero, should be reproducing hopefully 
  the results . 
  
  Here we  will not be able to complete the second part of this program
  (though we will make some comments on it in section 4.2), 
  and  will most  concentrate (in sections 4.1 and 5)
   on the first part, i.e.
   determining the 
  structure of vertex operators,    which 
  already turns out to be quite non-trivial. 
  
  
General structure of vertex operators 


The natural  conditions on  such  vertex  operators 
are: (i) they should carry the required  quantum numbers  and  or ,
i.e. should have appropriate transformation properties under  
and ;
(ii) in the flat-space limit they should reduce to the 
leading Regge trajectory  vertex  operator  . The latter condition 
implies that their level number or  canonical 2-d  dimension 
(equal to the number of 2-d derivatives)  should be 
 (or ).As above, we shall be 
 ignoring 
terms depending on the fermionic string coordinates 
(as well as possible -corrections). A possible excuse is 
that one  expects that  they should not be important in  
the leading semiclassical 
approximation (fermions were  of course  set to zero 
in the classical solutions of ). 

An  obvious candidate  for a  vertex operator representing a string state
with angular momentum  in   is then (cf. ,)In 
flat space limit 
, etc., with  playing the
role of a radial coordinate. 

_J() = c (N_+)^- ( n_x   n_x )^J/2  , 
             n_x n_1 + i n_2   .   
The  analogous  operator   for a spinning string  in   is 

_S() = c (N_+)^- ( N_x   N_x )^S/2  , 
             N_x N_1 + i N_2   .   
It may be useful to record also the 
explicit form of  in terms of independent  coordinates  on .
The Euclidean   sigma model Lagrangian 


 can be written as 

 L=  T T
+ N_ N_+
( T  + T T) N_N_ ,    
        T N_+  ,   
or as 






=    (1+N_x N_x )   (N_x ) 
(N_x )4(1+N_x )  +N_x   + ... ,     
where   dots stand for the  terms depending on
the remaining coordinates
 .
Here  
is  the  global "Euclidean  AdS time"
variableNote that this   is not the same as 
Euclidean rotation of 
 used in  a footnote below : the  Euclidean
global coordinates
 here are  related to the direct Euclidean analog of the coordinates 
there by a global  transformation which   
effectively interchanges
 and  (so that now ,
).
 The relation to the Poincare coordinates is  however  is
the same.  

N_+ - 12 (1+N_N_)=
T- 12 (1+ N_N_)  ,        
e^2  =  N_+ N_-       .  
In these coordinates     becomes 

_S ()  =  c e^-  T   ( N_x N_x)^S/2  
=  c e^ -   (1 + N_N_)^-/2   
 ( N_x N_x)^S/2     .   
Written  in terms of the Poincare coordinates 
this vertex operator takes the form (cf. ) 

_S()  = c  (  z^2 + x_x_z )^- 
[ (Xz )   (  X z )
 ]^S/2  ,         X= x_1 + i x_2    . 
  
While  the vertex operators  and   appear to be natural choices, 
there remains a  question then if  they are indeed the correct ones 
at the quantum  string level, in particular, whether  they  
mix with other similar operators.  That would mean that they   
represent  eigen-operators of the anomalous dimension 
matrix, or,   equivalently,  that the associated 
wave functions solve the corresponding  (-corrected)
 KG equation.


It turns out that, in contrast to what was in the case of 
the spinning state operator  in flat space, 
 the operators  and  
do mix with other similar operators   already in the 1-loop 
) approximation for the sigma model.
At the same time, the operator  representing a 
point-like string state with an  orbital momentum  
is indeed an eigen-operator of the anomalous dimension matrix. 

As we shall explain  in  section 5, for any value of  
the operator  of 
(bosonic) sigma model on a sphere   mixes under 
the 1-loop renormalization 
with the following operators 
 (all of which have the same canonical dimension 
equal to the angular momentum  )
  (n_x)^2p + 2q    (n_x)^J/2 - 2p    (n_x)^J/2 - 2q  
( n_m n_m)^p ( n_k n_k)^q   ,     
p,q= 0,..., J/4   ,   
where there are sums  over the indices  and 
with range  (in the 5-d  case of our interest 
).  
A similar but somewhat more complicated mixing  takes place 
for the spin  operator  in the bosonic  sigma model -
the operator   may mix with 

 N_+^- - p-q  N_x^p+q  (N_+)^p (N_x)^S/2-p  
(N_+)^q (N_x)^S/2-q  + ...    ,  
          p,q= 0,..., S/4   ,  
where  dots  stand for terms 
involving powers of  scalar operators
  and  
similar to the ones in . 
Again,  these operators have the same  quantum 
numbers  as .Note  that we do not include 
extra real factors 
like  or  .
Their maximal power  plays the role of an additional 
quantum number, and their (1-loop) 
renormalization  always decreases . 

This obviously raises the question of whether this mixing is
important  to take into account in an attempt of a semiclassical 
derivation of the corresponding anomalous dimensions  for large values 
of quantum numbers.
The  linear combinations  of the above operators 
that represent the true spinning string  vertex operators 
 may simplify in the limit of large quantum numbers.



We are unable to answer this question
here,  and in the next subsection  will  only 
sketch a  strategy of   possible
semiclassical argument in the  rotation case 
starting simply with the "naive" form of the corresponding 
vertex  operator .
The  rotation case is more transparent than the 
spinning  case
but is already quite non-trivial to illustrate the main 
points.



Towards a semiclassical  derivation 
of anomalous dimension of 
vertex operator with   angular momentum  


In the semiclassical approximation 
the  and  factors  and 
 in   can be treated independently.
As in the   orbital momentum case of section 2.2 
the  factor contributes to the 2-point correlator 
 the same term  as in  
with . 
For  the stationary point 
is as in , i.e. 

t_e =  12  ^2    ,          =    ,   
where  is given by . 
 The main complication lies in the  sector. 
 Since the vertex operator depends only on  components of 
 6-vector, we may assume that     and consider the 
  subspace of   parametrized by 
  and . 
 Then the relevant part of the  string   action 
 will  be the  sigma model  (cf. ) 
  
 I  =    d^2  
 [  n_x +  ( n_x )  (n_x)
  4 ( 1- n_x )  ]  .   
Adding to this action the (minus) logarithm of 
the product of the two  operators  and  
 at points  and , 
i.e. 
 - J [ (n_x n_x)(0) ()(_2 
 )]     
 and assuming 
 that the angular momentum  is of order of 
 the string tension , 
 we can then try to find   a (complex) 
 semiclassical trajectory  
 that  saturates this path integral in the semiclassical 
 approximation. This would then 
 determine the -factor contribution  
  to  in the analog of .
 
 
 In view of the discussion of the flat space case in section 3
 it is natural to anticipate that the stationary point solution will
 be
 related by an analytic continuation and 
 the "cylinder  complex plane"  map 
 to the classical solution in  describing folded closed string
 rotating  at the north pole of . 
 In Minkowski notation this solution has 
 the following form on the 2-d
 cylinder (here the metric of   taken to be 

)



  = ,            
+  ^2  =0   .  
We should not impose the conformal  gauge constraint 
that in  related  to  in  
and thus  to :
here this relation should 
 follow from the marginality condition of the
vertex operators, 
i.e. from the vanishing of the coefficient  in the 2-point
correlator .
Using the parametrization
 
n_x =  e^i   ,             
=  e^-i   ,  
rotating the solution to the  euclidean one, , 
and mapping the cylinder onto the complex plane according to 
,   we end up with the following complex solution 
for the independent functions  and  on the
-plane:Note
that  under  
in agreement with the  exchange symmetry of the two vertex operators
or time reversal on the cylinder. 

n_x =  f( ) ^   ,            
=  f( ) ^-   ,    
where  satisfies the equation (the transformed form 
of   the equation for  in )  

(1-f^2) f"  + f f'^2  +  ^2 f (1-f^2)^2 =0  ,  




Eqs. , represent 
a particular   vacuum solution of the  sigma model .
 The solution  in the case of the 
spinning string state in  (i.e. the one that should be relevant
for the semiclassical computation of the 2-point function of the
operators ) has a similar structure:
,     
, 
where  , with 
. 
The  next and main  
 issue is then to show that matching it onto the source 
terms  coming from  
we get the required relation between the angular momentum 
and 
the parameter  of the solution.For this it is sufficient 
to consider just a single vertex operator insertion.  
 The explicit  form of this  relation 
is in general quite complicated   
but it should at least simplify  in the limit of large .
 Unfortunately, the non-linear form of the equation 
 makes matching onto -function siurce terms 
 (cf. ,)  hard to  implement explicitly.
To relate  to  in the limit  
 it  may be sufficient to  use only  an 
asymptotic form of the solution , with introduction of 
a 2-d cutoff near  or . 

As in section 3, the final step will be to evaluate the sigma model
action (plus source terms) on the solution 
to find the -dependent contribution to the coefficient  in 
the analog of , and then hopefully reproduce 
 in  from the conformal invariance 
 requirement that . 

One may object the utility of this method, given that  it seems 
to be  much more complicated and  indirect as 
  compared to the original  
 ("semiclassical string states on a cylinder") 
 approach of .In particular, it seems unlikely that one 
 will be able to derive  the full relation  in 
 for any value of  in the present vertex operator 
 approach. 
 
 
 Still, we hope that 
 further understanding of this method may shed more light on
 details of the  "string state - vertex operator"  correspondence 
 in the nonlinear sigma model cases  like the present one. 
 


Renormalization of composite operators  in 
 and   sigma model  


Let us now return to the issue of the mixing 
of the rotation vertex operators, i.e.   mixing 
 with  and   with .

Having  in mind applications to  the 
  string theory,  one may expect that in the  1-loop 
approximation one may ignore the fermions  and thus, in particular, 
treat  renormalizations in the   and  sectors  
as independent. However, as already mentioned above, 
this is not  a priori obvious. Indeed, 
the superstring action  contains the R-R 5-form coupling term  
which has    structure  .
String vertex operators  may also contain fermionic terms
like   and 
.  Pairing the fermionic terms in the action
 and in the vertex operators one may thus get 
 additional fermionic contributions to 
 the renormalization of the vertex operators. 
One   may also get, via such fermionic contributions, extra  mixings between 
the operator factors  from the  and from the .
Here we shall not attempt to take 
such fermionic contributions into the account, 
 hoping  that 
they would  not qualitatively change our main conclusions.  


Extending  the discussion in , in this section  we shall study 
 mixing and anomalous dimensions  for  vertex-type  
 operators in the  invariant  2-d sigma model, 
applying  the   general method   described in   (see also ). 
As in   , we  will  
 consider explicitly only the 1-loop approximation in bosonic 
sigma model, but  we expect  that  these  1-loop results may 
 clarify  some important  features  of the general  case. 
The  discussion  of the   sigma model case can be 
generalized   also to  the  case 
using a simple continuation rule as in . 














Let us start with some general remarks. 
Given a sigma modelIn general, the sigma model 
should be defined on a curved 2-d background; one 
should include all possible 
couplings to the curvature of the 2-d metric and 
instead of usual scale invariance 
demand the vanishing of the Weyl anomaly 
coefficients. 
In addition to Klein-Gordon-type equation for the tensor 
function,  that leads, as in flat space , 
 also to divergence-free and tracelessness
conditions  (see, e.g.,  and refs. there).  
with the action 
  one may perturb it by an arbitrary 
higher-dimensional local operator of  the type 
(with total number of 2-d derivatives or level number )

and compute the renormalization of the coupling  tensor 
. Demanding the vanishing of the 
corresponding 
beta-function to linear  order in 
(but to all orders in ) 
determines the corresponding 
 marginal string vertex operator . 
 The resulting equation  has symbolic form 
 
,
 where  is the "anomalous dimension" operator
 (in which we included also the canonical dimension term).
 For example, a  2-nd rank tensor  (massive spin 2) 
 satisfies a Lichnerowicz-type  equation .
  Solving such  equations  for   is equivalent to finding the
  the eigenvalues and eigen-vectors 
  of the anomalous dimension operator. 
  Unfortunately, the general form of  operator 
  for generic tensor  and metric   is not known  even 
  to the leading (1-loop) order in .
  For this reason,  in most cases
  (with possible exceptions being WZW models or 
  some plane-wave type models) 
   one is not able to  use a universal expression for  
   and needs to  calculate 
  the anomalous dimensions of specific higher-derivative 
    operators  starting from  "first principles". 
   
    
  
  When the sigma model metric   has a  large
   global symmetry
  (e.g., corresponds to a symmetric space)
  it is natural to construct the operator   so that it is 
  covariant under the  global symmetry. In particular, instead 
  of using  local coordinates ,  we may  write  in terms 
   some   global coordinates on which the group acts linearly. 
  This is what we will do   in the discussion below. 
 
 
 

Rules of 1-loop renormalization in    sigma model  



To set up the notation, let us   start with the action of the     action
defined on a complex plane

S =  R^2 4  d^2  ( _a n_m)^2 
=     d^2   n_m n_m    ,      
n_m n_m =1   ,   
where   and  
 
plays the role of the standard  dimensionless coupling constant, 
which runs according to the   well-known RG equationThe full 
 string is of course conformally invariant 
due to additional  fermionic contributions 
to beta-functions of each of the  and  coupling constants 
 
coming from the R-R 5-form coupling term.
 
   

= - 
+ (^2  +  (^3  + ...  ,      
         1    ,      
    = d-2   .    
In view of the   discussion in the previous section 
 we shall be interested in renormalization of the 
following class of  covariant 
operatorsSince eventually 
we will be interested in operators corresponding to 
states on leading  Regge trajectory we 
do not include terms with multiple derivatives.  
 
O_,s  =  f_k_1...k_  m_1...m_2s    
n_k_1  ...  n_k_   n_m_1  n_m_2  ...
n_m_2s-1   n_m_2s  
  .   


These form  a special  class of composite 
operators considered in  (see sects.  8,9 there). 
We shall  assume that  is even and thus we can split  
the components of  into complex  pairs, i.e.

n_x = n_1 + i n_2  ,     = n_1 - i n_2  ,         
n_y = n_3 + i n_4  ,   ... .    
In the  case of  Euclidean   
 the corresponding  split 
of  the   unit vector 
  is into , where   are real, 
i.e. . 

To compute the  1-loop renormalisation of the operators  one may 
follow the general method of   and use 
 the following results for "pairing" of 
different building blocks of 
composite  operatorsWe keep only the singular term 
proportional to  and use the notation of 
:  ,  where 
   and  are some operators; if they depend on  only 
then 
, etc.
Also,   
.
These pairing rules can be understood also in the 
framework of the   background field method .
Note  that in the process of renormalization 
one is   allowed  to ignore redundant operators proportional to 
equations of motion, e.g., 

, 
where   is any local operator.   

<n_k >  = - (I n_k  ,    
< n_k , n_l> = - I( n_k n_l  - _kl )  , 
          I= -  1 2     , 
 
 
<n_k, n_l> = - I n_k n_l  ,   
 <n_k, n_l> = - I n_k n_l  ,     
   
 <n_k, n_l> =  I n_k n_l n_m n_m  ,        
 <n_k, n_l> =  I n_k n_l n_m n_m  ,   
  <n_k ,n_l> = - I (n_k n_l -_kl   n_m n_m )
 .   
Contracting indices  in     we get
. Then 
 using  we conclude that 
   <(n_k n_k)> = <n_k> n_k  + n_k <n_k> +  
<n_k ,n_k>  =  0     .  
For other scalar contractions one finds  

 <(n_k n_k)> = - (I  n_k n_k ,          
 <(n_k n_k)> =  - (I  n_k n_k ,    
 

 <(n_k n_k) ,  (n_m n_m) > = 
2 I [ (n_k n_k) (n_m n_m) - 
(n_k n_k) (n_m n_m)]  ,    
  <(n_k n_k) ,  (_a n_m _b n_m) > = 0  ,    
 <(n_k n_k) ,  (_a n_m _b n_m) > = 0  ,    

< n_l ,  (_a n_k _b  n_k)> =0   ,     
<n_l ,  (n_k n_k)> =0   ,    
<n_l ,  (n_k n_k)> =0   ,    

<n_l ,  (n_k n_k)> =
I [ n_l   (n_k n_k) - n_l  (n_k n_k) ] 
  .    
Here ,   and similar relations 
are valid for complex conjugate combinations. 
Some of the above relations simplify 
when written in terms of the complex combinations  in   (note that )

< n_x , n_x> = - I n_x n_x  ,       
 <n_x ,n_x> = - I n_x n_x     ,        
 <(n_x n_x)> = -  I  n_x n_x     ,
 

 



Anomalous dimensions of some  simple operators  


We are now ready to discuss some  examples of 
operators . 
 The simplest "lowest level"  scalar  operator 
  with 
traceless  is transformed under renormalization into
itself (see ).  It has the same anomalous dimension   as its 
simplest (highest-weight) 
representative:If  is the coupling 
constant that multiplies a composite  operator when it is added to the 
action, the anomalous dimension is defined by 
.  

A_= (n_x)^  :
       
 - [ (+  (] + O(^2) 
= -    (+ + O(^2)   . 
  
The two  terms came from the two terms in  
(note that for  the number of 
2-point pairings is ). 
The total  coefficient  
  is of course 
the value of the corresponding quadratic
 Casimir (this is a particular spherical harmonic, i.e.
 it solves the  Laplace 
equation on the sphere). 

As follows from , the Lagrangian
operator   has zero dimension.
 Also, eq.  implies that it does 
not mix with  powers of , i.e. 
the dimension of  is given simply 
by the sum of the corresponding dimensions, 
.

Similar results for operators of  are found 
by replacing  and  by 
  and , taking   and 
changing  the sign  of the coupling , i.e. of the 
coupling.Note that the term 
 (with signature ) enters 
the action with the opposite sign 
compared to the term  ; this   reflects
 the opposite signs of the curvatures of  and . 
That implies that the dimension of 
   is 
.
Applying these remarks to the case of the "dilaton" operator 
 we verify the expression  for its perturbative anomalous 
dimension ( for the sphere factor and ). 

Note that according to  
.
Thus the left-right  factorized 
operators  
 do not mix with  operators containing  factors.
In particular, 
the number of  factors never increases, so 
it can be used  as a quantum number 
to characterise the leading term in the corresponding 
 operator . An example of such 
an operator  considered  in 
,,  is 
 (n_k n_k)^r+ ...   :         2-2r  +    r(r-1) 
+ 
[ 2 3  r (r-1) (r- 7 2 )  + r (] ^2 +
O(^3)  .     
Here  the 2-loop correction was computed in .
Dots following the operator  
stand for other operators it mixes with, and  is the 
corresponding diagonal element of the anomalous dimension matrix. 
Here (as in )  one is to account  for 
the number of 2-point pairings  , but  
 there is extra -2 in  as compared to . The dimension indeed vanishes for  in agreement with the above discussion of the dilaton operator.  
In more detail, the above pairing rules imply that a 
renormalization-invariant  linear combination of the operators 
of the same canonical dimension  
 is given by   (we assume that  is even integer)When  is odd one is to consider 


. 
  O_r= _p=0 ^r/2  c_p  
 (n_k n_k)^r-2p    (n_m n_m)^p (n_l n_l)^p  .      
The 1-loop  renormalization 
matrix  has
 only the diagonal and  the next  off-diagonal 
line of entries, with the diagonal ones being proportional to  

 a_1+p, 1+p  = (r-2 p) (r-1-2p) - 2 (p  ,          
p=0, 1,2 , ...,  r/2   .  
The diagonal values are thus the eigenvalues, with largest one
for large   
 being  (corresponding to  ).  
 The associated eigen-operator   has all terms in the linear combination being present (i.e. all  are non-vanishing). At the same time, 
the "last" operator is an eigen-operator by itself, 


(n_k n_k n_m n_m)^r/2     :        
     2-2r  -    r (+  O(^2)  .  
Since   does mix with the scalar operators like
  or  (cf. ), 
it can be directly combined with them; using , we get 
 
n^_x [ (n_k n_k)^r+ ...]   :       
 2-2r  - [(+ -  2 r(r-1) ]+ 
O(^2)  .  
One finds  that due to the opposite signs of the two contributions
 the total  1-loop correction  to the anomalous dimension 
can be made small   for large  by choosing .
The analogous observation can be made  
 for the corresponding   operator
  
N^- _+ [ (N_M N_M)^r+ ...]   :       
 2-2r  + [(- +2)  -  2 r(r-1)] + 
O(^2)  .   
Provided a similar pattern persists at  higher loop orders
(i.e. the 2-loop correction is proportional to  at 
large  and , cf. ,)  
one may  conjecture   that the 
dimension  of  the corresponding 
high-level string vertex  operators should not blow up in 
the limit .  
In the string  context such  operator may  represent  
a  particular high-level scalar string mode with no  
extra global charges like spin or  angular momentum.Such 
operators  may be dual to singlet  scalar SYM 
operators  of high dimension  like the ones considered in . 

The 1-loop correction in   has 
a very  similar  structure to the one of   the dimension of the 
"dilaton" operator with   orbital momentum   
 in . As we shall see below, an analogous 
 structure of the 1-loop anomalous dimension  is characteristic also  
 to the  vertex operators , 
  representing spinning string states  on leading Regge trajectory. 
 


Operators with angular momentum in   


We would like now to discuss renormalization 
 of the operator ,
which is expected to be  a part of the   vertex operator 
representing string state with angular momentum  in the 5-sphere . 
  It is clear  from the above rules , etc., 
that this operator may  mix with  
and , but not with .
On symmetry grounds,  the general  operator of the same  angular momentum  
 and dimension    (not containing   factors and higher 
derivatives) which is stable under the renormalization  
 is given by a  linear combination
of the following operators  
(we shall assume that   is  even):

O_s 
= ^s/2 _ p,q =0   c_pq   M_pq   ,     
M_pq  = V_pq + V_qp    ,           s= J/2   ,    

V_pq =
 (n_x)^2p+2q   ( n_x)^s-2p  (n_x)^s-2q 
(n_m n_m )^p  (n_k n_k )^q  
  .  
We  have symmetrised the operators  over  
 
 so that there is the invariance  under 
 (or "2-d reality" property). 
The left and right sectors in   look 
completely independent so 
can be analysed separately.This would no longer be true for  
the operators with the same angular momentum and dimension
but containing extra factors of  .
In the flat space limit, such operators would  represent 
states on a subleading Regge trajectory. 


The analysis of renormalisation  of this operator  is similar to the
 case of .
We find that under the 1-loop 
renormalization  the operators   transform as follows
(here there is no summation under ) 

V_pq  V_pq  + I ( a_pq   V_pq    +  f_p  V_p+1,q   +  f_q  V_p,q+1  )   ,   
where 


 
= 2 p^2 + 2 q^2 - (p+q) ( 2s + -  s (s+  ,  

f_p  = (s-2p) (s-2p-1)   ,            f_q  = (s-2q) (s-2q-1)   .  
Here the first  term came from the  in 
  and the last  one  - from 
. The "2-d real" combination 
  transforms into 
a "2-d real" combination:

M_pq  M_pq  + I ( a_pq   M_pq    +  f_p  M_p+1,q   
+  f_q  M_p,q+1 )     .   
The anomalous dimension matrix is then  upper-triangular, and so 
 its eigenvalues are  equal to the diagonal entries .

The  minimal value of  is at , 
i.e.
a_00  = - s( s+  ,       
 while  the maximal value is
 formally reached at  the extremum of the quadratic polynomial , 
, i.e. at  in the present case, 

a_s2 , s2    =  -2s ( s + -2)   .   
The associated  eigen-operators 
are particular linear combinations .
The eigen-operator  for the the eigenvalue   
starts   with the term  in  which has the  coefficient .
In particular,  the operator  is 
present only in the combination corresponding to the minimal 
eigenvalue , i.e. in this case the eigen-operator 
contains all terms in  
 O_s = c_00  (n_x n_x)^s + ... 
  + c_s2 , s2  
  (n_x)^2s  (n_k n_k n_m n_m)^s/2    .    
Remarkably, in  contrast to what happens in flat space, 
in  (or ) space an   operator 
with a factor   representing a string state 
with an  "intrinsic" angular momentum   
may mix  with  an operator with a  factor 
 which  may be interpreted as  representing   a state with 
"orbital"   component  of the angular momentum. 
At the same time, the "last" operator in the sum   or  
does not mix with others -
it is by itself  the eigen-operator  for  the eigenvalue . 


To construct a string vertex operator of canonical dimension  
 corresponding to a string state with angular momentum   
in  and energy  in  we need  to multiply the above 
operators by . This way we get  for the  case
 
()
   N_+^-  [ ( n_x   n_x)^J/2  + ...  ]   :   

(, J)  = 2- J     +  
 1 2 l[   (-  J  (J + 10 )  ] 
+  O(  1 (l)^2 )   ,      
and for the case  

 N_+^-  n_x^J ( n_k n_k  n_m n_m)^J/4     : 
  

(, J)  = 2-J    +  
 1 2 l[   (-  J (J + 8)  ] 
+  O(  1 (l)^2 )  .       
Note that the coefficient  in    
is the sum of the 1-loop contribution
  of  in ,
and  of the operator  with .In general,
the anomalous dimensions of particular operators 
should  be related to eigenvalues of generalized massive  Laplace
equation on a sphere. In particular, 
1-loop dimensions in , should correspond to 
special  symmetric tensor harmonics  on 
 (cf. ). 


The 1-loop correction  in   has
 the same  structure as in 
 the dimension  of  the operator  
from the  "massless"  level  carrying orbital  momentum , 
i.e. 
 

.
At the same time,  has the same form as the dimension
 of the scalar  operator 
in ,  which for the same level number   
as in , and  
is given by  



All of these operators share with  the property  
that the 1-loop anomalous dimension can be made small 
by balancing the -contribution against the -contribution.
Thus imposing  marginality 
for large 
"classical" values of   and   one finds that  
 for ,  and 

 1 2  J + ...  
 for ,  
(assuming  that  higher order
 corrections do not spoil this conclusion, 
cf. ,). 


Expecting   that the operator in  
should be representing 
a folded rotating string state in  it may seem strange to find
the proportionality coefficient
in  to be   instead of 1, as 
implied  by the corresponding classical solution in .
There may be several  possible explanations for this discrepancy. 
First, it may be that higher-order corrections in 
(that are  important for "classical" values of 
 and ) first need to be summed up as in   
and only  then one finds  in the limit 
. 
Another possibility is  that additional
fermionic contributions that we ignored  above change the coefficient 
 in front of  term  into  1, and thus 
change  in  into 1. Then assuming that 
all higher order corrections  will also have the form 
, we would then get the agreement with the semiclassical
prediction  in .Finding subleading
correction in  in  would in any case 
 require 
summing contributions from all orders in 
expansion.  


Finally, it could be that  in spite of the fact that 
the operator   has the required  angular momentum and 
flat-space limit it is not the right vertex operator 
to be associated  with the semiclassical rotating string state
in .  
An indication of  which vertex operator 
is an adequate one could  come from the discussion in section 4.2
of an  attempt  to reproduce 
the relation between  and  using 
semiclassical path integral approach. 
For string rotating around north pole of  one has :

,  
and  
.
For example, while   the operator in  has  the 
 factor  that would
provide a natural  source for the angle  (cf. 
the discussion in section 2.2), the derivative part  of it 
is completely  invariant (i.e. does not 
select a particular rotation plane) and thus it is unlikely to provide 
the required source for the angle . 


To attempt to  carry out   the semiclassical argument 
sketched in  section 4.2
 we would need to decide
on specific form of the  operator in ,. 
In particular, one could try  to use just the leading term in it
given  explicitly in .  One could try to justify this provided 
the coefficients in the linear combination  were small in 
the limit of large . However, this is not the case according
to ,: the mixing is not suppressed in the large  limit.
Indeed, fixing the coefficient of the first term in  to be 1, 
the coefficients of other terms  are proportional 
to products of off-diagonal values divided over products 
of differences 
 
 










Operators with spin  in   

The analog of the operator   that carries spin in
  would be the one in . Computing its dimension in 
a naive way, i.e. ignoring its mixing with other operators 
we would get 
   N_+^-  [ ( N_x   N_x)^S/2  + ...  ]
  :   

_0  (, J)     =  2- S     +  
 1 2 l[   (+  S  (S + 10 )  ] 
+  O(  1 (l)^2 )   ,      
where we used that in the AdS case one is to reverse 
the sign of coupling compared to . 
In contrast to , here both contributions to the 1-loop 
anomalous dimension term have the  same sign and thus 
can not  cancel each other. At  small  and large  
we would still get from  the usual  linear Regge
trajectory relation, .
To interpolate to the expected large  behaviour 
it may seem that  we   need first to sum up all higher-loop
contributions to . 

However, as  already mentioned above, the operator  
mixes with other operators  under the
renormalization, and so  one should  first 
 diagonalize the corresponding 
matrix of anomalous dimensions. 

Instead of  addressing the question of renormalisation of
operators  directly 
in the  context, 
it is useful to follow the same notation as in the previous 
subsection and 
 solve  the equivalent problem in the   
sigma model.
 Namely, we shall consider the renormalization of
the    operators  of the type 

n_y^( n_x   n_x)^s  + ...  ,        
n_x= n_1 + i n_2 ,   n_y= n_3 + i n_4  ,     
which are the  direct analogs of . 
The relevant  case will be obtained by setting

,       = - ,          
s=S/2  ,        - 1  .  
There will be two different types of mixings: 
(i) in view of , i.e. , 
we will need to include operators with  factors  with no
derivatives 
and with  factors where  derivatives act on ;
(ii)  pairings of 
 with  or
, etc., will generate as in  terms with extra 
scalar factors  and .
As a result, a generic   operator which has
 the same quantum numbers
and canonical dimension  as  and which is an 
eigen-vector   of the
corresponding  anomalous dimension matrix will have 
the form (we shall assume that ) 

O_,s  = 
_u,v=0 ^s _p=0 ^ s-u 2  
 _q=0 ^ s-v2  c_uv pq   M_uvpq     ,  
  
M_uvpq  
 n_y^n_x^u+v  (n_y)^u (n_x)^s-u-2p  
(n_y)^v (n_x)^s-v -2q   
(n_k n_k)^p (n_m n_m)^q       . 
 The "last" term in this sum is  the
 direct analog of 
 and is an eigen-operator by itself:  

 n_y^  n_x^2s  ( n_k n_k  n_m n_m)^s/2   
  : 
  

(,s)  = 2-2s    - 
 1 2   [ (+ 2s)^2  + (+ 4s) (] 
+  O( ^2)  .       
To compute the  dimension  we noted 
that according to  
 pairings  in  give the contribution 

. 
Adding the  contribution of  and
of the scalar operator    we  end up with .
Note that for the corresponding  operator 
one is to use , 

 and so for large  and  
the leading term in the 1-loop correction 
vanishes  if . 





To simplify the discussion let us now ignore all  mixings
with the scalar operators 
. They
 can be readily included as in 
 section  5.3 and that leads only to upper off-diagonal terms in
 the  anomalous dimension matrix, i.e. should  not 
 change the
 eigenvalues of the anomalous dimension matrix. 
 The  term in   is 
 
O_,s  =

 Using the rules of section 5.1 we conclude that under the 1-loop

  and the diagonal renormalization coefficients are



 
=   - [   (++ 2  s (s+

A naive guess is that for  large 

 the "upper off-diagonal"
term 
  in  will be dominating over the other off-diagonal 
  terms, and then the eigenvalues of anomalous 
  dimension matrix  will be  given by  the diagonal values
  .
  For    becomes 
  a_00  = 
 - (+-   s (s+  ,  
 which  is related to the 1-loop coefficient in 
   in  the special case .
  For 
     we get  

a_ss =  - (+-  s (s+ - 2s+ 4 s^2     ,   
so that  for . 

 
 It is possible to find the eigenvalues of the 
 anomalous dimension  matrix in  following the  method 
 described in section  9 of .I am grateful to F. Wegner 
 for an important clarification  of this method. 
 In general, the eigen-operators can be  characterised by  three
 Young tableaux:  and  that describe 
 linear combinations  of permutations of the  derivatives 
  and  derivatives  in , respectively, 
 as well as by  that describes permutations of  
 factors  and . Then the  coefficients 
 in  eigenvalues of the anomalous dimension matrix 
  normalised as in 
  are given by 
 
 a= - ( + 2s) ( + a_exchange   ,  
 where the first term comes from the renormalization  (cf. ) 
   of the    and  factors and 
 
  a_exchange  = (Y_) + (Y_  ) - (Y_n)  . 
  Here  is an eigenvalue of the sum of transpositions 
  
  (Y) = _i=1,2,...     k_i ( k_i - 2i + 1)  ,      
  Y= (k_1,k_2,...)  ,   
  where  are the  numbers of boxes in  the 
   rows of  a Young tableau . 
  Since  contains only first powers of derivatives, 
  we get 
  
  Y_= (s,0,0,...)  ,        Y_ = (s,0,0,...)
    ,    
	  (Y_) = (Y_ ) = s (s-1)   . 
Given that we have only  two types of -components,
 i.e.  and , 
 will have only two rows at most
 (we assume that ) 

Y^(k) _n= (+2s- k, k, 0, 0,...)  ,      k=0,1,...,2s  ,   	  

  (Y^(k) _n) = ( +2s -k)  ( +2s -k - 1 )
  + k   ( k - 3 )  .   
  Thus the eigenvalue coefficients   are given by 
  
 a^(k) 
 = - ( + 2s) ( +  s (s-1)    
 -   ( +2s -k)  ( +2s -k - 1 )
 - k   ( k - 3 )   ,         k=0,1,...,2s  .  
   
   has a minimum at  and a maximum at  
  with values  (cf. ,) 
  
 a^(0) 
 = - ( + )  -  s ( s + )  
  -  2 s   ,     
  
 a^(2s) 
 =      -   ( + - 2)  - s ( s + - 3 )   .   
  Written in  notation   these expressions 
  become  (cf. ) 
   
 a^(0) 
 = - [  ( - 4)  + S ( S + 10  )  - 2  S  ]  ,     
  
 a^(2s) 
 =   -   [  ( -4)  + S ( S + 6 ) ]   .   
 Interestingly, in contrast to the naive dimension 
 where the 1-loop term was positive for large  and ,
 here  
  can  be made to vanish.
 The corresponding  anomalous dimension 
 
(, J)     =  2- S     +  
 1 2 l[   (+  S  (S + 10 )  - 2 S 
  ] 
+  O(  1 (l)^2 )      
 can thus   be made small for large  and   provided 
 () 
  
 (S)_S  1   
 ( 1  1 2  ) S  + 2  + O(1)    .  
 As a result,  for large  
 one is able to construct a marginal vertex operator 
 with the  required quantum numbers.
 This is,  at least 
 qualitatively,  consistent with 
 the semiclassical prediction . 
 To reproduce the same  proportionality 
 coefficient (i.e. 1) between  and   as in 
 one probably needs to sum up all relevant higher-order 
  corrections in  
 (cf. ).
 
Our main conclusion is that, as in the  rotation case 
in section 5.3,  the vertex operators  that correspond to 
string states with  spin  in   are given by linear
combinations of local operators like . 
That seems to complicate possible 

rederivation of the  semiclassical prediction  
for  from 
the  string path integral expression 
for the 2-point correlator of the two 
vertex operators.

A 
     Some basic relations

(ds^2)__AdS_5 S^5  = R^2 z^2  (dx_dx_+
dz_p dz_p  )  ,    
    z^2 = z_p z_p
 .  
In what  follows we shall often set .



In  global coordinates

ds^2__AdS_5  
= - ^2  dt^2 +  d^2 + ^2 d_3  ,

In  general, the
 transformation between the Poincare and the global
 coordinates of 
can be  done as follows (we set the radius of 
 to be 1 and use the Minkowski signature):

X_0=x_0z  =  t  ,   
X_5=  1 2 z  ( 1 + z^2 - x^2_0 + x_i^2) =   t  ,  

X_i= x_iz  = n_i  ,   
X_4= 1 2 z  ( -1 + z^2 - x^2_0 + x_i^2) =  n_4
 ,
  n^2_i + n^2_4 =1  ,    
 t =  2 x_0 1 + z^2  - x^2_0 + x_i^2  
   ,        
z^-1  =  t - n_4  .  
Here  ()
are the coordinates of  :
the  metric is induced from the flat  one
by the  embedding

The unit vector
  (),      , 
 parametrizes the 3-sphere:  .
The obvious point-like solution in global
coordinates , i.e. 

 (with all other angles being trivial),
then becomes  equivalent  to
  t=  ,      =  , 
    
 z=   1      .  
Here  is, in fact, the  angle of large  circle of

and  is the global time  coordinate of .


The energy in global coordinates expressed in terms of
the   Poincare coordinates
 in 
as functions of  both   and   is




 =   d 2   [ (1 + z^2  + x^2
 ) _0 - 2 x_0 ]  ,
 
    _0 =   1 z^2  x_0  ,     
     
1 2z^2     ( z^2  + x^2 )
  ,      
  x^2= - x_0^2 + x_i^2  .   

For the solutions  discussed below  one has the following
relation
 
 z^2 - x^2_0 + x^2_i = 1        .  

Next,  let us    summarize the (conformal-gauge) form of
the
simplest classical string solutions  in written  in global  and Poincare  coordinates
of 
( will stand for the  global and  for the  Poincare
coordinate form).
As was already  discussed above, for  the
point-like string  rotating in  (or, equivalently,
boosted
along a big circle in )

G:       t=  ,         =  ,
 
 P:      x_0 = t  ,     z=  1 t    ,     
=  t =  .  
The spinning string in  is described by (the angle
 is  in ) , 

G:       t=  ,    = w  ,   ()  ,  
    = ^2 ^2 - w^2 ^2  ,  
or, equivalently, by
  P:   
 x_0 = t  ,     z=  1 t
    ,   
 x_1 = r  ,    x_2 = r  ,
     r t   ,  
where ,  , and  are
given by
.
Here   changes from 0 to its maximal value
Arctanh
and
the parameter   is a function of .
In Poincare coordinates the string moves towards
the  horizon (center of AdS), rotating and stretching.
More general solution can be obtained  by combining the
rotation in 
with the  boost in  .


The form of a
 classical  solution cannot  depend on the value of the
 string tension,  i.e. on , which appears as  a
 factor in front
the string  action


 Thus the classical
energy
can be written as  , where  stands
for all
constant parameters
that enter the classical solution. These parameters
should be
 fixed in the standard sigma model loop ()
 expansion.
However,  some of them may be quantized in the full
quantum theory,
i.e. =integer
(being related to canonical momenta the  quantized
parameters should contain
a factor of string tension).
For example, the  global charges  like  the
 and  angular momentum  components
, etc.,   will  take
integer values.












In  AdS we do not have usual S-matrix; proper string vertex operators
are localised at the boundary (in ) and have specific dependence
on radial direction  .  To develop  semiclassical method
we may consider two small  string states or loops (cf. Wilson loops)
at the boundary  and look for  classical  string solutions that connect
them  in .  That will determine a semiclassical
 expression for the string field propagator.  In the limit when
 boundary contours are point-like and simply delta-functions
 we get essentially semiclassics for KG operator in AdS .
 Then euclidean trajectory gives us 2-point function for the 
 operator. This is pure field theory
 in AdS space  -  no string theory used  so far.

A more non-trivial case is  rotating string:
suppose we consider  two  sting states  corresponding
to rotation in   and separated in  at the boundary.
Naive guess is that to do that all we need
is to consider Euclidean (both spacetime and world sheet)
continuation of the rotating string solution
written in Poincare coordinates  and to evaluate the string action on
it. We will presumably need a  cutoff 
plus may be some other  regularization
(cf. the Minkowski w-sheet was singular at the turning points ).

This is a heuristic guess, but it is probably correct
as we know that all works simply on the cylinder- we get the right
dimension  from the classical energy. So presumably
on the 2-sphere the role  of vertex operators is only to
insert proper boundary conditions in mapping 2-sphere to the cylinder,
detail pre-exponential form of the vertex operator is not that
important.One may hope that just
evaluating the euclidean string action
on the euclidean solution  with spin 
(and which  starts at
point  and returns to point )  will give the required result
for the correlator. This will  go beyond the previous example with
large   which was usual point-particle case. 

Semiclassics here will be important  simply  because we
will be ignoring fluctuations as in the Wilson loop examples
plus  we  will have classical (i.e. large )
value  of the  spin .
We will need single fold to minimize the action.






Summary of  attempts to understand  relation between space-time conformal
dimension  and  spin
   for large  from  the
string theory path integral representation
for correlators of string  vertex operators.
 More precisely, we shall start
 from the condition of marginality of the corresponding vertex
operator
following the suggestion  of Polyakov in the large
 case.
The motivation is to  understand better the structure of
vertex operators, at least in the semiclassical limit
(when fermions can be ignored)
 and thus potentially the  relation between the
 correlators of local gauge-theory
operators  and  local string vertex operators
on the two sides of the duality.

Main points:
we first  determine the
vertex operator corresponding to the  string modes on
leading Regge  trajectory and try to compute its
dimension as function of spin  in semiclassical approximation in
path integral  following the same
 idea as suggested by Polyakov
in the case of the vertex operator for the
point-like (graviton)  mode carrying large momentum in .
We clarify the meaning  of complex trajectory in path integral.
Possible application is determination
of -corrected part  of the Klein-Gordon equation
for the space-time field representing the
massive higher spin string mode.
Taking  one may be able to see how
this mode becomes massless ....
Our calculation may have generalizations to other
cases, in particular, to near-conformal ones.

It is non-trivial that this  non-local classical string solution
 is
actually - as in the flat space - described by a local vertex
operator.  Thus AdS/CFT  should extend to string modes in an
expected or  "usual"  way - as relation between local
gauge theory operators and local string vertex operators.
This is actually quite non-trivial, if possible at all.
