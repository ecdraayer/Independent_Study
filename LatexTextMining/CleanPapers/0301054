.4 true cm Pure gauge representation for
general vacuum background fields (Cartan forms) in the generalized

us to formulate dynamics of free massless fields in the
generalized  space-time and to find their (generalized)
conformal and higher spin field transformation laws. Generic
solution of the field equations is also constructed explicitly.

 Introduction 

In the recent papers it was shown that infinite
multiplets of massless higher spins in  flat Minkowski
space-time admit description in terms of ten-dimensional
space-time  with real symmetric bispinor matrix coordinates
, (). A single scalar
field  in  describes massless fields of all integer
spins in  Minkowski space-time upon imposing  field equations
found in. Half-integer spin massless fields are
described analogously by a spinor field . That massless
fields of all spins have to admit some formulation in  was
argued by Fronsdal in the pioneering paper where it was
also stressed that such infinite sets of massless fields have to
form representations of the extension of the  conformal group
 to . Then in it was found that
world-line particle models based on  give rise to  massless
higher spin excitations of all spins. The explicit realization of
the  symmetry by local transformations  was given in
 as well as the generalization of the proposed 
covariant dynamical equations to   with arbitrary even  .

Properties of the  invariant space-time  were
analyzed in. It was shown that the classical solutions
of the field equations define a causal structure and give rise to
correct quantization in a positive definite Hilbert space. Usual
- dimensional Minkowski space-time appears as a  subspace of
the generalized space-time. The analysis of was
performed for the case of flat space-time although the formalism
as a whole works in any (generalized) conformally flat background.
In particular it is interesting to extend this analysis to the
generalized anti-de Sitter space-time which was argued in
 to be the group manifold  ( is even) having
 as the group of motions
realized by left and right group actions on itself. Since the
analysis of  invariant higher spin systems is most
naturally performed in terms of star product algebras, for its
extension to the generalized  space-time it is necessary to
built star-product realizations of left invariant Cartan forms
(i.e., flat connections) on . This is the primary goal of
this paper. Obtained results will allow us to present explicit
formulae for symmetries and solutions of the massless field
equations in the generalized  space-time. The analogous
construction will also be given for the supersymmetric case
associated with .

Let us note that since the star product formalism we apply leads
to compact expressions for  Cartan superforms, apart
from the higher spin problem, the results obtained in this paper
may have applications to other problems where left-invariant forms
of   appear. For example, in it was shown how
 Cartan forms can be used to construct twistor-like
actions for superparticles and possible applications to
superbranes were discussed while in a toy model of 
theory based on  was suggested.

 Generalized conformal symmetry 


The generators  of the conformal algebra
  satisfy the following commutation relations

[L_ab ,L_cd ]&=&_ac L_bd -_bc L_ad 
+_ad L_cb -_bd L_ca ,

[ L_ab ,P_c ]=_ac P_b -_bc P_a , &&
[L_ab ,K_c ]=_ac K_b -_bc K_a ,

[ L_ab ,D]=[P_a ,P_b ]&=&[K_a ,K_b ]=0,

[ P_a ,K_b ]=2(_ab D+L_ab ), && [P_a ,D]=P_a ,
[K_a ,D]=-K_a ,

, . The
conformal  algebra can be realized by the vector fields


L_ab &=&_ac x^c  
x^b  -_bc x^c  x^a  ,

P _a &=& x^a  ,
D=x^a  x^a  ,

K _a &=&2_ac x^c x^b  x^b  
-_bc x^b x^c  x^a  .


The Poincare subalgebra is spanned by  and .
 and  are the generators of special conformal
transformations and dilatations, respectively. To embed the
 algebra  into the -dimensional conformal
algebra  one identifies the  translations with
the mixture of translations and special conformal transformations
in the conformal algebra

P^a _AdS_d  =P^a +^2 K^a .

The generators  and  form the 
subalgebra . This embedding breaks down
the manifest  dilatation covariance because it mixes the
operators  and , which have different dimensions.
 is the dimensionful Wigner-Ino nu contraction
parameter to be identified with the inverse  radius.

The  algebra admits analogous description  in terms of the
generators  and 
, where indices   range from  to  and
 is traceless. The commutation relations are
bCom 
 [K^ ,K^ ]=0 ,
[P_ ,P_ ]=0,


[D,P_ ]=-P_  ,
[D,K^ ]=K^  ,
[D,L_  ^ ]=0,


[L_  ^ ,P_ ]=-_ 
 ^ P_ 
-_  ^ P_ +2 M 
_  ^ P_ ,

[L_  ^ ,
K^ ]=_  ^ K^ 
+_  ^ 
K^ -2 M _  ^ K^ ,


[P_ ,K^ ]=L_  ^ _  ^  +
L_  ^ _  ^  +
L_  ^ _  ^  +
L_  ^ _  ^  + 4 M D( _  ^ 
_  ^  +  _  ^  _  ^ ),

eCom 
[L_  ^ ,L_  ^ ]=_  ^ 
L_  ^
 
-_  ^ L_  ^ .

Note that the generalized Lorentz subalgebra generated by
 is . Analogously to the usual conformal
algebra, generalized translations generated by  form
Abelian subalgebra of . Generalized special conformal
transformations generate a dual Abelian subalgebra.

The commutation relations ()-() can be
realized by the vector fields

P_ = X^  ,
K^ =4
X^ X^  
X^  ,


L_  ^ =2 X^  
X^  -2 M  _  ^ X^  
X^   ,D=X^  
X^  ,

where  are coordinates of .

The simplest way to see that the commutation relations
()-() are indeed of  is to use its
oscillator realization. Actually, let 
and  be oscillators with the commutation
relations

[a _ ,b ^ ]=_  ^ 
,[a _ ,a _ ]=0 ,
[b ^ ,b ^ ]=0.

The generators of  are spanned by  bilinears

T _  ^ 
=1 2 a _ ,b ^  ,
P _ =a _ a _  ,
K ^ =b ^ b ^ .


Instead of working in terms of operators it is convenient to use
the star-product operation in the algebra of polynomials of
commuting variables  and 
old 
(fg)(a,b)=1 ^2M  
f(a+u,b+t)g(a+s,b+v)e^2(s_ 
t^ -u_ v^ )  
d^M ud^M td^M sd^M v.

The star-product defined this way, often called Moyal product,
 describes the product of
symmetrized (i.e Weyl ordered) polynomials of oscillators in terms
of symbols of operators. The integral is normalized in such a way
that

1 ^2M  e^2(s_ 
t^ -u_ v^ )  
d^M ud^M td^M sd^M v=1 ,

so that  is the unit element of the algebra. Eq.()
defines the associative algebra with the defining relations

[a_ ,b^ ]_ = _  ^ ,
[ a_ ,a_ ]_ =0,
[ b^ ,b^ ]_ =0

(). The star product
realization of the generators of  is

T_  ^ =a_ b^  ,
P_ =a_ a_  ,
K^ =b^ b^ ,

where the  generator  decomposes into
the  "Lorentz" and  "dilatation" generators

L_  ^ 
=a_ b^ -1 M _  ^ a_ b^ 
,D=1 2 a_ b^ .

The bilinears of oscillators fulfil the commutation relations
()-().

The embedding of the generalized  subalgebra into the
conformal algebra  is achieved by identification of the
(generalized)  translations with the mixture of translations
and special conformal transformations 

 with some bilinear form . (Note
that keeping the same number of translation generators we  keep
dimension of the generalized space-time intact). As argued in
,  has to have the
factorized form:
, where
 is some nondegenerate antisymmetric form (thus
requiring  to be even). In what follows the form 
will be used to raise and lower indices  according to the rule

A_ =V_ A^ ,
A^ =V^ A_ , 
V_ V^ =_  ^ .

  Thus, the generalized 
translations have the form

P^AdS _ =P_ +^2 V_ 
V_ K^ =
P_ +^2 K_ .

The commutator of  has the form
 
 [P^AdS _ ,P^AdS _ ]=2^2 
 (V_ L^AdS _
 +V_ 
 L^AdS _ +V_ L^AdS _ +
 V_ L^AdS _ ),
 
where  are generators of
the   subalgebra of  which leaves invariant the
symplectic form . The full generalized 
subalgebra is . Its Lorentz
subalgebra  identifies with the diagonal  while
 translations span .

Fock space and  covariant equations 


The  invariant equations of all massless fields in three
and four dimensions are naturally described in
terms of sections of the Fock fiber bundle over . In other
words, consider functions on  taking values in the Fock
module 
Mod  (bX)
where  is some "generating function"
expans 
C(bX)=_m=0 ^ 1 m! c__1 ..._m  
(X)b^_1  ...b^_m  

and  is the Fock vacuum  defined by the relations

a_ ,b^ =0.

 can be realized as an element of the star-product algebra

-2a_ b^  .

Note that the Fock vacuum is the space-time constant projector
vac 
d 
where  is de Rahm differential

d=dX^  X^   ,
d^2 =0.

As shown in the relevant flat space
  covariant equation can be formulated in the form
Fock 
d(bX)0 (bX)=0,

where
go 
w_0 =1 2  dX^ a_ a_  .

That the equation () does indeed describe all conformal
field equations in  and  was shown in and
 for the cases of  and , respectively. In this
paper we will consider the general case of any even . It is
worth to mention that the cases
 of , , and
 were argued  in to correspond to conformal
systems in ,  and , respectively.



The Fock fiber bundle realization of the higher spin equations
guarantees generalized conformal symmetry of the system along with
its infinite-dimensional higher spin extension.  Actually, let
 be some 1-form, taking values in the higher spin algebra
identified with the star product algebra (i.e., the algebra of
regular functions of oscillators acting on the Fock module )

w_0 (X)=_m,n=0 ^ 1 m!n! 
w__0_1 ..._m   ^_1 ..._n  
(X)a__1  ...a__n  b^_1  ...b^_m  ,

which satisfies the zero-curvature condition

 d w_0 =w_0 w_0 .

The equations (), () are invariant under the
gauge transformations

w_0=d,]_ ,

trans 
(bX)=(bX),

where  is an arbitrary infinitesimal gauge
parameter. Any fixed vacuum solution  of the equation
() breaks the local higher spin symmetry to its
stability subalgebra with the infinitesimal parameters
 satisfying the equation
eps 
d_0 -[w_0 ,_0 ]_ =0.


Consistency of this equation is guaranteed by (). As a
 result,
 () admits locally a pure gauge solution
gdg 
w_0 (X)=-g^-1 (X)dg(X),

where  is some invertible element of the star-product
algebra. The global symmetry parameters satisfying ()
then have the form
epss 
_0 (X) = g^-1 (X)g(X),

where an arbitrary -independent element  of the
star-product algebra describes parameters of the global higher
spin symmetry which acts on the solutions of the equation
() (for any given ). In particular, the 
subalgebra spanned by bilinears of oscillators is thus shown to be
a symmetry of the equation ().

Analogously one solves the equation () in the form

 (bX)-1 (bX_0 )
,

where  plays a role of initial data. The
meaning of this formula is that the Fock module
 parametrises all combinations of the
derivatives of the dynamical fields at  which are allowed
to be nonzero by the field equations. The formula ()
plays a role of  the covariantized Taylor expansion reconstructing
generic solution in terms of its derivatives
 at . Note that the Fock module  is not
unitary because it decomposes into an infinite sum of
finite-dimensional (tensor) representations of the generalized
noncompact Lorentz algebra . Nevertheless, the fact
that initial data of the problem are formulated in terms of the
Fock module  is closely related to the fact (see e.g.
) that the collection of unitary massless
representations corresponding to this dynamical system in  is
described by the unitary Fock module  known as singleton
representation of . (It is also well known that unitary
representations of the  conformal algebra associated with
massless fields admit Fock realization in terms of appropriate
oscillators.)
 As shown in, the modules  and   are related
by some Bogolyubov transform.


The formulae (), ()  will play the key role in
our analysis. They allow one to solve the equations of motion
explicitly provided that the gauge function  is found that
corresponds to a chosen zero-curvature connection . This
program for the flat connection () was accomplished in
. In this paper we will find a family of such gauge
functions  that all nonvanishing components of  take
values in the  subalgebra  of
.

 and star product 

As argued in, the generalized  space is identified
with . Let us note that the generalized conformal group
 does not  act globally on  analogously to the
usual conformal group acting in the Minkowski space-time by
Mo bius transformations which have singularities. Recall that
usual Minkowski space-time is the maximal cell of the compactified
Minkowski space. Analogously, the generalized Minkowski space-time
is the maximal cell in the compactified generalized space-time
. The universal covering space of  can be thought of
as a sort of deformation of the generalized Minkowski space-time
being the maximal cell of .

The group  is realized by the  matrices
 satisfying
Group 
U_  ^ U_  ^ V^ =V^ ,

where  is some non-degenerate antisymmetric form
 ( is even). The manifold  is
 dimensional. It can be described by local
coordinates . The simplest parametrization
is

 U_  ^ =((
X))_  ^ ,

where  is inverse "radius" of  introduced to
compensate the space dimensionality of  . Note that
a particular value of  is irrelevant unless there
are some other dimensionful parameters in the theory (e.g., the
gravitational constant). The exponential in () is the
matrix exponential of

X_ ^= V_  X^ .

It is elementary to see that the parametrization ()
solves the group equation (). The exponential
parametrization () provides the universal covering space
 of  (metaplectic group ) topologically
equivalent to , the maximal cell of .

 is invariant under the action of 
generated by left and right actions of  on itself. Using
the oscillator realization of 
we can set

 w_0 (X) =_ (X) a^ b^ 
+h_ (X) (a^ a^  +^2 b^ b^ ),

where the "Lorentz connection"  and the
"frame"  have the form
Lor 
_ =-1 2 (d(U^-1 )_  ^ U_ +
dU_  ^ (U^-1 )_ ),

frame 
h_ =1 4 (dU_  ^ (U^-1 )_ -
d(U^-1 )_  ^ U_ ),

which guarantees that  satisfies (). In the
exponential parametrization () one gets


^ = 2 dX_ (
_0 ^1 (Xt)^ (
Xt)^ dt-_-1 ^0 (
Xt)^ (Xt)^ dt),

frameX 
h^ =
1 4 dX_ _-1 ^1 (
Xt)^ (Xt)^ dt,

where we used  the identity 
 valid
 for an arbitrary matrix . As expected, in
 the flat limit  one recovers  ().

Let us now present the star product pure gauge form  ()
of the connection ()-(). The final result
is
main 
g=1 chX 2   
(-1  (th
X 2 )^ (a_ a_ +^2 b_ b_ )),


g^-1 =1 chX 2   
(1  (th
X 2 )^ (a_ a_ +^2 b_ b_ )).


This formula is derived as follows. Let  be realized in
terms of bilinears of oscillators  satisfying the
commutation relations

[_ ,_ ]_* = 2V_ ,

with the star-product
new  (f*g)()=1 ^M  f(+u)
g(+v)e^-u_ v^   d^M u d^M v .


Consider star-product algebra elements  and  of the
form

g_1 =r_1 e^1 2  f_1 ^ _ _  
,g_2 =r_2 e^1 2 
f_2 ^ _ _  .

with some -independent , ,  and
. Elementary evaluation of the Gaussian integrals
shows that
g_1,2 =g_1  * g_2 =
r_1,2 e^1 2  (f_1 
f_2 )^ _ _  ,

where

r_1,2  =
r_1 r_2  f_1 f_2 +1  

and

 f_1 
f_2 =1 1+f_2 f_1  (1+f_2 )-1 1+f_1 f_2  (1-f_1 )

(with the  usual matrix multiplication on the right hand side:
, 
). Let us look for a
map

 g(U)=r(U)e^1 2 
f^ (U)_ _  

of  into the star-product algebra, such that
comp 
g(U_1 ) *  g(U_2 )= g(U_1 U_2 )=r(U_1 U_2 )e^1 2 
f^ (U_1 U_2 )_ _  .

Equivalently, one can use the inverse map  requiring
eq 
U(f_1 )U(f_2 )=U(f_1 f_2 ) .


As shown in appendix, the multiplication law () requires
 Gom 
U^ (f) =(1+f 1-f )^  .

 The inverse formula is analogous
Gom1 
f^ (U) =(U-1 1+U )^ .

The normalization factor is
factor 
r(U)=2^M 2   U+1  .




To derive () it remains to use () and to
observe that the two  subalgebras of  are generated
by the two mutually commuting sets of oscillators

_ ^ =a_     
V_ b^ =1   (a_ 
b_ ),

satisfying the commutation relations

[^ _ ,^ _ ]_* =2V_ .


The map () has a number of interesting properties. In
particular,
anamor 
U^-1 (f)=U(-f),

inver 
U(f)=-U^-1 (-f^-1 ).

 The property () is a
consequense of the elementary fact (see e.g.) that the
star product  () admits an antiautomorphism 
, i.e.  = 
.   From () it follows that .
The natural group antiautomorphism is . The
formula () identifies the antiautomorphism  in
the star product algebra with that of the group .

The formula () is more interesting. It does not have a
global interpretation within  being singular at degenerate
 (in particular for  and, therefore,
). However, these maps are expected to have global meaning in
 where one can define inversion by analogy with the flat
case considered in

 I(f) = -f^-1 ,I(U) = - U^-1 .

The formula () implies that these two definitions are
consistent with each other. Note that inversion defined this way
maps unit element of  to the central element  which
does not belong to the connected component of unity 
.

Arbitrary coordinates 



The gauge function () corresponds to the exponential
realization of , thus yielding global coordinates which
cover the metaplectic group . Our formalism allows one to
write down explicit form of vacuum gauge connections (Cartan
forms) in arbitrary coordinates, however. Indeed, let us consider
a gauge function of the form

g=1-^2  f^2 (X)
 (-f(X)^ (a_ a_ +
^2 b_ b_ )),

g^-1 =1-^2  f^2 (X)
 (f(X)^ (a_ a_ +
^2 b_ b_ )),

where  is an arbitrary function of
matrix coordinates . The zero-curvature connection
() can be written in the form

w_0=-g(-f)(dX^ f_1 ^  
X^   f_1 ^   g(f_1 ))
_f_1 =f .

Direct computation leads to the expressions for the "Lorentz
connection" and  "frame"

 h^ =dX^ (1 1-^2 f^2  
)^  (f_  ^   
X^   -^2  f_  ^ f_  ^  
X^   f_  ^ )
(1 1-^2 f^2  )_  ^ ,


 ^ =2^2 dX^ 
(1 1-^2 f^2  )^ (
f_  ^  X^   f_  ^ -
f_  ^ f_  ^  X^  )
(1 1-^2 f^2  )_  ^ .

Note that from these formulae it follows that
w(h) 
^ =2h^ f_  ^ -2f^ 
h_  ^ +^2 f^ _  ^ 
f_  ^ .


An arbitrary function  parametrizes various
coordinate choices in . A relationship with the coordinates
of the exponential parametrization obviously is

f(X ) = 1   th X 2 

which implies locally

 sh X 2  = 
f(X ) 1-^2 f^2(X )  ,ch
X 2  = 1 1-^2
f^2(X )  .



The formulae () and () thus provide a
representation for Cartan forms in arbitrary coordinates
associated with one or another function  .
Consider now a few particular examples. Let
  be of the form

f^ (X)=(X)X^ .

The corresponding connections are

h^ =(1 1-^2 ^2 X^2   
)^ (dX_  ^ -^2 ^2 X_  ^ 
dX_  ^ X_  ^ )
(1 1-^2 ^2 X^2   )_  ^ +

+ dX^ (X^-1 )_ 
(X 1-^2 ^2 X^2  )^ ,


^ =2^2 ^2 
(1 1-^2 ^2 X^2   
)^ (dX_  ^ X_  ^  -
X_  ^ dX_  ^ )
(1 1-^2 ^2 X^2   )_  ^ ,

where

 = X  .


Another useful example results from

f^ _  (X)=(X 1 1 - ^2  X^2   
)_ .

The corresponding gauge function is
stereo 
g^ =1+X1-^2 X^2   
X (-(X 1 
1-^2 X^2   )^ (a_ a_ +^2 
b_ b_ )).

In these "stereographic" coordinates the "frame" gets the
following simple form
Stframe 
h^ =1 2 (1 1-^2 X^2   
)^ dX_  ^ 
(1 1-^2 X^2   )_  ^ .

Let us now compare this formula with those obtained in
 to describe massless fields in ()
and ().

Let us first consider the case . Using for example ,
from () one obtains
AdS3 
g=2z  1+z  (-1 1+z  x^ 
(a_ a_ +^2 b_ b_ )),


g^-1 =2z  1+z  (1 1+z  x^ 
(a_ a_ +^2 b_ b_ )),

where . The
"frame" and the "Lorentz connection" are

 h_ =1 2z dx_ ,
_ =1 2z (dx_  ^ x_ +
dx_  ^ x_ ).

To derive this result, which reproduces that of, we
used  a simple fact that, when , any antisymmetric matrix is
proportional to  and, therefore, any polynomial of
matrix coordinates  decomposes into a combination
of its symmetric part 
and antisymmetric part .
 From () it follows that the metric tensor is

g_mn =1 2 h_,n h^  _,m =
1 4 _mn  (1+^2 x_k x^k )^2  ,

where

x_n =_n  ^ x_  ,
x_ =1 2 _  ^n x_n ,

and   is a set of basis symmetric real
matrices normalized to satisfy

_n  ^ _m  _ =2_mn ,

where  is the flat Minkowski metric.

To consider the  case we embed  space-time into
 as follows
emb 
X^ =(
  ),

where , , and  are local
 coordinates which can be expressed via the vector
coordinates  () with the aid of Pauli matrices

as

x^n =^n  _ x^  ,
x^ =1 2 x_n ^n  ^  ,
_n  _ _m  ^ =2_mn .

The  gauge function and gravitational fields resulting from
 () and () are
AdS4 
g=(2z  1+z  )^2 
(-1 1+z  x^ 
(a_ a_ +^2 b_ b_ )),


h_ =1 2z dx_ ,


_ =1 2z (dx_  ^ x_ +dx_ 
 ^ x_ ),
 _ =1 2z (dx^  _ x_ +
dx^  _ x_ ),

where

These  gravitational fields coincide with those found in
.


Symmetries 
Having fixed some vacuum solution  of (), the
local higher spin symmetry is broken down to the global one with
the parameter  satisfying (). Once
the vacuum solution  is fixed in the pure gauge form
() with some gauge function , it is easy to find the
gauge parameter  of the leftover global
symmetry. Indeed let the generating parameter 
in () be of the form

0 (a_ ^ -b^ _ ),

where  is an infinitesimal constant while 
 are constant parameters. An arbitrary symmetry with
star-product polynomial parameters can be obtained via
differentiation of  with respect to  and
. Substitution of () into () gives
gauge 
_0 (a,b;,X)=g^-1 g=
_0 (a_  ^ -b^  _ ),

where

 ^ =ch(X)^ _ -sh(
X)^   _ , ^ =ch(
X)^ _ -sh(X)^ _ .

According to (), in the arbitrary coordinates associated
with the function  of section 
, we have

 _ =(1+^2 f^2 (X) 1-^2 f^2 (X) 
)_  ^ _ -(2f(X) 1-^2 f^2 (X) 
)_  ^ _ ,


 _ =
(1+^2 f^2 (X) 1-^2 f^2 (X) 
)_  ^ _ -^2 
(2f(X) 1-^2 f^2 (X) )_  ^ _ .



The global symmetry transformation of the higher spin generating
function

(bX)_0 
(bX)=_0 
(- _ b^ +1 2  ^  _ )
C(b+ X) 

implies
transC 
C(bX) = _0 C(b+ X)(1 2 
 ^  _ -b^  _ ).

The  dynamical fields are associated here with the scalar 
 and svector 
 in the expansion (). (All other
fields in  are expressed via derivatives of the dynamical
fields.) Their transformation laws are

c(X)=_0 C( X)(1 2 
 ^  _ ),


c_ (X)=_0 (  b^    C(b+ X)
_b=0  -  _  C( X) ) (1 2 
 ^  _ ).

 Differentiating over the parameters
 and  and setting them then equal to zero one
obtains explicit expressions for the higher spin symmetry
transformations associated with any symmetry parameters
 polynomial in the oscillators  and .
In particular, the transformation law with the parameters bilinear
in the oscillators reproduces the  generalized conformal
transformations in the generalized  space-time .



Light-like solutions 
Once the gauge function  is known one solves the system of free
field equation () for all massless fields via
(). Let us consider basis light-like solutions generated
by the initial data of the form.

C(b0)=C_0 (_ b^ ),

where  is an arbitrary constant and  is some
space-time constant spinor. According to () the Fock
representation of the initial data has the form

(b0)0 (_ b^ )
00.

So the dynamical problem is solved by

 (bX)-1 (X)
(b0)C_0  ch
X 2   e^1  (th
X 2 )^ (a_ a_ +^2 b_ b_ ) 
e^_ b^  e^-2a_ b^  .

Elementary evaluation of Gaussian integrals gives the following
result

C(bX)=C_0  chX  
(t^ (^2 b_ b_ +_ _ )+
p_  ^  _ b^ ),

where we use notations

 

equivalent by virtue of () to

t_  ^ =(f(X) 1+^2 f^2 (X) 
)_  ^ ,p_  ^ =
(1-^2 f^2 (X) 1+^2 f^2 (X) )_  ^ .



Let us stress that, according to, for the particular
case of  the obtained expressions describe solutions of
massless equations for all spins in , constructed in
. Using (), these solutions take the form

C(bx)=z(x^  2 (_ _ +
^2 b_ b_ )+z _ b^ ).

For the case of  we get solutions of the  massless
equations discussed in of the form

C(bx)=z (x^  2 (_ _ +
^2 b_ b_ )+z _ b^ ).

Here we make use of the gauge function ().

For the
 dynamical fields we obtain

c(X)=C_0  chX  
e^t^ _ _   ,
c_ (X)=C_0  chX  
p_  ^ _ e^t^ _ _  .


Substitution of  into ()  gives the
global higher spin symmetry transformation of the solution
()

C(bX)=C_0 _0  chX  (
t^ [^2 (
b_ + _ )(b_ + _ )+
_ _ ]+

 +p_  ^ _ (b^  +
 ^ )- _ (b^ +1 2  ^ )).



The flat limit  gives

C(bX)=C_0 _0 (1 2 X^ (_ 
_ -2_ _ +_ _ )+

+b^ (_ -_ )+_ ^ +1 2 
_ ^ ).

For the dynamical fields we get the plane wave solutions

c^f (X)=C_0 e^1 2 X_ ^ ^  
,c^f _ (X)=C_0 _ 
e^1 2 X_ ^ ^  ,

with the twistorial "wave vector"
.

The solution deformed to the  case is not strictly speaking
plane wave. However it is "conformally plane wave" in the sense
that it has still leftover generalized conformal invariances
identified with such global symmetry transformations that

__0  (bX)
It is easy to see using () that this condition is
solved by any parameter of the form

 a_ ),

where  is an arbitrary parameter such that
 and   is an arbitrary function.
Indeed, according to ()

__0  (bX)-1 
C(b0)g^-1  f (^ a_ )
e^_ b^  



Superextension 
The star-product formalism we use admits a straightforward
generalization to the supersymmetric case associated with 
 where  is an arbitrary integer. To describe 
superalgebra let us introduce the Clifford elements 
 satisfying the anticommutation relations
acom 
_i ,_j  _* =_ij ,

where  is some non-degenerate symmetric form.
The Clifford star-product in () is defined (see, e.g.,
) according to

(f*g)()=1 2^L  
f(+)g(+)e^-2^i _i   d^L d^L 
,

where  and  are anticommuting variables. The
supercharges

Q_i =a_ _i , S^ _i =b^ _i 

satisfy

 Q_i , Q_i _*=_ij P_ , 
S^ _i , S^ _j _*=_ij K^ .

Let the Grassmann odd coordinates  be associated
with the -supergenerators. It is convenient to require the
differential  to anticommute to 
and .

It is easy to see that the gauge function

g=e^-X^ a_ a_ -^i a_ _i  

reproduces the flat superspace  vacuum 1-form

w_0 =(dX^ +1 2 d^i  _i  ^ 
)P_ +d^i Q_i .


The left Fock module  satisfies
the  supersymmetric equation
(d-w_0 )
(b,^+ X,)
where the supersymmetric Fock vacuum  in addition to
() is annihilated by the  (in case of even
) or  (in case of odd ) annihilation Clifford
elements  and, when L is odd, it is an eigenvector of
the central element 




Let us now consider free field dynamics in the generalized 
superspace.  The corresponding supersymmetry algebra is
 while the superspace is .
To describe background fields (i.e., Cartan forms) in such a space
we follow the same procedure as for .

The  supergroup is realized by 
matrices , where 
, satisfying the group condition

U_A  ^B U_C  ^D ^AC =^BD ,

where  and








It can be described by the local supercoordinates
 with the aid of the
exponential parametrization
supexp 
U_A  ^B =(X)_A  ^B .

Let us introduce the super-oscillators ,  satisfying
the (anti)commutation relations

a_A b^B -(-1)^_A _B  b^B 
a_A =_A  ^B ,

with respect to the star-product
superstar 
(fg)(a,bX)=1 2^2L ^M  
f(a+u,b+t)g(a+s,b+v)e^2(t^A s_A -v^A u_A )  du dt ds dv,

where the statistics of the integration variables is defined
according to



The integration measure is chosen so that
 1 is the unit element of the star-product algebra
().

Using the oscillator realization of 
 we can set

w_0 =^AB a_B b_A +h^AB (a_B a_A +^2 b_B b_A ).

The analysis analogous to that of section 2 shows that the gauge
function

g=sdet1-^2 f^2 (X) 
(-f^AB (X)(a_B a_A +^2 b_B b_A ))

provides the "Lorentz connection"  and the "frame"
 of the form

_AB =1 2 (dU_A  ^C (U^-1 )_CB +
d(U^-1 )_A  ^C U_CB ),


h_AB =1 4 (dU_A  ^C (U^-1 )_CB -
d(U^-1 )_A  ^C U_CB ),

where

U_A  ^B =(1+f(X) 1-f(X)  )_A  ^B .


The relationship between  and  is analogous
to ()

_AB =2h_A  ^C f_CB -2f_A  ^C 
h_CB +^2 f_A  ^C _C  ^D  f_DB .


Here is the list of the gauge functions and corresponding Cartan
forms in different coordinates.

1. The exponential parametrization ()

g=1 sdetchX 2   (-(th
X 2 )^AB (a_B a_A +^2 b_B b_A )),


_AB = 2 (_0 ^1 (X
t)_A  ^C  X_C  ^D (X t)_DB 
dt-_-1 ^0 (X t)_A  ^C  
X_C  ^D (X t)_DB )


h_AB =1 4 _-1 ^1 (X t)_A  ^C  
X_C  ^D (X t)_DB  dt


2. 

g=sdet1-^2 ^2 X^2  (-
X^AB (a_B a_A +^2 b_B b_A )),


h_AB =(1 1-^2 ^2 X^2  
)_A  ^C 
(dX_C  ^D -^2 ^2 X_C  ^M dX_M  ^N X_N  ^D )
(1 1-^2 ^2 X^2  )_DB -

- (X  1-^2 ^2 X^2  )_AB 
(X^-1 )_M  ^N dX_N  ^M ,


_AB =2^2 ^2 
(1 1-^2 ^2 X^2  )_A  ^C 
(dX_C  ^M X_M  ^D -X_C  ^M dX_M  ^D )
(1 1-^2 ^2 X^2  )_DB ,

where

 = sdetX 


3. The "stereographic" coordinates 


g^ =sdet1-^2 f^2 (X) (-
(X 11-^2 X^2   )^AB 
(a_B a_A +^2 b_B b_A )),


h_AB =1 2 (1 1-^2 X^2   )_A  ^C 
dX_C  ^D (1 1-^2 X^2   )_DB .


The global higher spin symmetry transformation law for the
generating function  with respect to infinitesimal
parameter



in the supersymmetric case is analogous to ()

C(bX)=C(b+ X)
(-(b^A +1 2  ^A ) _A ),

where

 ^A =ch(X)^AB _B -sh(
X)^AB   _B ,  ^A =ch(
X)^AB _B -sh(X)^AB _B .


It is straightforward to extend the rest of the analysis to the
dynamics in the generalized superspace. Also, having found left
invariant forms it is elementary to write down world-line particle
actions (see e.g., for more details and
references). The form of the world-line particle Lagrangian
suggested in is
Lagr 
L=X ^AB w_0 AB (a,bX)+a_A b ^A ,

where  is the vacuum 1-form
satisfying the zero-curvature equation () and dot
denotes the derivative with respect to the world line parameter.
Applying the Stokes theorem and using () the particle
action () can be rewritten in the string form as an
integral over a two-dimensional surface bounded by a particle
trajectory and parameterized by 

S=_^2  (w_0 (a,bX)
w_0 (a,bX)+da_A db^A +

+(da_A  a_A  +db^A  
b^A  )w_0 (a,bX)),

where the pullback is defined as usual

w_0  (a,bX)=d^l X^AB  ^l  
w_0 AB (a,bX),da_A =d^l a_A  
^l  ,db^A =d^l b^A  
^l  .




The problem of calculating Cartan superforms in 
superspace was considered in where a particular
parametrization was found with bosonic Cartan forms being at most
bilinear in fermionic coordinates. Note that the star-product
algebra formalism simplifies some of the computational problems
being reduced to evaluation of elementary Gaussian integrals.


Conclusions 
It is demonstrated how the  star-product algebra formalism can be
applied to the calculation of the vacuum of fields of the
generalized  space associated with 
subalgebra of the recently proposed in generalized
conformal symmetry .  The method is universal working
equally well for the supersymmetric case of   with
 any  and . The formalism of star-product algebra is shown to
be very efficient  for
 solving free field equations in non-trivial
(generalized conformally flat) geometries in   and
calculating Cartan forms in arbitrary coordinates. Hopefully it
may have applications to formulations of world line
(super)particle dynamics as well as (super)string actions in 
theory backgrounds.

Appendix 
Let us prove that the formula
Amain 
g(U)=2^M 2   U+1  
(1 2 (U-1 U+1 )^ _ 
_ )

respects the group multiplication law of , i.e. that the
formula () solves the equation (). Let us look
for  in the form

U(f)=_n=0 ^ a_n f^n ,

where  are some coefficients. Hence
.
Since this expression contains all  on the left side, and
 on the right, we have to find such a function  that
 contains  and  in the correct
order. We have

U(f_1 f_2 )=
_m=0 ^ a_m _n=0 ^ a_n (-1)^n 
((f_1 f_2 )^n (1+f_1 )- (f_2 f_1 )^n (1+f_2 ))^m .

All terms of wrong order must vanish. The analysis of a few first
terms of  gives a hint that the coefficients
are: , i.e.

U(f)=a_0 -a+a 1-f .

The substitution of  into the equation 
 fixes  so that
U(f) 
U(f)=1+f 1-f .

 Now let us prove that the
obtained solution satisfies the equation (), i.e. one has
to check the identity

(1+f_1 f_2 )1-f_2  1+f_2  =(1-f_1 
f_2 )1+f_1  1-f_1  

equivalent to the relation
ident 
 

which is elementary to check.

The normalization factor solves the equation

r(U_1 )r(U_2 ) f_1 f_2 +1  =
r(U_1 U_2 ),

which is obviously true after the substitution ()

2^M 2   U_1 +1  
2^M 2   U_2 +1  
1 U_1 -1 U_1 +1 U_2 -1 
U_2 +1 +1  =
2^M 2   U_1 U_2 +1  .

This completes the proof of eq. (). The proof for
supersymmetric case is analogous.
