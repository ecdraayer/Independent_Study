ABSTRACT 



Five-dimensional braneworld cosmology with deSitter (inflationary) 
brane universe induced by classical and quantum matter is discussed.
It is shown that negative energy phantom field with quantum CFT 
supports the creation of deSitter universe. On the same time,
pure phantom or dust with quantum effects, or Chaplygin gas 
with quantum effects may naturally lead to the occurence of 
Anti-deSitter brane universe but not deSitter one.
It is also interesting that unlike to four-dimensional gravity,
for phantom with (or without) quantum contribution the standard 
cosmological energy conditions may be effectively satisfied.

1. The interpretation of recent astrophysical data 
indicate to the acceleration of the scale factor of 
the observable universe. It looks quite possible now that not only
the early universe passed the inflationary stage, but also 
observable universe is (or enters) in deSitter phase.
The origin of deSitter universe could be caused by the dark energy.
There are recent speculations considering 
negative energy (phantom) theories which produce 
the accelerating scale factor. Unfortunately, such phantom theories 
break the standard cosmological energy conditions. However,
the combination of phantom matter with quantum effects may
improve the situation with energy conditions 
(see, for instance,).

From another side, the dark energy naturally appears in the
braneworld cosmology (see and references therein).
It is sometimes easier to achieve brane FRW-cosmology with 
accelerating scale factor even without brane matter.
Then it is quite interesting to consider braneworld cosmology 
with phantom brane matter and quantum brane CFT in order to
check the possibility for deSitter universe occurence.
The present Letter is devoted to the study of above question.
It is shown that 4d brane deSitter occurs for combination
of brane matter as phantom and quantum CFT
or phantom, quantum CFT and dust.
Moreover, in such a case NEC and WEC may be effectively satisfied.
 For pure phantom brane matter
(unlike to four-dimensional case) there is no
deSitter solution (only Anti-deSitter one) 
but all energy conditions are satisfied.
For combination of matter as Chaplygin gas and quantum CFT
there occurs only brane Anti-deSitter universe.   

 

2. Let the 3-brane is embedded into the 5d bulk space as in ref..
Let   be the metric tensor of the bulk space and  be the unit vector 
normal to the 3-brane. Then the metric  induced on the brane has the 
following form: 
q_ =g_  - n_n_ .
The initial gravitational action is
S &=&d^5 x -g  1 _5^2  R^(5)  - 2+  && + -q ( - 2+ matter Lagrangian density ) .
Here  is the bulk cosmological constant,  is the tension of the brane. 
In the following, the 5d quantities are denoted by the suffix  and 4d ones by 
. In (),  expresses the matter contribution.  
The bulk Einstein equation is given by
1 _5^2 ( R^(5) _  - 1 2 g_  R^(5) )
= T_  
If one chooses the metric near the brane as:
ds^2 = d^2 + q_  dx^dx^ ,
the energy-momentum tensor  has the following form:
T_  = T_ ^bulk matter  - g_  
+ ()(-q_  + _ ) .
Here  is the energy-momentum tensor of the bulk matter  
and  expresses the contribution due to brane matter. 
Without the bulk matter (),  following the procedure 
in, the bulk Einstein equation can be mapped into the equation on the brane:
&& 1 _5^2  ( R^(4) _  - 1 2  q_ R^(4) ) && = - 1 2 ( + _5^2 ^2 6  ) q_  
+ _5^2 6 _  
+ _5^2_  - 1 _5^2 E_  .
Here  is given by
_ =-1 4 _ _^   + 1 12 _  
+ 1 8 q_ _  ^  - 1 24 q_ ^2 .
On the other hand,  is defined by the bulk Weyl tensor 
: 
E_ =C^(5) _ n^n^q_^   
q_^   .
Note that one may identify the effective 4d gravitational constant 
 and 4d cosmological 
constant  with 
1 _4^2 
=6 _5^4   ,
_4 = _5^2 2 ( + _5^2 ^2 6  )  .
As one of the matter fields on the brane, we may consider the phantom field , whose 
energy-momentum tensor has the following form:
_C   = _C _C + 1 2 g_  g^ 
_C _C .
This scalar field has negative energy density and its 
solution in 4d deSitter space is 
C=at + b ,
where a,b are some arbitrary constants.
With above phantom the negative energy density  and the negative pressure   is 
given by
_C=p_C=-a^2 2 
It was argued in that phantom behaves as some effective QFT
 in deSitter space. 

The space is assumed to be 5d AdS space, where
R^(5) _ = - 1 l^2 (g_  g_  - g_  
g_ ) .

Here . Then 
. 
We also assume the brane is the 4d deSitter space, whose metric is taken 
in the following form:
ds^2= - dt^2 + L^2 ^2 t L d_3^2 .
Here  is the metric of the 3d sphere with unit radius. 
Then -component of () has the following form:
0&=& - 3 _5^2 L^2  + 1 2 ( - 6 _5^2 l^2  
+ _5^2 ^2 6  ) + _5^2 6  
(-a^2 2  + _m) && + _5^2 ( a^4 48  - a^2 _m 12  + _m^2 12  
) ,
and -component corresponding to the 3d sphere part is:
0&=& 3 _5^2 L^2  - 1 2 (  - 6 _5^2 l^2  
+ _5^2 ^2 6  ) + _5^2 6  
(-a^2 2  + p_m) && + _5^2 ( a^4 16  - a^2 _m 6  - a^2 p_m 12 
+ _m^2 12  + _m p_m 6 ) .
Here  and  express the (classical or quantum) 
contribution from the matter on the brane besides the phantom contribution. 
The bulk cosmological constant  is 
= - 6 _5^2 l^2   .
By combining () and (), one gets
0&=& _5^2 6  
( - a^2 + _m + p_m ) && + _5^2 ( a^4 12  
 - a^2 _m 4  - a^2 p_m 12  + _m^2 6 
+ _m p_m 6 ) ,

0&=& - 6 _5^2 L^2  + ( - 6 _5^2 l^2  
+ _5^2 ^2 6  ) + _5^2 6  
( _m - p_m ) && + _5^2 ( - a^4 24  + a^2 _m 12  + a^2 p_m 12 
 - _m^2 12  - _m p_m 6  ) .
First we consider the case that there are no matter fields besides the phantom  on the 
brane, that is, . Then Eq.() gives , or . 
For the latter case, Eq.() gives .
Then there might be anti-deSitter solution where 
 but there is no inflationary brane 
solution (compare with).
 
As a next step, we may include the quantum effects from the conformal brane matter. 
As usually, the simplest way to do so is to  consider the conformal anomaly: 
^A=b(F^(4) +2 3  R^(4) ) + b' G^(4)  
+ b"R^(4)  ,
where  is the square of 4d Weyl tensor,  is 
Gauss-Bonnet invariant.
In general, with  scalar,  spinor,  vector fields,   ( or ) 
gravitons and  higher derivative conformal scalars, ,  and  are 
given by
&& b=N +6N_1/2 +12N_1 + 611 N_2 - 8N_HD  
120(4)^2 
&& b'=-N+11N_1/2 +62N_1 + 1411 N_2 -28 N_HD  
360(4)^2  , b"=0 .
Note that  is negative for the usual matter (). 

For inflationary brane (), one gets
_A=-p_A = - 6b' L^4  .
Then Eqs.() and () are: 
0&=& - _5^2 a^2 6  + _5^2 ( a^4 12  
+ b' a^2 L^4  ) ,

0&=& - 6 _5^2 L^2  + ( - 6 _5^2 l^2  
+ _5^2 ^2 6  ) + 2_5^2 b' L^4  && + _5^2 ( - a^4 24  + 3b'^2 L^8  ) .
Especially when there is no phantom field () and 
,
Eq.() is trivial and Eq.() has the following form:
(1 l  - _5^2 b' L^4 )^2 
= 1 L^2 (1 + L^2 l^2 )or 
1 L 1 + L^2 l^2   -1 l  = - _5^2 b' L^4  ,
which (plus sign) reproduces the result (see also,). In other words,
we demonstrated that for the particular choice of the boundary terms, our equation describes 
the quantum creation of deSitter (inflationary) brane which glues two AdS spaces.
Such inflationary brane-world scenario is sometimes called Brane New World.

When , Eq.() gives
a^2 = - 12 b' L^4  + 2 .
Since usually , if , it does not conflict with 
. 
Substituting () into (), one gets
0=  - 6 _5^2 l^2  - 6 _5^2 L^2  
 - _5^2 b' L^4  - 3_5^2 b'^2 L^8   .
Generally Eq.() has non-trivial solution when  is large enough. 
If we define a new variable  by , 
Eq.() can be rewritten as 
0=^2 _5^2  - 3b' ^2 (y + 1 6b' ) + 1 12  
 - 6 _5^2 l^2  - 6 _5^2 y  .
Then in the limit that  is large, one has a deSitter solution 
1 L^2 =0 ,or 1 L^2 = y = - 3b' 
>0 .
Thus, we demonstrated that braneworld which contains phantom 
and quantum CFT on the brane admits deSitter brane solution gluing 
two AdS bulks. It is interesting that in pure 4d space the same type of matter 
also leads to occurence of inflationary universe in easier way.

 As a next case, we consider the situation that the matter 
on the brane is dust

_d=L^3  , p_d=0 .
If also the phantom field  presents on the brane, 
Eqs.() and () are: 
0&=& - _5^2 a^2 6 ( - a^2 + L^2 ) 
+ _5^2 ( a^4 12  - a^2 L^3  
+ ^2 L^6 )  ,

0&=& - 6 _5^2 L^2  + ( - 6 _5^2 l^2  
+ _5^2 ^2 6L^3  ) 
+ _5^2 ( - a^4 24  + a^2 12 L^3  
- ^2 12 L^6 ) .
Eq.() can be solved as
L^3 =1 2  - (6  - a^2) 
2a^4 3  + a^2 3  + ^2 36   .
Then -sign in () always gives a non-trivial solution if . 
If , 
the -sign in () is also a solution. 

We may consider the combination of the dust and the quantum effect coming from 
the conformal anomaly (), where
_m = L^3 -6b' L^4  ,p_m=6b' L^4  .
Without phantom field (), Eqs.() and () 
are:
0&=& _5^2 6L^3  
( + L^3  - 6b' L^4  ) ,

0&=& - 6 _5^2 L^2  + ( - 6 _5^2 l^2  
+ _5^2 ^2 6  ) + _5^2 6  
( L^3  - 12b' L^4 ) && - _5^2 12 ( L^3  - 6b' L^4 ) 
( L^3  + 6b' L^4 )  .
Then in order that Eq.() has non-trivial solution, one gets
6b' L^4  = + L^3   .
By substituting () into (), we obtain
6 _5^2 L^2 =-6 _5^2 l^2 
 - ^2_5^2 12   .
Since the right-hand-side of () is negative, there is no deSitter solution, 
where  although there might be an anti-deSitter solution, where . 
Thus, in such situation brane deSitter space does not occur.

 

3. There are several standard types of the energy conditions
which are usually assumed to be fulfilled in cosmology:
 
Null Energy Condition (NEC): . 
Weak Energy Condition (WEC):  and . 
Strong Energy Condition (SEC):  and .
Dominant Energy Condition (DEC):  and .  
They are violated in four-dimensional space for pure phantom field.
Nevertheless, when phantom field is considered in combination 
with quantum CFT some of the energy conditions survive in 4d deSitter universe.
Let us check what happens with them in our braneworld.

Eqs.() and () give the effective energy density  
and the effective pressure  
_eff = -a^2 2  + _m + 6  
( a^4 48  - a^2 _m 12  + _m^2 12  ) ,
and -component corresponding to the 3d sphere part has the following form:
p_eff = -a^2 2  + p_m + 6   
( a^4 16  - a^2 _m 6  - a^2 p_m 12 
+ _m^2 12  + _m p_m 6 ) .
If there is no non-trivial matter besides the phantom field, one obtains
_eff = p_eff = - a^2 2  + a^4 4 =
a^2(a^2 - 2) 4  .
Then if , 
all the energy conditions are effectively satisfied 
even for pure phantom field. This is an interesting feature
 of phantom braneworld,
as phantom leads to breaking of all energy conditions 
in usual 4d deSitter space. 
On the other hand, without the phantom field 
_eff =_m (1 + _m 2 ) ,
p_eff =p_m + 1  (^2 2  + _m p_m) .
Then if , 
  even if . 
Therefore WEC and DEC are effectively violated. 
Furthermore since
_eff  + p_eff =(_m + p_m)(1 + _m  ) ,
if ,
which is the condition weaker than (), all the energy conditions are effectively violated even if 
 and .  This is known property of deSitter braneworld.
If we consider the contribution from phantom field and the conformal anomaly, 
Eqs.() and () are
_eff  &=& ( -a^2 2  - 6b' L^4 )1  + 1 2 
( -a^2 2  - 6b' L^4  ) ,p_eff &=& -a^2 2   + 6b' L^4  + 6   
( a^4 16  + b' a^2 2L^4   - 3b' ^2 ) .
Then 
_eff  + p_eff  = a^2- 1 + 1 2 (a^2 + 12 b' L^4 )
When , if  or , we have  
and if , we have . 
On the other hand, when , if , 
we have  and if , we have . 
Then, for example, NEC is effectively satisfied if 
& a^2-12b' L^4  - 2&(>0) & a^2-12b' L^4  - 2&(<0)  ,
and WEC is effectively satisfied if 
& -12b' L^4  - 2a^2 -12b' L^4  or  
a^2-12b' L^4  + 4&(>0) & -12b' L^4 >a^2> -12b' L^4  + 4&(<0)  .
Thus, in the presence of phantom and quantum CFT it is easier 
to fulfill the standard energy conditions in the braneworld.

 

4. As a matter, one may consider Chaplygin gas, which satisfies
p_Ch =-A _Ch   ,
where  is a positive constant. For simplicity, we consider  case, that is, 
the case without phantom. Then Eqs.() and () have the following form:
0&=& (+ )(^2 - A)  ,

0&=& - 6 _5^2 L^2  + ( - 6 _5^2 l^2  
+ _5^2 ^2 6  ) && + _5^2 6  ( _Ch  + A _Ch   ) 
+ _5^2 (  - _Ch ^2 12  + A 6  ) .
The solutions of () are easily obtained by
_Ch  = A  ,_Ch =- .
By substituting the former solution  into (), one obtains
6 _5^2 L^2 = _5^2 12 (A  
2)^2 - 2 ^2 - 72 _5^4 l^2  .
Therefore in order that  is real, we obtain the following condition
A  < 2- 2^2 + 72 _5^4 l^2   or  
A  > 2+ 2^2 + 72 _5^4 l^2    .
On the other hand,  choosing the latter solution  in () 
and substituting it into (), one gets
6 _5^2 L^2  = - 6 _5^2 l^2  - _5^2 ^2 12  .
Since the right-hand-side of () is negative, there is no real solution for . 

We may add the contribution due to the conformal anomaly () to (): 
_m = _Ch  - 6b' L^4  ,
p_m = A _Ch   + 6b' L^4  .
Then instead of () and (), one obtains
0&=& (+ - 6b' L^4 )(^2 - A)  ,

0&=& - 6 _5^2 L^2  + ( - 6 _5^2 l^2  
+ _5^2 ^2 6  ) + _5^2 6  ( _Ch  
+ A _Ch   - 12b' L^4  ) && - _5^2 12 (_Ch  - 6b' L^4 )
(  _Ch  - 2A _Ch   + 6b' L^4 ) .
The solution of () is:
_Ch  = A  ,_Ch =-+ 6b' L^4  .
Substituting the former solution  into (), we get
6 _5^2 L^2 = _5^2 12 (A  
(2- 6b' L^4 ))^2 
 - 2 ^2 - 72 _5^4 l^2  .
It is difficult to solve () with respect to  but 
 in order to get real , the following condition 
should be satisfied:
A  &<& (2- 6b' L^4 )
- 2^2 + 72 _5^4 l^2  or  A  &>& (2- 6b' L^4 )
+ 2^2 + 72 _5^4 l^2    .
Substituting the latter solution 
 () into (), one gets
6 _5^2 L^2  = - 6 _5^2 l^2  - _5^2 ^2 12  .
Since the right-hand-side of () is negative, there is no real solution 
for . Then there might be an anti-deSitter solution, where   but there is 
no deSitter solution, where .

To conclude, the combination of Chaplygin gas with quantum CFT
( unlike to phantom with quantum CFT) 
does not support the occurence of deSitter brane in AdS bulk.
On the same time, the combination of brane quantum CFT and  
phantom may lead to the inducing of 4d deSitter universe. 
It would be interesting to develop such inflationary braneworld 
scenario in more detail.
