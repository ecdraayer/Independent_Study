Abstract

We study aspects of the accelerating cosmologies obtained from
the compactification of vacuum solution and S2-branes of superstring/M
theories. Parameter dependence of the resulting expansion of our universe
and internal space is examined for all cases.
We find that accelerated expansions are obtained also from spherical
internal spaces, albeit the solution enters into contracting phase eventually.
The relation between the models of SM2- and SD2-branes are also discussed,
and a potential problem with SD2-brane model is noted.



Introduction 

Recent discovery of the cosmic acceleration calls for explanation within
the framework of fundamental theory of superstring/M theories. It has been
known for some time that it is difficult to derive such cosmologies from
the compactifications of solutions in superstring/M theories
and has been considered that there is a no-go theorem which excludes such
possibility if one chooses the internal space compact and static
manifolds .

Recently it has been shown that this no-go theorem can be overcome
if one allows time-dependence, and a solution of the
vacuum Einstein equations with compact hyperbolic internal space
has been proposed for such a model .
The solution turned out  to be a special case of the time-dependent
solutions discovered before . Moreover it has been
found  that similar accelerating cosmologies can be obtained
for S(pacelike)M2-branes  and that not only the
hyperbolic but also flat internal spaces give similar behavior.
The SM2-brane case is also studied in ref. . Later SD2-brane,
which can be obtained from SM2-brane by dimensional reduction, has been
discussed in ref. . However, problem with strong string coupling
in SD2-brane casts a question on the validity of the results at least for
flat internal space. Related cosmologies with accelerated expansion are
also discussed in refs. .

In ref. , the degree of the expansion factor during the period of
the accelerated expansion has been studied for SM2-brane, with the small
result of order 2. This appears to be too small to solve cosmological
issues such as the horizon or flatness problems, which require the magnitude
. Since the solutions contain some parameters, it is
interesting to examine if there is a possibility of evading this problem.

In this paper, we study aspects of these models of accelerated
expansions including parameters for vacuum, SM2-brane and SD2-brane solutions.
We also estimate how the expansion factors change by varying the parameters.
It turns out that the factors can change but not enough to get around
the difficulty mentioned above. We also find that it is possible to have
accelerated expansion for spherical internal space too for S2-branes
(but not for vacuum solutions) if one chooses parameters appropriately,
although the universe enters into contracting phase after some period.
We further discuss how SD2-branes are obtained from SM2-branes by
dimensional reduction. One can thus see that the features of the
cosmologies from SD2-brane is basically similar to those from SM2-brane.
In fact we find that qualitative behavior does not change much, as expected.
However, there is a potential problem with the SD2-brane
model because it often suffers from the strong string coupling and
then it is not clear if we can trust the result in this picture.
It is known that the strong string coupling can be understood as the
11-th dimension becoming large, so that the description by M theory
becomes more relevant .

This paper is organized as follows. In sect. 2, we first discuss the
relation of the vacuum and our S-brane solutions, and study the cosmologies
from the vacuum solutions. In this case, there is no adjustable parameter
and the result does not change.
In sect. 3, we examine the cosmologies from SM2-brane. The hyperbolic, flat
and spherical internal spaces are discussed in subsections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3,
respectively. We study these cases by changing a parameter, and find
that an interesting model can be obtained also from spherical internal space.
In sect. 4, the way how SD2-brane is obtained from SM2-brane is explicitly
shown. We discuss the cosmologies in this case briefly.
We also note that in many cases in this kind of models, the string coupling
becomes strong so that the picture becomes obscure. We show how this
can be avoided for compactification on hyperbolic manifolds, but there
seems to be no way to avoid this for flat and spherical manifolds.
Finally sect. 5 is devoted to conclusions and discussions.

In the course of writing this article, a paper appeared with related
observations on the spherical internal space for SM2-brane .


Vacuum solution and S2-brane 

Generality 

It is convenient to write the -dimensional solution as
ds^2 = ^-n (t) ds_E^2 + ^2(t) d_n, ^2,
where  is the dimension of the internal spherical (),
flat () or hyperbolic () spaces, whose line elements are
, and
ds_E^2 = -S^6(t) dt^2 + S^2(t) dx ^2,
describes the 4-dimensional spacetime. The form of dsol  is chosen
such that the metric in 4sol  are in the Einstein frame. The solution
in refs.  is given as
(t) &=& e^-3t/(n-1)  (3(n+2)/n  (n-1)
(3(n+2)/n  t) )^1 (n-1)  , S(t) &=& e^-(n+2)t/2(n-1)  (3(n+2)/n  (n-1)
(3(n+2)/n  t) )^n 2(n-1)  .
with hyperbolic internal space.

If we take the time coordinate  defined by
dS^3(t) dt,
the metric 4sol  describes a flat homogeneous isotropic universe with
scale factor , and  gives the measure of the size of internal
space. The condition for expanding 4-dimensional universe is that
dS d >0.
Accelerated expansion is obtained if, in addition,
d^2S d^2 >0.
It has been shown that these can be satisfied for  and for certain
period of negative  (with the convention ) which is the period
that our universe is evolving ( and  are two disjoint possible
universes) .

We have noted  that the above solution is actually a special
case of the solutions derived in ref. . The theory considered
there is given by the action for -dimensional gravity coupled to a
dilaton  and  different -form field strengths:
I = 1 16 G_d  d^d x -g  [
R - ()^2 - _A=1 ^m 1 2 n_A!  e^a_A  
F_n_A ^2 ].
This action describes the bosonic part of  or  supergravities;
we simply drop  and put  and  for , whereas we
set  for the NS-NS 3-form and  for forms coming
from the R-R sector.
The field strength for an electrically charged S-brane is given by
F_t _1 _q+1   = __1 _q+1   E, 3 
(n_A = q+2),
where  stand for the tangential directions to
the S-brane. The magnetic case is given by
F^_q+2  _p a_1 a_n   = 1 -g  
e^-a  ^t _q+2  _p a_1 a_n  E,
3  (n_A = d-q-2)
where  denote the coordinates of the -dimensional
hypersurface .

In ref.  a single S-brane solution was given, and in
ref.  general orthogonally intersecting solutions were derived
by solving field equations. Our solutions restricted to a single S-brane
with -dimensional world-volume in -dimensional space  are
(hereafter the subscript  is not necessary and is dropped)
ds_d^2 &=& [c (t-t_2)]^2 q+1   
[ e^2c_0 t+2c_0'   - e^2ng(t)  dt^2
+ e^2g(t) d_n, ^2 && 20  + _[c(t-t_2)]^- 2
^()     e^2 c_t+2c_(dx^)^2], 

E &=& 2(d-2)   e^c(t-t_2)
-a c_q  c_c(t-t_2) ,c = _q  c_1 2  c_a, &=& (d-2)a   c(t-t_2)
+c_t + c_where  and  corresponds to electric (magnetic) fields.
The coordinates  parametrize the -dimensional
space, within which -dimensional world-volume of S-brane is
embedded, and the remaining coordinates of the -dimensional spacetime
are the time  and coordinates on compact -dimensional spherical
(), flat () or hyperbolic () spaces.
We have also defined
&& = (q + 1) (d-q-3) + a^2 (d-2), && ^()  =

 and 's are integration constants which satisfy
&& c_0 = q+1  c -_p  c_ n-1 , 
c_0' = -_p  c_n-1 , && c_= c_- ^() -q-1  c, 
c_= c_+ (d-2)a  c.
These must further obey the condition
1 n-1 (_p  c_)^2
+ _p  c_^2 + c_^2= n(n-1) ^2.
The free parameters in our solutions are

The time derivative of  gives the field strengths of antisymmetric
tensor and in our convention they are given as

e^-_q c'_+ac_dx^_q+2  dx^_p Vol (_n, ),
for electric (first line) and magnetic (second line) fields, where
Vol is the unit volume form of the hypersurface
 and  represents dual.
We can check that  for SM- and SD-branes.
The above solution includes that in ref. , and the precise
relation is given in. (If we also use the relation
 which was not given
in eq. (40) there, we reproduce 
.)

For the general S2-brane obtained from the solution oursol  by putting
, we find that
it takes the form dsol  and 4sol  with
(t) &=& [c(t-t_2)]^3/  e^g(t) + c_0 t + c_0' , S(t) &=& [c(t-t_2)]^(n+2)/2  e^ng(t)/2 +(n+2)(c_0 t
+ c_0')/6 ,
where
&& c = 3c-1 2  c_a, c_0 = 3  c - 3 n-1 c, c_0' =-3 n-1 c', && = 3(n+2) n(n-1)^2  c^2 + 1 2n(n-1) c_^2 .
We are now going to discuss how this S2-brane solution includes the vacuum
solution vfactor  and the resulting cosmologies .


Vacuum solution 

The relation between  and  and  in eq. oursol1 
is derived  under the assumption that we have the independent field
strengths . In the absence of these, we can disregard this relation
and should set  to zero.


It is then easy to see that the solution oursol  reproduces
dsol -vfactor  for  without dilaton
() . The scale factor is simply genfactor  with
 which coincides with vfactor . On the other hand,
the S-brane solutions derived in assume nonzero field strengths
from the start, and one cannot simply get the vacuum solution.

The condition of the expansion cond1  for the vacuum solution vfactor 
is n_1(t) -1-3n n+2  (3(n+2) n  
c(t-t_1))>0,
where we have also included parameters  and .
The condition cond2  gives
3(n-1) (n+2)^2[3(n+2)/n  c(t-t_1)]  - n_1^2(t) > 0.
The parameter  and  can be absorbed into the shift and rescaling
of the time . Hence without loss of generality, we can set  and
 (changing  gives the change in the scale of time).
There is a singularity in  at , but the time  run from 0
to infinity while  runs from  to 0, which is an infinite
future for any event with  and hence the evolution of our universe
can be restricted to .

The left hand side of these eqs. for  are shown in Fig. ,
and the behavior of the scale factor  in vfactor  is depicted in
Fig. .

 
 
The lhs of eq. cond01  (solid line) and cond02  (dashed line). 

 
 
The behavior of the scale factor  in vfactor . 
We see that there is a certain period of negative time
that the conditions cond01  and cond02  are satisfied .
The period of the accelerated expansion can be adjusted by changing the
constant , but this does not affect the resulting expansion factor.
The scale factor vanishes in the infinite past, but diverges in the infinite
future.

The expansion factor  during the accelerated expansion is given by the
ratio of  at the starting time  and ending time  of the
acceleration. These are read off from Fig.  as
T_1 -0.73, T_2 -0.07.
If we keep the parameter ,  and this simply changes the scale of
the time by a constant multiplicative factor. We then find that the expansion
factor is
A =S(T_2) S(T_1)  2.91.
This value is too small to explain the cosmological problems.
Note that there is no parameter to improve  here.

The behavior of the size of the internal space is also shown in Fig. .
Though it appears as if the internal space rapidly expands in terms of
, the actual time coordinate is  and the region  is
actually long.


 
 
The behavior of the size of the internal space 
in vfactor . 

When the acceleration starts,  shrinks but eventually starts expanding,
and the ratio of the sizes during the accelerated expansion is 2.18.
As observed for SM2-brane case , there is no stable point in the
size of the internal space, and in the infinite future and past its
size goes to infinity. This seems to be the common problem in the hyperbolic
compactification . We will find this behavior in other cases.

We have also examined other internal spaces, but without any adjustable
parameter we find that neither flat nor spherical spaces give accelerating
cosmologies .


SM2-brane 

The SM2-brane in M-theory can be obtained from oursol  by putting
 without dilaton and .
We also put  and then
 is determined from condconst .
The solution oursol  then gives
ds_d^2 &=& [3c(t-t_2)]^2/(n-1)  [ -e^2ng(t)-6c'/(n-1)  dt^2
+ e^2g(t)-6c'/(n-1) d_n, ^2 && 20  + [3c(t-t_2)]^- 2(n+2)/3(n-1)2c_dx ^2].
This is the universe dsol -4sol  with
(t) &=& [3c(t-t_2)]^1/(n-1)  e^g(t) -3c'/(n-1) , S(t) &=& [3c(t-t_2)]^(n+2)/6(n-1)  e^ng(t)/2 -(n+2)c'/2(n-1) .
We now discuss three internal spaces ints  separately.


Hyperbolic internal space 

The conditions cond1  and cond2  for  of our interest and
hyperbolic internal space  are (again shifting the time to set )
&& n_2(t) 3 4  [3c(t-t_2)]-21  4 
(33/7 ct)>0, 

&& 9 8 (1 ^2[3c(t-t_2)] 
+ 1 ^2(33/7 ct) ) - n_2^2(t) > 0.
Here we can again consider that our universe evolves only for .
The left hand side of these eqs. for  and  are shown in
Fig. , and the behavior of the scale factor  in mfactor  is
depicted in Fig. . We again see that there is a certain period of
negative time that these conditions are satisfied .

 
 
The lhs of eq. cond11  (solid line) and cond12  (dashed line). 

 
 
The behavior of the scale factor  in mfactor . 

The starting time  and ending time  of the acceleration are
read off from Fig.  as T_1 -0.78, T_2 -0.15.
We then find that the expansion factor is
A 2.17.
This value is too small to explain the cosmological problems.
However, here is a parameter  in contrast to the vacuum solution,
and it is interesting to check what effect this may have.

We have examined the conditions for various choices of  and found that
the typical behavior for positive  is basically the same as 
case, but the period of the accelerated expansion changes slightly.
For example, for , we find
T_1 -0.73, T_2 -0.06.
and the value of the expansion factor during the accelerated expansion
improves:
A 3.13.
This is still not enough improvement for cosmological applications.
Increasing the value of  does not affect the numerical value of 
much. The behavior for negative  is also basically the same, but the
expansion factor is worse; one typically gets .

The behavior of the size of the internal space for  is also shown
in Fig. .


 
 
The behavior of the size of the hyperbolic internal space 
in mfactor . 

As observed in , there is no stable point in the size of the
internal space, and in the infinite future its size goes to infinity.
There is no significant change in this behavior if we change the parameter
.


Flat internal space 

The conditions cond1  and cond2  for  and flat internal
space  are
&& n_3(t) 3 4  [3c(t-t_2)]+21  4 >0, 

&& 9 8 1 ^2[3c(t-t_2)]  - n_3^2(t) > 0,
where we have chosen the plus sign in eq. ints  since minus sign cannot
give expanding universe.

Here since  does not have any singularity and is positive, the time
 runs from  to  while the time  runs from 0
to  monotonously. The left hand side of these eqs. for  and
 are shown in Fig. , and the behavior the scale factor
 in mfactor  is depicted in Fig. . We again see that there
is a certain period of negative time that these conditions are
satisfied .

 
 
The lhs of eq. cond21  (solid line) and cond22  (dashed line).

We again read off the starting time  and ending time  of the
acceleration from Fig.  as
T_1 -0.48, T_2 -0.04,
and the expansion factor is
A 1.35.
This value is again too small to explain the cosmological problems.
The conditions cond21  and cond22  depend only on ,
so changing  simply shifts the evolution of the spacetime and
does not give any difference.

The behavior of the size of the internal space is also shown in Fig. .

in mfactor . 

There is no stable point in the size of the internal space, and in the
infinite future its size goes to infinity.


Spherical internal space 

The conditions cond1  and cond2  for  and spherical internal
space  are (again shifting the time to set )
&& n_4(t) 3 4  [3c(t-t_2)]
- 21  4  (33/7  ct)>0, 

&& 9 8 (1 ^2[3c(t-t_2)] 
- 1 ^2(33/7  ct) ) - n_4^2(t) > 0.
The time ranges of  and  are the same as the flat internal space.
We have reported the result for  in ref. ;
the result indicates that there is no period of accelerated expansion.
We have examined what happens if we change the parameter .
The results for  and  are shown in Fig. .
We find that there is a certain period of negative time that the
conditions cond31  and cond32  are satisfied, though the
universe begin contraction after some positive time. The behavior of
the scale factor  in mfactor  is depicted in Fig. .
It contracts on both ends .

The acceleration starting time  and ending time  are read off from
Fig.  as
T_1 -1.48, T_2 -1.04,
and the expansion factor is
A 1.35.
This value is again too small to explain the cosmological problems.
We have also checked that the typical behavior for negative  is again
basically the same as  case, but the period of the accelerated
expansion and the value of the expansion factor during the accelerated
expansion change.

A different behavior is observed for positive . We find the
acceleration occurs while the universe is already contracting for ,
as shown in Fig. . We do not know if this case gives any
interesting cosmology.
The behavior of the size of the internal space is also shown for 
in Fig. .

There is no stable point in the size of the internal space, and in the
infinite future its size goes to infinity. There is no significant change
in this behavior if we further change the parameter .


SD2-brane 

In this section, we discuss accelerating cosmologies from SD2-brane.

SD2-brane obtained from SM2-brane 

We first show how the SD2-brane can be obtained by dimensional reduction
from SM2-branes. Though it is possible to examine general dimensions,
we restrict ourselves to  here. We will see why the qualitative
behavior is similar to SM2-brane.

The 10-dimensional metric in the string frame is obtained from the
11-dimensional one by the relation
ds_11 ^2 = e^-2/3  ds_10,s ^2 + e^4/3  dx_10 ^2.
In our solutions oursol , we consider SM2-brane by taking ,
but we set  with one extra coordinate outside SM2-brane, in which
direction we make dimensional reduction. We choose  to be
the SD2-brane world-volume and  the direction of dimensional reduction.
We further set  but leave
 and  arbitrary. There is no dilaton which comes from the metric
as 11metric  upon dimensional reduction, and we put .
This gives
&=& 1 4  [3c (t-t_2)] + 3 4  (c+2c_4)t
+ 3 2  c'_4, ds_10,s ^2 &=& e^2/3  [3c (t-t_2)]^1/3 [
e^-(c+2c_4)t/5 - 2(3c'+c_4')/5   - e^12 g(t)  dt^2
+ e^2g(t) d_6, ^2 && 20  + [3c(t-t_2)]^-1  e^2c'  dx ^2 ].
In the Einstein frame , this reduces to
ds_10,E ^2 &=& [3c (t-t_2)]^3/8 [ e^-3(c+2c_4)t/40-3(8c'
+c_4')/20   - e^12 g(t)  dt^2 + e^2g(t) d_6, ^2
 && 20  + [3c(t-t_2)]^-1  e^(c+2c_4)t/8+(8c'+c_4')/4  dx ^2
].
The relation to the notation of is given by
c=16 15  , c_4=5 8  c_1 -8 15 ,
which must obey condconst  or
30 ^2 = 128 25 ^2 + 15 32  c_1^2.
The scale factor  and  are given as
(t) &=& [(16/5)(t-t_2)]^3/16  e^g(t) -3c_1t/64 - 3c'/4 ,S(t) &=& [(16/5)(t-t_2)]^1/4  e^3g(t) -c_1 t/16 - c' ,

&=& 1 4 [(16/5)(t-t_2)] +15 16 c_1 t +c_where we have also put
c'= 8c'+c_4' 10 , c_= 3 2  c_4'.
On the other hand, if we consider the SD2-brane with 
 in eq. oursol , we get precisely dfactor 
with different parametrization
c=+ 5 64 c_1, c_= 15 16 c_1 - 4 5 , c' = 5 4  c'.
The scale factors dfactor  almost coincide with those for SM2-brane
in mfactor  if we choose , though the power of the  is
slightly different and there is an additional  term in the
exponent. However, the difference is small and one may expect
that qualitative features remain the same. This is the reason why one finds
basically the same behavior as SM2-brane. To confirm this, we present
some results for SD2-brane below.

Continuing this reduction, one should leave the constants  arbitrary
in order to get general lower-dimensional solutions;
in the SM2-brane solution of ref. , homogeneity of the space
outside the S-brane is assumed, and then general solutions cannot be
obtained by dimensional reduction. If we start with our solutions without
putting any relations among 's, we can simultaneously discuss
all possible cases. This is another virtue of our solutions, in addition
to the fact that they cover the vacuum solution.


Hyperbolic internal space 

The conditions cond1  and cond2  give
&& n_5(t) 4 5 [(16/5)(t-t_2)] - 3(5t)
-c_1 16  >0, 

&& 32^2/25 ^2[(16/5)(t-t_2)] 
+ 15^2/2 ^2(5t)  - n_5^2(t) > 0,
where we have again set  by a shift of time.

The conditions cond41  and cond42  for 
was examined in, and the qualitative behavior is found to be the
same as SM2-brane, as expected. We have studied how the behavior changes
if we change parameter . The results for  are shown
in Figs.  and , respectively.

 
 
The lhs of eq. cond41  (solid line) and cond42  (dashed line)
for . 

 
 
The lhs of eq. cond41  (solid line) and cond42  (dashed line)
for . 
The expansion factor is also obtained for  as
A 3.28.
Again similarly to the SM2-brane, the positive  gives bigger ,
but not so much change. We thus see that the behavior does not change
qualitatively from the case of SM2-brane, as expected.

However, there is a potential subtlety in this picture of SD2-brane.
This is because the string coupling is given by the dilaton as ,
and it may diverge for the solution dfactor  for certain range of
parameters. If this happens, quantum effects dominate and we cannot simply
trust the result. Fortunately there is a safe range of parameters for this
compactification on hyperbolic internal space because the time range is
restricted to . From eq. dfactor , one finds that if the condition
c_1 >64 75 
is satisfied, we can remain in the weak coupling region and the above picture
may be trusted. The above choice of the parameters is within this range
so the above result may be correct. However we will see that this may
be a more serious problem for other internal spaces.


Flat internal space 

The conditions cond1  and cond2  give
&& n_6(t) 4 5 [(16/5)(t-t_2)] + 3-c_1 16 
>0, 

&& 32^2/25 ^2[(16/5)(t-t_2)]  - n_6^2(t) > 0.
This case for  was examined inwith results similar to SM2-brane again, and one can see that the change
of  simply gives the shift in time of the whole behavior without
new feature.

However, in this case the time range is from  to  so that
the dilaton dfactor  always gives strong string coupling somewhere for
large  whatever the choice of the parameters are, and it is not clear
if this classical analysis is valid.
So we cannot conclude whether this model gives a reasonable result.
It is actually known that this limit is the one in which 11-th dimension
becomes large . This case is better described in the SM2-brane
picture, with large 11-th dimension. This is what we have already analyzed
in the preceding section.


Spherical internal space 

The conditions cond1  and cond2  give
&& n_7(t) 4 5 [(16/5)(t-t_2)] - 3(5t)
-c_1 16  > 0, 

&& 32^2/25 ^2[(16/5)(t-t_2)] -15^2/2 ^2(5t) 
- n_7^2(t) > 0,
where we have again set  by a shift of time.

We have examined the behaviors for 
for  which are shown in Figs.  and , respectively.

 
 
The lhs of eq. cond45  (solid line) and cond46  (dashed line)

The lhs of eq. cond45  (solid line) and cond46  (dashed line)
for . 
We find again that there is a possibility of getting accelerating cosmologies
for negative , and also for positive  though in this case the
universe is contracting. The typical features of the solution is essentially
the same as SM2-brane case. Here again this internal space suffers from
the problem of strong string coupling.
It is not clear if we can trust this result, but the analysis in SM2-brane
seems to support the basic behavior.


Conclusions and discussions 

We have examined accelerating cosmologies obtained from time-dependent
solutions in superstring/M theories including parameter dependence,
with the hope to get bigger expansion factors.
As a new feature, we have found that it is also possible to obtain
accelerating phase not only for hyperbolic and flat internal spaces but
also for spherical space. In the last case, the universe eventually enters
into the contracting phase.

The obtained expansion factors of our universe seem to be rather small to
solve the horizon and flatness problems, and this seems to be typical
problem in these models. This factor improves slightly if we change
parameters of the models, but still not enough.

We have also shown the relation between SM2-brane and SD2-brane,
and thus have given the reason why the qualitative behavior is
basically the same as SM2-brane. There is also a problem associated with
the strong string coupling in SD2-brane, in which case one must return
to the SM2-brane picture.

One of the common features of the above results is that our spacetime starts
from very small size while the internal space is fairly large, and our
scale factor grows in time while the size of the internal space shrinks
for a while (perhaps in our time). It is interesting to further pursue
this possibility.

An obvious generalization of our work would be to consider more general
case allowing the full parameters in our solution oursol .
Also it would be interesting to examine other possibility of the internal
space such as product space. It is extremely important to investigate how
one can achieve expansion factor large enough to explain the cosmological
problems in this context.
