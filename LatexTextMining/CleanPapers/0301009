Abstract 




The superfield light cone gauge formulation of
 SYM in plane wave background is developed. We find a
realization of superconformal symmetries in terms of a
light cone superfield. An oscillator realization of superconformal
symmetries is also obtained.





Introduction 


The new maximally supersymmetric solution of IIB
supergravity with Ramond-Ramond flux attracted recently
considerable interest. On the one hand,
the light cone gauge Green-Schwarz superstring
action in this background is quadratic in both  bosonic and
fermionic superstring  fields, and therefore, this model can
be explicitly quantized. On the other hand,  in
 it was proposed that this superstring in plane wave
background corresponds to a certain (large R-charge)  sector of
the  SYM theory. Given that the plane wave superstring model
can be quantized explicitly one can study
the duality correspondence between string states and gauge theory
operators at the string-mode level. The  new duality
 turned out
to be very fruitful and this renewed interest in various aspects of
string/gauge theory correspondence.

One of the important aspects of the string/gauge theory correspondence
is to find explicit and precise relation between string
states and appropriate operators of gauge theory.
For the case of plane wave duality solution to this problem was
suggested in by introducing the operators which are
often referred to as BMN operators.
These operators were extensively studied in the literature
(see for instance
and references in)
and various
improvements of the original BMN operators were
suggested
.
Unfortunately,
the guiding principles which would allow one to fix the precise
form of these operators are not clear so far(It seems
natural to expect that these operators should be derivable from the
microscopic open-string
approaches to the supersymmetric plane wave  branes.
Discussion  branes in the framework of
microscopic approach may be found in
.) .
Recent interesting discussion of this theme may be found in
. One of the important inputs in establishing
a precise
correspondence might be the geometry of space-time in which fields
of SYM are propagating. Usually, the Hamiltonian
formulation of conformal field theory for SYM is
considered
in  background(Discussion of
SYM theory in various curved backgrounds may be found in
. Plane wave SYM does not fall in the cases
considered in. Detailed study of the
Hamiltonian formulation of SYM in  background may be
found in. Relevance of a curved background
for SYM was discussed (in the original AdS/CFT context) in
.) . The space-time symmetries of this
background, however, are in sharp contradiction with the (super)symmetries
of the plane wave superstring model.
Therefore, taking into account that
some (super)symmetries of plane wave SYM action
are look the same as (super)symmetries of the type IIB superstring in
plane wave Ramond-Ramond background it was suggested
 that the SYM theory
in plane wave background may
be preferable in the context of the new duality.

Another argument in favor of the discussion of the plane wave SYM is that
 plane wave background can be obtained via Penrose
limit from  background. Given that the SYM in 
is used for study of holography in the original context of AdS/CFT
correspondence we expect
that    plane wave background is most appropriate for the study
of holographical issues of the plane wave duality.
Thus, it seems natural to expect that in order to
match the states of the plane wave superstring and operators of SYM
the Penrose limit on the
string theory side should be supplemented by the Penrose limit
on the SYM side.
Various alternative discussions of
plane wave holography may be found in.

In we developed the
Hamiltonian light cone gauge formalism
for the plane wave SYM in component form. In this paper we continue the
study of the
plane wave SYM and develop a superfield formulation of this theory.
Superfield formulation turns out to be more compact, and we expect
that this formalism will be helpful in future studies (similar to one
in).
Independently of the above string/gauge theory duality motivation
it seems interesting to study SYM theory in curved backgrounds and the
present work may be also considered as an effort in this direction.


Action of plane wave  SYM in light cone superspace 


Component form of light cone gauge action of  SYM is
formulated in terms bosonic fields , 
is spin one field and  are six scalar fields, and
-component fermionic field  which satisfies the
constraint . Because on plane wave
Ramond-Ramond superstring theory side  symmetries are
broken to  it is natural to reduce manifest
SYM R-symmetries  to the R-symmetries .
Another technical advantages in reducing manifest SYM R-symmetries
is related with the fact in this way one can formulate SYM theory
in terms of unconstrained light cone superfield. As in the flat
space-time the superfield formulation of  SYM could be
developed by using a certain superspace whose 16 real-valued
fermionic coordinates related with the  which form
Glifford algebra ^,^
=1 4 (^+)^ , ^+However the superfield based on such
fermionic coordinates should satisfy complicated constraints
. To avoid such superfield description one
needs to introduce Grassmann coordinates instead of Clifford
coordinates . To this
end we break manifest R-symmetries  to R-symmetries
 and introduce the fermionic 'coordinates'
 and fermionic 'momenta'  by relations
^Z = 1 2 ^Z  ^Z,
^Z   =
1 2 ^Z^Z  , ^Z =
1 2  (^3+i ^4),^Z   = ^Z* , which satisfy the desired
commutation relations ^Z ,^Z  
=1 8 (^+^Z   ^Z)^ ,
^Z ,^Z =0, ^Z  ,^Z  =0. Accordingly the fields of SYM are also decomposed into multiplets
of R-symmetry  algebra. The six scalar fields
 are decomposed into four scalar fields 
transforming in vector representation of the  algebra and
two complex fields ,  defined by Z 1 2  (^3+i ^4), Z 1 2  (^3 - i ^4), while the fermionic field  is decomposed as follows
^= ^Z +^Z  ,^Z 1 2 ^Z  ^Z ^,
^Z   1 2 ^Z
^Z   ^ . Light-cone gauge  SYM in plane wave background
can be formulated in
light-cone superspace which
is based on space-time coordinates , 
and Grassmann coordinates 
( are  vector indices;
 are
 transverse indices;  are space-time symmetry
 transverse
indices;  are R-symmetry  indices;
 are R-symmetry  indices; indices
 are collection of space-time 
indices  and R-symmetry  indices .
Coordinates in light-cone directions are defined by
. Remaining transverse coordinates
 are decomposed into , ,  where
.
The scalar product of two   vectors is decomposed then as
.) .
In this light-cone superspace we introduce scalar
superfield . Instead of position space it is
convenient
to use momentum space for all coordinates except the light-cone time  .
This implies using momenta , ,
, instead of positions , , 
respectively.
Thus we consider the scalar superfield
 with the
following expansion in powers of Grassmann momentum 
 
The fact that the fields ,  are subject
to the hermitian conjugation rules given in fieherrul 
can be expressed in terms of the superfield by the following relation
(-p,) = (p^+)^2d^4^Z   e^2^-  ^/p^+ 
(p,)^.
In terms of the superfield  the action
of  SYM takes then the form S = S_2 +S_3 +S_4, where the free action  and cubic action  are fixed to
be(Because the expression for  is not illuminating
we do not present it here.) 
 
The expression for the particle Hamiltonian  which enters the
free action is given in pppm , while the integration measure
in cubic action is given by
d_3  = 1 (2)^3/2  
^(3) (_a=1 ^3p_a)
(_a=1 ^3_a^Z  )
_a=1 ^3 d^3p_a
d^4_a^Z  .
The quantities ,  are defined by
pgen 
P ^1 3  _a=1 ^3 p_a^(p_a+1 ^+-p^+_a+2 ),
^Z  
 1 3 _a=1 ^3 ^Z  _a(p^+_a+1 -p^+_a+2 ),
so that they are manifestly symmetric under cyclical permutations
of particle labels 1,2,3. Taking into  account the momenta conservation
laws we obtain the relations
P ^= P _12 ^P _23 ^P _31 ^,
^Z  
 = _12 ^Z  =_23 ^Z  =_31 ^Z  ,
where
P _ab ^p_a^p_b^+ - p_b^p_a^+,
_ab ^Z  ^Z  _a p_b^+
- _b^Z   p_a^+.
The superfield form of the action s2sup ,s3sup 
was obtained by direct
comparison with the action taken in terms of component fields
kinpw ,lag3 .

In the Hamiltonian approach the physical fields satisfy the
canonical (anti)commutation relations
[A^I(p)^a ,A^J(p')^a' ]_equal x^+ 
=1 2p^+ ^IJ ^(3) (p+p')I  ^a a' ,
^Z (p)^a ,
^Z  (p')^a' _equal x^+ 
=-1 4 (^-^Z  ^Z)^ 
^(3) (p+p')I  ^a a' ,
where  is a projector
operator which we insert to respect the Lie algebra indices of the
physical fields  and
. All that is required this
operator should satisfy the relation

. Taking into account the expression for
-function over anti-commuting variables delfun 
the above-given canonical commutation relations
can be collected into the superfield form
[(p,^Z  )^a ,
(p ',^Z   ')^a' ]_equal x^+ 
=1 2p^+ ^(3) (p+p')(^Z  
+^Z   ')I  ^a a' .
Superfield realization of
superconformal symmetries of  plane wave SYM
 
In this section we discuss realization of global
superconformal supersymmetries of  SYM
in plane wave background.
As is well known these symmetries are generated by
the  superalgebra.
The realization of these symmetries on the component fields of  SYM
was obtained in. Here we
develop a superfield realization of
these symmetries.
To do that we use the
framework of Noether charges. The Noether charges play an
important role in analysis of the symmetries of dynamical systems.
The choice of the light cone gauge spoils manifest global
symmetries,  and  in order to demonstrate that these global
invariances are still present, one needs to  find the Noether
charges that generate them.

The component
form of the Noether charges for  SYM was obtained in
.
Superfield representation for the
Noether charges can be derived by direct comparison
with the Noether charges taken in the component form.
Doing this we obtain the following representation for the
Noether charges 
G_f.t.  = d^4^Z  
d^3p p^+ (-p,-^Z  )G
(p,^Z  ),
where  denotes representation of generators of the
 superalgebra in terms of differential operators
acting on the superfield .
These differential operators are listed below.

Generators of the isometry symmetries :
 
where we use notation , 
.
These generators satisfy commutation relations of the
isometry symmetries algebra of  plane wave background
(see Appendix C).

Proper conformal generators :
 
Generators of the isometry symmetries and proper conformal symmetries
form commutation relations of the  algebra taken to be in
the plane wave basis.

Generators of R-symmetries so(6) algebra :
 
The hermitian properties of these generators are fixed to be

,
, 
.

Supercharges :
 
S^- = 2(D-1)(^Z+1 p^+ ^Z  )
+(l^ +2M^ )
^ (^Z + 1 p^+ ^Z  ).
The hermitian properties of the supercharges are fixed to be
, ,
.

Transformations of fields defined by
 take
then the form
_G = G.
Oscillator realization of superconformal 

symmetries 

The expressions for generators above-given are defined in terms of
differential operators acting on wave function taken to be in momentum
space. The representation for generators can be simplified by passing to
the oscillators representation of wave function.

Let  be square integrable solution to free equations
of motion for fields of plane wave  SYM corresponding to
the , (dependence on  is implicit)
equmot0  i _x^+  =- P^-,p^+>0. Transformation of this wave function from momentum
space to the oscillator basis wave function denoted by
 is fixed to be (a,p^+)=
d^2p e^F (p,p^+)0, F -1 2p^+ p^p^+2 p^+   a^p^-1 2  a^a^, , where  is
creation operator and  is the Fock space vacuum defined
by , .
These formulas imply the following realization of operators
 and  app  a^=
1 2p^+   (p^- p^+_p^ ),
a ^= 1 2p^+  ( p^+ p^+_p^ ). Making use of these relation it is
easy to see that the solution to the equation equmot0  can be
presented in the following elegant form (a,p^+)=
_n=0 ^e^-i (n+1)x^+  a^_1 a^_n 
^_1_n (p^+)0. Taking into account
a realization of the differential operator  on the
oscillator wave function  (_p^+  +1 4p^+ (a^a^-a ^a ^-2))(a,p^+)= d^2p e^F
_p^+ (p,p^+) and the formulas app  it is easy
to transform the generators to the oscillator basis. For the
generators of the isometry symmetries we get the representation
 

Oscillator representation for generators of the proper conformal
transformations takes the form
 
The oscillator representation for the supercharges is obtainable
by inserting the above-given expressions for bosonic generators
into formulas omp -smin . Because of certain attractive
features it seems that the oscillators representation is fruitful
direction to go. Interesting discussion of application of the
oscillator construction to the plane wave physics
may be found in(Realization
of conformal and Heisenberg algebras in plane wave CFT
correspondence may be found in.) .

Appendix A: Lagrangian of plane wave  SYM
in terms of component fields on space-time .
Light cone gauge fixed Lagrangian can be presented as follows
L = L _2+L _3+L _4, where 
 describes quadratic part of Lagrangian while 
and  describe 3-point and 4-point interaction vertices
respectively. The quadratic part  is given by
kinpw  L _2 = 1 2 A^IA^I
-i 4 ^ ^+ ^+ ^, where the standard covariant D'Alembertian operator in
 plane wave background
4dpw  ds^2 = 2dx^+ dx^- -^2 x^x^dx^+dx^+ +
dx^dx^, is given by
box  = 2_x^+ _x^-  +
_x^ _x^ 
+ ^2 x^x^_x^- _x^- . The
3-point and 4-point interaction vertices are given by
 
The physical fields ,  being Lie algebra valued
in the adjoint representation of gauge group are assumed to be
anti-hermitian ,
.
The  denotes minus trace 
. All fields are assumed to be independent
of six coordinates : ,
.

Appendix B: Component form of the action of  SYM in
terms of momentum modes . Because a formulation of action in terms of
momentum modes of fields is more convenient in
superfield approach we make the Fouirer transformation
(x) = i d^3p (2)^3/2  
e^i(p^+x^- +x^p^) (x^+,p),
d^3p dp^1 dp^2 dp^+,
so that the Fouirer modes satisfy the hermitian conjugation rules
fieherrul 
A^I(x^+,p)^= A^I(x^+,-p),
^(x^+,p)^= ^(x^+,-p).
In terms of momentum modes the quadratic and the cubic parts of
the action kinpw ,lag3  take the form
 
where the momentum  is defined in pgen ,
while the measure  is given by
d_3(p)  = 1 (2)^3/2  
^(3) (_a=1 ^3p_a)
_a=1 ^3 d^3p_a.
In these formulas we
keep dependence on six coordinates . To get expressions
corresponding to  SYM one needs to apply rule .



Appendix C: Commutation relations of the 
superalgebra in plane wave basis . These commutation relations
for anti-hermitian bosonic generators were worked out in
. In this paper we use the basis in which some of
the generators have different hermitian properties. This is to say that
,  are taken to be hermitian, while the hermitian properties of
the remaining generators are fixed to be
, ,
,
,
(Denoting by 
the bosonic anti-hermitian generators used in
 we have the following relations:
, ,
,
,
,
, ,
,
,
. Here we use the same supercharges  as in
,
while  is multiplied by factor .) .



In plane wave basis all
generators, by definition, are eigenvectors of  and .
Therefore given generator
 we introduce  and  charges which are
defined by commutators
pdcha  [P^-, G] = -q_G(P^-)G, [D,G] =
q_G(D)G. These charges for generators of the 
superalgebra are given in Table.


 
 
Note that the -charges of the generators  and
 are equal to zero. Remaining (anti)commutators can be
collected in several groups.

Commutators between elements of isometry algebra are
pwcomrel1  [T ^,T^]=2^ 
P^+,[T^,J^ ]=^ T^-^ T^.Commutators between proper conformal generators are given by
pwcomrel2  [C ^,C^]=2^ K^-,
[C ,C]=-4P^-,
[C ^i,C]=2C^i. Commutators between generators of isometry algebra and proper
conformal generators take the form pwcomrel3 
[P^+,K^-]=D, [P^+,C^]= T^, [T^,K^-]=C^, pwcomrel4 
[T^,C^]=^ C, [T^,C ]= -2
T ^, pwcomrel5  [C ^,T^] =
^ (P^- + D) + 2J^ . Commutators between isometry algebra and supercharges are
[T^,  ^-] = ^+ ^+, [T^,S^-]=^^-, [P^+,S^-] =
 ^+
^+, 





Commutators between proper conformal generators and supercharges
are [K^-,^+] = -1 2 ^- S^-, [C^,^+] = -1 2 ^-i  ^-, [C^, ^-] = -^S^-, [C, ^-] = -2 ^-. Commutators of  algebra
and commutators between generators of the  and supercharges
in plane wave basis take the standard form.

Anticommutators between supercharges are ^+,^+=2 ^-P^+,^-,^-=-2 ^+C,
S^-,S^-=4^+K^-,
 ^-,^-= 2^+ P^-
+^+ J^  - ^+MN J^MN ,
^-,^+ =
^+^-^T^, ^-,S^- = - 2 ^+  C^, S^-,^+ =^+ ^-D +1
 2 ^+ ^-^ J^  - 1
 2 ^+ ^-^MN J^MN . Modulo
(anti)commutators obtainable from the ones above-given by applying
hermitian conjugation, the remaining (anti)commutators are equal
to zero.

Appendix D: Fierz identities . Often we use the
following identities for
-matrices( are so(3,1) indices;
 are R-symmetry so(6) indices;
 are spinor  indices. We use
convention for  matrices following Ref..) 
basfieide 
 ^_( ^_) =0,

^_^_ =1 48 (^ )^ 
(^ )_ , unf 
^_^_-1 2 (^mn )^ _(^mn )^ _+1 2 (^MN )^ _(^MN )^ _+()
=2^m_ (^m)^ .
The identities basfieide  are well known, while
the identity unf  is derivable from the 1st identity in basfieide .
From the 2nd identity basfieide  we can get the following
'generating' identity
basfie 
8^-^Z  ^Z^-=
^-Z I  ^Z^-ZI  ^Z.
Inserting in basfie 
,

and , 
we get the following respective identities


fieide11  ^Z^-ZI  ^Z
^Z^-ZJ  ^Z =
1 6 ^I J  
^Z^-ZK  ^Z
^Z^-ZK  ^Z, ^Z^-Zi' ^Z ^Z^Z^Z  = -1 6 ^Z^-ZI  ^Z
^Z^I  ^Zi' ^Z . Multiplying the identity unf  by ,  and
then by ,  gives the identity (^^Z)_(^^Z)_=-1 8 (^+Z i' )_ 
^Z^-Zi' ^Z. Appendix E: Integrals over anti-commuting variables . The
measure  is normalized to be basint  d^4^Z ^Z  ^Z ^Z ^Z  
=1 64 (^+Z I  )^ 
(^+Z I  )^ . Note that the
l.h.s. of this formula is antisymmetric in spinor indices
, , , . Making use of the 1st
identity basfieide  one can make sure that the r.h.s is also
antisymmetric in , , , . The fact
that the integral basint  can be cast into the form
above-given can be proved by using identity ^Z 
^Z  =
1 16 (^+Z I  )^ 
^Z^-ZI  ^Z, and identity
fieide11 . All remaining integrals are derivable from the
basic integral basint  in a straightforward way:
 
Taking these relations into account the expression for
-function is fixed to be

The superfield light cone gauge formulation of  SYM in

superconformal symmetries in terms of a light cone superfield. An
oscillator realization of superconformal symmetries is also
obtained.
