Smooth-throat wormholes are treated on as possessing quantum
fluctuation energy with scalar massive field as its source. Heat
kernel coefficients of the Laplace operator are calculated  in
background of the arbitrary-profile throat wormhole with the help
of the zeta-function approach. Two specific profile are
considered. Some arguments are given that the wormholes may exist.
It serves as a solution of semiclassical Einstein equations in the
range of specific values of length and certain radius of
wormhole's throat and constant of non-minimal connection.

Introduction 

Great interest towards the space-time of wormholes dates back
at least to 1916. Subsequent activity was initiated by
both classical works of Einstein and Rosen in 1935 in the
context of black hole space-time structure and the later series of
works by Wheeler in 1955 with his excellent idea to
create everything from nothing. The more recent interest in the
topic of wormholes has been rekindled by the works of Morris and
Thorne and Morris, Thorne, and Yurtsever
 who made use of the concept of wormhole in scientific
discussion of "time machine". These authors constructed and
investigated a class of objects they referred to as "traversable
wormholes". Their work led to a flurry of activity in wormhole
physics.

It is well-known that the central problem of the traversable
wormholes connects with unavoidable violations of the null energy
condition. It means that the matter which should be a source of
this object has to possess some exotic properties. For this
reason the traversable wormhole can not be represented as a
self-consistent solution of Einstein equations with usual
classical matter as a source because usual matter is sure to
satisfy all energy conditions. One way out is to use quantum fields
in frameworks of semi-classical quantum gravity. The point is that
the vacuum average value of energy-momentum tensor of quantum
fluctuations may violate energy conditions. A self-consistent
wormholes in framework the semiclassical quantum gravity have been
studied in Ref.. In our recent paperwe have considered a possibility for self-consistent solution of
semi-classical Einstein equations for specific kind of wormhole -
short-throat flat-space wormhole. The model represents two
identical copies of Minkowski space with spherical regions excised
from each copy, and with boundaries of these regions to be
identified. The space-time of this model is flat everywhere except
a two-dimensional singular spherical surface. The vacuum average
of energy of quantum fluctuations of massive scalar field with
non-minimal connection serves as a source for this space-time. Due
to the fact that this space-time is flat everywhere a complete set
of wave modes of the massive scalar field can be constructed and
ground state energy can be calculated. In the paper we present a
calculation of full energy of quantum fluctuations rather then
energy density and use the Einstein's equations with quantum source only,
without classical contribution. We found that the energy of
fluctuations as a function of radius of throat  may possess a
minimum  if the non-minimal connection constant .
Utilization of the Einstein equations at the minimum gives the stable configurations
of the wormhole. For instance, in the case of conformal
connection, , we found relation between the radius 
of wormhole and mass  of the scalar field: .
The Einstein equations say that the wormhole has a radius of throat
 and the mass of scalar field 
. Therefore, this kind of wormhole, if it exists, may
possess sub-Planckian radius of throat and it may be created by a
massive scalar field with supper-Planckian mass. Obviously, the
validity of the results obtained are restricted by the model taken  -
short-throat flat-space wormhole.

The goal of this paper is to consider the wormholes with more real
geometry of throat and energy of quantum fluctuations of massive
scalar field as a source of this background. The main problem in
this case has rather mathematical character. Even for simple
profile of throat it becomes impossible to obtain a full set of
solutions of radial equation in order to find the energy density
of quantum fluctuations in close form. Nevertheless, it is
possible to make some predictions about the existence of the
wormholes by considering the heat kernel coefficients
. In fact, the crucial point is the existence of
the negative minimum of the zero point energy. The sufficient
condition for the zero point energy to have negative minimum is
that the heat kernel coefficients  and  be positive
. This gives a condition for parameters of model.
More precisely, if a background is described by a parameter 
with dimension of length and the domain where the space-time is
"mainly" curved is defined by this parameter, then for small
size of curved domain, , the zero point energy shows
the following behavior
E^ren  -B_2 (m)^2 32^2 ,
and in opposite limit  we have
E^ren  -B_3 32^2 m^2 .
If both these conditions are satisfied one can expect that the
system will stay in minimum of energy which is characterized by
specific values of parameters of wormhole and constant of
non-minimal connection . Next step is the
utilization of the Einstein's equations with energy-momentum
tensor of quantum fluctuations as a source. Integration over volume
the  component of this equation gives an additional relation
between parameters of wormhole and zero point energy by using which
we obtain the size of wormhole and mass of scalar field in terms of
the Planck length and Planck mass correspondingly. At the
beginning we may expect that the size of wormhole
and mass of field will be in the Planck scale. For this reason we
are interested only in finding of the domain of the wormhole's parameters
and constant non-minimal connection  for different models of
the wormhole's profile.

The manifest expression for coefficient  exists for arbitrary
background, but this is not the case for coefficient . For
this reason we adopt here the zeta-regularization approach (see
Sec. ), in frame of which it is possible to
calculate the heat kernel coefficients and zero point energy
itself. We pursue here another goal - to evolve the zeta-function
approach for situations where it is impossible to find
the full set of solutions of radial equation in closed form.
We find a method to calculate the heat kernel coefficients in the
background of wormhole with arbitrary profile of throat by using the WKB
approach. Moreover, we obtain expressions for arbitrary heat
kernel coefficients and we reproduce them in manifest form up to
 for arbitrary profile of wormhole's throat.

The organization of the paper is as follows. In Sec. we consider the geometry of wormhole with smooth throat. In Sec.
 we discuss the method of zeta-function for
calculation of zero-point energy. The WKB approach for scalar
massive field is considered in Sec.. The heat kernel
coefficients are obtained in Sec.. We calculate them in
manifest form for arbitrary profile of throat. The specific
profiles of throat are investigated in Sec. and
. In Sec. we discuss the results obtained.
Appendix A contains some technical formulas which are rather
complicated to reproduce them in the text.

We use units . The signature of the space-time,
the sign of the Riemann and Ricci tensors, are the same as in the
book by Hawking and Ellis.


A traversable wormhole with smooth throat 
The metric of space-time of wormhole which is under consideration
has the form below
Metric 
ds^2 = -dt^2 + d^2 + r^2()( d^2 + ^2d^2).
The radial variable  changes from  to . In
the paper we restrict ourself by wormholes with symmetric throat
which means that . The radius  of throat
is defined as follows . We suppose that far from the
wormhole's throat the space-time becomes Minkowskian, that is
_  r^2() ^2  = 1.
The non-zero components of the Ricci tensor and scalar curvature
have the following form
R ^_&=& -2r" r , 

R ^_= R ^_&=& --1+r'^2 + r r" r^2 ,

R  &=& -2(-1+r'^2 + 2r r") r^2 .
The energy-momentum tensor corresponding to this metric has
diagonal form from which we observe that the source of this metric
possesses the following energy density and pressure:
&=& --1 + r'^2 + 2rr" 8r^2 ,


p_&=&-1 + r'^2 8r^2 ,


p_&=& p_= r" 8r .

In the paper we obtain general formulas for space-time
Metric  with arbitrary symmetric function  obeying
above Minkowskian condition. Two specific kinds of throat's
profile will be considered. In the first model the profile of
throat has the following form:
First 
r() = ^2 + a^2 ,
where  is radius of throat which characterizes wormhole's size.
The embedding into the three dimensional Euclidean space of the
section of the space-time by surface  is
plotted in Fig.(I) for two different values of radius
of throat. In Euclidean space with cylindrical coordinates
 this surface may be found in parametric form from
relations: . In this
background there is the only nonzero component of the Ricci tensor
which reads
R ^_= -2 a^2 (^2 + a^2)^2 .
 
 
fig1_I.eps 
fig1_II.eps 
fig1_III.eps 
fig1_IV.eps 
 First figure (I) represents the section
 of wormhole's space-time with profile
function  for two different values of
radius of the throat. Three next figures illustrate the wormhole
with profile of throat 
. Figure (II) and (III) illustrate that the  and  are
radius and length of throat, accordingly. In last figure two
wormholes with different  but with the same ratio radius and
length of throat are depicted. It is seen that the parameter 
characterizes the "size" of wormhole and  describes the
"form" of wormhole.  
The second model has been considered in Ref. and it is
characterized by the following profile of throat
Second 
r() = () - + a.
This model possesses a more reach structure. There are two parameters
 and . The latter parameter is radius of throat. In this
model we may introduce another parameter which may be called
length of the throat. The point is that the function 
turns into linear function of  starting from distance 
 and the space-time becomes approximately Minkowskian. Therefore,
the length of throat . Using new variables 
 one rewrites the function  in the form below
r(y) =a(y(y) - + 1).
The parameter  is the ratio of the length and radius of
throat. This parameter will play the main role in our analysis. It
allows us to consider wormholes of different form, that is with
different ratio of the radius and length of throat.

In Fig.(II-IV) the sections  of
this wormhole space-time are shown for different values of  and
. Namely in Fig.(II) we represent two wormholes
with the same radius of throat but with different length, and vice
versa in Fig.(II) we depict two wormholes with the same
length of throat but with different radii of throat. In last
picture Fig.(IV) two wormholes with the same ratio of
length and radius of throat, but with different values of throats'
radii are depicted. Therefore the size of wormhole with the same
ratio of length and radius throat is managed by parameter . The
parameter  describes wormhole's form.


Zero point energy: zeta-function approach  

We exploit the zeta function regularization approach
 developed in Ref.and calculate the zero point energy of massive scalar field
in this background with consequent using the Einstein equations.
Let us repeat some main formulas from those papers. In framework
of this approach the zero point energy
E(s)=12 ^2s 
_j _(n) (_(n),j ^2+m^2 )^1/2-s  =  12
^2s  _L  (s-12),
of scalar massive field  is expressed in terms of the
zeta-function
_L  (s-12) =
_j _(n) (_(n),j ^2 + m^2 )^1/2-s 
of the Laplace operator 
. Here   is the
three dimensional operator. The eigenvalues
 of operator  are found from
boundary condition which looks as follows
_(n) (, R) = 0,
where  denotes some boundary parameter. The solutions 
 of this equation depend on the numbers ,
and additionally they have the index , which
numerates  the solutions of the boundary equation. Therefore, the
zeta-function is a sum of expressions which depend on zeros of
function . Next, according to Ref. we
convert the series over  in zeta function to integral and
arrive to the formula
MainFormulaEnergy 
E(s) = - 12 ^2s  _(n)  s  
_m^d k(k^2 - m^2)^1/2 - s  k 
_(n)  (ik, R),
where the function   in imaginary axes appears.

The expression MainFormulaEnergy  is divergent in the limit
 we are interested in. For renormalization we
subtract from   all terms  which will survive in
the limit :
E^div (s) = _m E(s)
and define the renormalized energy as follows:
ErenDef 
E^ren  = _s0  (E(s) - E^div (s)).
Because the pole structure of zeta-function does not depend on the
value of parameters, it is obvious that in the limit 
the divergent part will have the structure of DeWitt-Schwinger
expansion, which has the following form
ehk 
E^div  (s) &=& 12(m)^2s  1(4)^3/2  (s - 12)  

&&  B_0 m^4(s-2) + B_1/2 m^3(s-32)
+ B_1 m^2 (s-1) + B_3/2  m (s-12) + B_2 (s) , where  are the heat kernel coefficients. In order to
extract the divergent part of the energy we use the following
procedure. We subtract from and add to integrand the
uniform expansion of  up to . We denote this expansion as
. Therefore, according to this, we
represent the energy as the sum
Division 
E(s) = E_fin (s) + E_as (s)
of finite (in the limit ) part
E_fin (s) &=& - 12 ^2s  _(n)  s   _m^d k(k^2 - m^2)^1/2 - s 

&&k  (_(n)  (ik, R) -
(_(n) (ik, R))^as ),
and the remains, which will be obtained from the uniform expansion
part
E_as (s) = - 12 ^2s  _(n)  s  
_m^d k(k^2 - m^2)^1/2 - s  k 
(_(n) (ik, R))^as .
The last expression contains all terms which will survive in the
limit .

Taking into account the obtained expressions in Eq. ErenDef 
we arrive at the formula
GenForm 
E^ren  = E_fin  + E_as ^fin ,
where
E_fin  &=& E_fin (0) = - 12 
_(n)  _m^d kk^2 - m^2 

&&k  (_(n)  (ik,
R) - (_(n) (ik, R))^as ), 

E_as ^fin  &=& _s0 (E_as (s) - E^div (s)).
The divergent part  is given by Eq. ehk .

The finite part  is calculated numerically. The second
part, in practice, is found in the following way. By using the
uniform expansion  we calculate in manifest
form the  and after that we take the limit 
 in the expression obtained (the pole structure does not
change). All terms which will survive in this limit constitute the
DeWitt-Schwinger expansion  ehk  which we have to subtract in
Eq. Easfin . This way of calculation is more preferable
because we may obtain the heat kernel coefficients in manifest
form. The calculations of heat kernel coefficients in framework of
this approach shows that the approach is suitable for both smooth
background and for manifolds with singular surfaces codimension
one and two, the general formulas
for which were obtained in Refs. and
.

From consideration above we may find the zero-point
energy for large and small size of wormhole. Let
the parameter  characterize the size of wormhole. In this case
the  is a dimensionless function and it depends on the
parameter  and some additional dimensionless parameters which
characterize the form of wormhole. For example, in first model
First  there is the only parameter  which is the radius of
wormhole's throat and it characterizes at the same time the size
of wormhole as a whole. Therefore in this model the 
depends on  and there are no additional parameters. In the
second model Second  there is an additional parameter 
 except parameter . For this reason the dependence of
the zero point energy  on the mass is the same as
parameter . Because for renormalization we subtracted all terms
of asymptotic over mass expansion up to  the asymptotic 
 is the following
Large 
E^ren  m  -B_3 32^2 m^3  = -b_3 32^2
(ma)^3 .
In opposite case, , the behavior of energy is defined by
coefficient  (see also Eq. LogTerms ):
Small 
E^ren  m  -(ma)^2 32^2 m  B_2 =
-(ma)^2 32^2 (ma)  b_2.
Here  and  are dimensionless heat kernel coefficients
which may depend on the additional parameters. Therefore from
these expressions we obtain the following sufficient condition that
the zero point energy has a minimum: both  and  have to be
positive. An additional condition may be obtained from Einstein's
equations (see Sec.,).


Massive scalar field in wormholes background: the WKB
approach 

We consider massive scalar quantum field in this backgrounds as a
source for this space-time. In the frameworks of the approach used one
has to find the spectrum of Laplace operator :
(- + R )= .
Taking into account the spherical symmetry of problem we represent
equation in the following form
= Y_l^m(,) where  are the spherical harmonics, 
 and . The radial part of the wave
function subjects for equation
RadEqu 
(^2_+ 2r' r
_- l(l+1) r^2   - R )=
-^2 .
To find the spectrum  we have to impose some appropriate
boundary condition. It does not matter which kind of boundary
condition will impose because in the end of calculation we will
tend this boundary to infinity. We use the Dirichlet boundary
condition in the spheres with radii : . For
simplifying formulas we will work here with function 
. With this notations the
regularized ground state energy reads
E(s) = 12 (m)^2s  (s-12).
Because we need the solution for the imaginary energy only (see
Eq. MainFormulaEnergy ), we change the integrand variable
in radial equation RadEqu  to imaginary axis: 
 and rescale for simplicity the radial variable: 
. Therefore we arrive at the following equation 

  + 2     - ^2 (1 + 1^2 ) + (14^2  - R _k)= 0,
where the dot is the derivative with respect to ; 
, and .

A general solution of radial equation RadEquDimless  is the
superposition of two linearly independent solutions
 (i k,x) = C_1 _1(x) + C_2 _2(x).
The first function  tends to infinity far from throat, for
, and the second one tends to zero. We consider
the behavior of functions only for one part of space-time namely,
with . The behavior of the solutions in the second part
of space-time with negative  is found as continuation of the
solutions from positive part of space-time. Now we impose the
Dirichlet boundary condition at spheres :
 (i k, +R) = C_1 _1(+R) + C_2 _2(+R)=0, 

 (i k, -R) = C_1 _1(-R) + C_2 _2(-R)=0.
The solution of this system exists if and only if the following
condition is satisfied
_l(i k,R) = _1(+R) _2(-R) - _1(-R) _2(+R)
= 0. The contribution from the second term in equation above  is
exponentially small comparing with first one in the limit 
. In order to see this let us find the uniform expansion of
solutions  and . Moreover, we need this
expansion for renormalization and calculation of the heat kernel
coefficients. Let us represent a solution  in the
exponential form
(x) =12a   e^S(x)  where , and substitute it in the radial equation
RadEquDimless . One obtains a non-linear equation
S  + S ^2 + 2   S  - ^2 (1 +
1^2 ) + (14^2  - R _k) = 0.
We represent now the solution in the WKB expansion form
S= _n=-1 ^^-n  S_n,
and substitute it in equation above. This gives the following
chain of equations
System 
S _-1  &=& 1 + 1^2  , 

S _0 &=& -12 S _-1  S _-1   -    , 

S _1 &=& -12S _-1   [S _0 +
S _0^2 +
2  S _0 + 14^2  - R _k], 

S _n+1  &=& -12S _-1   [S _n +
_k=0 ^n S _k S _n-k  + 2  S _n], n=1,2,.
There are two solutions of this chain corresponding to sign in the
first equation. The sign plus gives the growing (for positive
coordinate ) solution which we mark "" and sign minus
gives solution which tends to zero at infinity which we mark by
sign "". Therefore
_1(+R) _2(-R) =12a  e^S^+(+R)+S^-(-R) .
To find an expansion for the sum  we need the
following properties of function 
S ^- _2n-1 (x) &=& -S ^+ _2n-1 (x),

S ^- _2n (x) &=& + S ^+ _2n (x),
and
S ^_2n-1 (x) &=& +S ^_2n-1 (-x),

S ^_2n (x) &=& -S ^_2n (-x),
where  . The first two equations are the consequence
of the structure of chain and the last two equations are due to
the symmetry of metric function .

Taking into account these properties of symmetry we have
S^+(+x)+S^-(-x) &=& _n=0 ^^1-2n  [ C_2n -
1 ^+ + C_2n - 1 ^-   + _-x ^+x  S ^+_2n-1  dx ]

&+& _n=0 ^^-2n  [ C_2n ^+ +
C_2n ^- +2 _x_0 ^+x S ^+_2n  dx ], 

S^+(+x)+S^-(+x) &=& _n=0 ^^1-2n  [ C_2n -
1 ^+ + C_2n - 1 ^- ]

&+& _n=0 ^^-2n  [ C_2n ^+ + C_2n ^- +2
_x_0 ^+x S ^+_2n  dx ], Here the  are the constant of integration of system
System .

Therefore we may express the combination we need S+-  in term of the
S++ :
S^+(+x)+S^-(-x) = S^+(+x)+S^-(+x) + _n=0 ^^1-2n _-x ^+x  S ^+_2n-1  dx
To find the combination  we use the Wronskian
condition. Because these solutions are independent, they obey
to equation ()
W(_1(x),_2(x)) = k ^2 .
The origin of this relation is the following. Suppose we try to
find the scalar Green function of the Klein-Gordon equation:
(g^  __- m^2 - R )
G(x,x') = ^4(x,x') -g(x)   in background Metric . It is very easy to extract time and
angular dependence of the Green function
G(x,x')= _- ^+  d 2 
_l=0 ^_m=-l ^l Y_l^m(,)
Y_l^-m (e^-i(t-t') (,and we arrive to equation for radial part of Green function which
reads 
^2_+ 2r' r _+ ^2 -
l(l+1) r^2   - R (,= (- r^2 
or in dimensionless variables ()
^2_x + 2   _x - ^2 (1 +
1^2 ) + (14^2  - R _k)(x,x') = k(x - x) ^2 .
As usual we represent the radial Green function in standard form:
(x,x') = (x'-x) _1(x) _2(x') + (x-x')
_2(x) _1(x'),
where  and  are two linearly independent solutions
of homogenous equation and  tends to infinity for 
 and  tends to . The Wronskian condition appears
if we substitute this form of radial Green function to radial
equation above:
W (_1(x),_2(x')) = k ^2 .
Therefore, if two functions  and  describe the
system, they have to obey this Wronskian condition.

For solution in exponential form ExpFor  this condition gives
e^S^+(x) + S^-(x)  = 2 ^2  1S ^+(x) -
S ^-(x) .
The denominator in rhs has the following form
S ^+(x) - S ^-(x) = 2_n=0 ^^1-2n 
S ^+_2n-1 .
Taking into account these two  expressions above we arrive at the
formula
ME 
S^+(x) + S^-(-x) = () - 12 (S ^2_-1  ^4)
+ _n=0 ^^1-2n _-x ^+x S ^+_2n-1 dx -
1 + _n=1 ^^-2n S ^+_2n-1  S ^+_-1  .
The main achievements and peculiarities of this expression are:
(i) the rhs is expressed in terms of derivative of functions
, we do not need to find the constants of integration in
the chain of equations System , (ii) the odd and even power
of  are separated, which leads to separation of the contribution to
heat kernel coefficients with integer and half-integer indices,
(iii) the rhs is expressed in terms of functions  with odd
indices, only. The first three functions  are
listed in Appendix , formula SeriesS . We would like
to note that this formula is valid for arbitrary, but symmetric,
, metric coefficient.

From this expression we may conclude that the contribution from
the second term in condition MainCond  is exponentially small
comparing with first one. Indeed, the main WKB term in Eq.
ME  gives the following contribution:
_1(+R)_2(-R) k 2 1S ^+_-1 
^2 +_-kR ^+kR S ^+_-
1 dx, 

_1(-R)_2(+R) k 2 1S ^+_-1 
^2 -_-kR ^+kR S ^+_- 1 dx.
Because the function  is positive for arbitrary
 we observe that the second expression gives exponentially
small (for ) contribution comparing with first one
and we will omit it in what follows.


Heat kernel coefficients 

Let us now proceed to evaluation of the heat kernel coefficients
(HKC). The formula ME  allows us to find HKC in general form
for arbitrary indices. Taking into account above discussions we
have the following expression for zeta- function
(s - 12) = - m^2s 2s _l=0 ^^2-2s  _m ^dk (k^2 - m^2 ^2 )^1/2 -s   k  S^+(+R) +
S^-(-R).
To find the heat kernel coefficients we use the uniform expansion
given by Eq. ME . As it will be clear later, the odd powers
of  will give contribution to HKC with integer indices and
even powers of  produce the contribution to HKC with
half-integer indices. The well-known asymptotic expansion of
zeta-function in three dimensions has the form below
Zeta3Dim 
_as  (s-12) = 1 (4)^3/2  1(s-12)  _l=0 ^ m^4-2l  B_l (s+l-2) +
m^3-2l  B_l+1/2  (s+l-32).
For simplicity we introduce the density of HKC with integer
indices  by relation
B_l = _-R ^+R  dB _l()
and first of all we will obtain formulas for this density.

Let us consider the part of Eq. ME  with odd degree of .
The contribution to zeta-function is the following:
^odd _as (s - 12) = - m^2s 2s _l=0 ^^2-2s  _m ^dk (k^2 - m^2 ^2 )^1/2 -s   k   
_p=0 ^^1-2p _-kR ^+kR S ^+_2p-1 (x)dx
.
We change now the variable of integration  and take the
derivative with respect to :
^odd _as (s - 12) = - m^2s 2s _l=0 ^^2-2s  _m ^dk k (k^2 -
m^2 ^2 )^1/2 -s   _p=0 ^^1-2p _-R ^+R s_2p-1 (k,)d.
The first four functions  are listed in Appendix
, formula Sodd . The general structure of these
functions is the following
s_2p-1  = _n=0 ^2p  _2p-1,n  z^-p-n-12 ,
where  are the functions of , and 
.

Next, we integrate over  using the formula
_ma ^dk k (k^2 - m^2 ^2 )^12 -s 
(1+k^2r^2)^-q  = 12 r^2s-3 ^-3+2s+2q  (^2 +
m^2r^2)^32 -s -q  (32- s)(q-32+s) (q) 
and obtain the following expression for odd part of the zeta
function
ZetaOdd 
^odd _as (s - 12) = m^2s  (s - 12) 
_-R ^+R  d_l=0 ^_p=0 ^_n=0 ^2p  _2p-1,n  r^2s-3  (s+p+n-1) (p+n+12)  ^2n+1  (^2 +
m^2r^2)^s+p+n- 1  .
By using the binomial of Newton we reduce the power of  in
nominator
Binom 
_l=0 ^^2n+1  (^2 + m^2r^2)^s+p+n-1   =
12 _q=0 ^n (-m^2r^2)^n-q  n! q!(n-q)!  Z  (s+p+n-1-q) (s+p+n-1-q) ,
where
Z (s) = 2(s) _l=0 ^(^2 +
m^2r^2)^s .
To obtain the HKC we need asymptotic (over mass ) expansion
of the zeta-function. The asymptotic expansion of function 
 was obtained in the Ref. and it has the
form below
Z 
Z (s) &=& (mr)^-2s  _l=-1 ^A_l(s) (mr)^-2l ,

A_-1 (s) &=& (s-1),

A_l(s) &=& 2 (-1)^l l!  (l+s) _H (-1 - 2l,12),
where the  is the Hurwitz zeta-function.

Taking into account formulas Binom  and Z  one has the following
asymptotic series for odd part of zeta-function
^odd _as (s - 12) &=& 1 2(s-12) _-R ^+R d_l=0 ^_p=0 ^l
_n=0 ^2p  _q=0 ^n _2p-1,n 
m^4-2l r^-2l+1  (p+n-1+s) (p+n+12) 

&& n! q!(n-q)!  (-1)^n-q  A_l-p-1 (s+p+n-1-q) (s+p+n-1- q) .As it was expected at the beginning this is series over even
degree of mass and it gives contribution to the HKC with integer
indices. Comparing above expression with general Zeta3Dim  we
obtain general formula for arbitrary HKC coefficient with integer
index
hkcdensity 
B _l() = 4^3/2  (s+l-2) 
_p=0 ^l _n=0 ^2p 
_q=0 ^n _2p-1,n r^-2l+1  (p+n-
1+s) (p+n+12) n! (-1)^n-q  q!(n-q)!  A_l-p-1 (s+p+n-1- q) (s+p+n-1-q) .
Therefore, to obtain HKC with index  we have to take into
account expansion up to .

Let us now proceed to HKC with half-integer indices. To find them
we have to take into account the rest part of Eq. ME  with
even powers of  in expression for zeta-function Zeta1 .
The general form of even part is
SEven 
(S^+(x) + S^-(-x))^even  = () - 12 (S ^2_-1  ^4) - 1 + _n=1 ^^-2n S ^+_2n-1  S ^+_- 1   =
_p=0 ^^-2p  E_2p ,
where the first four functions  are listed in Appendix
, formula SeriesE .

We substitute now the expansion SEven  in the expression for
zeta-function:
^even _as (s - 12) = - m^2s 2s _l=0 ^^2-2s  _m ^dk (k^2 - m^2 ^2 )^1/2 -s   k 
_p=0 ^^-2p E_2p ,
and take the derivative with respect to the :
ZetaEven 
^even _as (s - 12) = - m^2s 2s _l=0 ^^2-2s  _m ^dk k (k^2 -
m^2 ^2 )^1/2 -s   _p=0 ^^-2p s_2p .
The functions  have the following structure
s_2p  = _n=0 ^2p  _2p,n  z^-p-n -1 ,
where . The first three coefficients are
listed in manifest form in Appendix A (see Eq. Seven ). The
coefficients  depend on the parameters  and 
and do not depend on the variable of integration . Going
the same way as we did for HKC with integer indices we obtain the
following asymptotic expression for even part of the zeta-function:
^even _as (s - 12) &=& 1 2(s-12) 
_l=0 ^_p=0 ^l _n=0 ^2p 
_q=0 ^n _2p,n 
m^3-2l r^-2l  (p+n-12+s) (p+n+1) 

&& n! q!(n-q)!  (-1)^n-q  A_l-p-1 (s+p+n-12-q) (s+p+n -12-q) As it was expected the even part of zeta-function is the series over odd
powers of mass and, therefore, it gives contributions to HKC
with half-integer indices. Comparing this expression with general
asymptotic series for zeta-function we obtain the following
formula for HKC with half-integer indices:
hkchalf 
B_l+12  = 4^3/2  (s+l-32) 
_p=0 ^l _n=0 ^2p  _q=0 ^n _2p,n r^-2l 
(p+n- 12 + s) (p+n+1) n!
(-1)^n-q  q!(n-q)!  A_l-p-1 (s+p+n - 12 - q) (s+p+n-12-q) .
We would like to note that the right hand side of formulas
hkcdensity  and hkchalf  does not depend, in fact, on
the , which is confirmed by straightforward calculations.

These formulas look very complicate but calculation may be done
easily using simple program in package Mathematica . Indeed,
the functions  and  may be found by using
formulas System  and SEven . The functions  are
obtained from the following relations:
s_2n-1 (k,) &=& 1k k [ .k
S ^+_2n-1 (x)_x=k  ],

s_2n (k,R) &=& 1k k [
.E_2n (x)_x=kR  ].

depend on the radial function  at boundary: . From Eqs.
hkcdensitygene  and hkchalfgen   we observe that the HKC
 and  are polynomial in  with degree .

It is well-known that the heat kernel coefficients
with integer indices consist of two parts. First part is an
integral over volume and another one is an integral over boundary.
We obtained slightly different representation for this coefficient
as integral over . But it is easy to see that they are in
agreement. Indeed, let us consider for example coefficient .
According with standard formula we have
B_1 = (16 -) _V R  dV + .13 _S tr K dS_+ .13 _S tr
K dS_Volume contribution is exactly the same as we have already
obtained OverB1 . Surface contribution from above formula is
13 _S tr K dS_+ 13 _S tr K
dS_= .16 3 r'r_From our result OverB1  we get the same expression
8 3 _-R ^+R  [r' ^2 + rr"]d=
8 3 _-R ^+R  [rr']'d= .16 3 
rr'_It is not so difficult to verify that the heat kernel coefficients
up to  are in agreement with general expressions. There is no
general expressions for higher coefficients.

According with Ref. the sufficient condition for
existing of the the self-consistent wormholes may be formulated in
terms of two heat kernel coefficients
B_2 &=& _- ^+  dB _2 =
h_2,2 ^2 + h_2,1 + h_2,0 ,

B_3 &=& _- ^+  dB _3 =
h_3,3 ^3 + h_3,2 ^2 + h_3,1 + h_3,0 .
Namely, both  and  have to be positive (We
would like to note that in Ref. instead of 
the coefficient  appears. It is connected with specific
form of wormholes. The point is that the background contains
singular surface of codimension one.) . The coefficients 
of polynomials depend on the structure of wormhole. Therefore the
problem reduces to analysis of polynomial in  of second and
third degree, the coefficients of which depend on the structure of
wormhole's space-time. Wormholes with different forms may exist
for different values of non-minimal connection , or vice
versa for some  the above polynomials will be positive for
specific form of wormholes.


The model of throat: 
 
In this section we consider in detail the specific model of
wormhole with the following profile of throat 
. From general expressions

B_52  &&  -^3/2  60R^2 .
Let us now proceed to renormalization and calculation of the zero
point energy. As noted in Sec.  (see Eq.
GenForm ) we have to subtract all terms which will survive in
the limit . According with general asymptotic
structure of the zeta-function given by Eq. Zeta3Dim  in this
limit the first five terms survive, namely HKC up to .
Because the zero point energy is proportional to zeta-function we
may speak about renormalization of the zeta function. According with
Eq. GenForm  we take asymptotic expansion for zeta-function
up to  (in the limit  these terms give
asymptotic (over ) expansion Zeta3Dim  up to heat kernel
coefficient ) and subtract its expansion over  up
to  from it. After taking the limit  we observe that
this difference will
give  Easfin . First of all we consider this
part and later will simplify the finite part Efin .

We should like to make a comment. In the problem under
consideration we have two different scales:  and  which give
us two dimensionless parameters  and . To extract terms
for renormalization we turn mass to infinity, which means the
Compone wavelength of scalar boson turns to zero and becomes
smaller then all scales of model. In other words it means that we
turn to infinity both parameters  and . After
renormalization we will turn  to infinity separately in order
to obtain the part which does not depend on the boundary.

Let us consider separately two parts of asymptotic expansion of
zeta-function according with odd and even powers of . First
of all we consider odd part which gives the HKC with integer
indices. All singularities are contained in the first three terms
in Ed. Zeta3Dim  with . After subtracting
these singularities we tend  and obtain some infinite
power series over parameters  and . Next, we have to
integrate over  and tend . For this reason we
have to obtain some expression instead of series to take  this
limit easily. It is impossible to take this limit directly in series. We
will use the Abel-Plana formula to extract the main
contribution from series in this limit. The rest will be a
good expression for
numerical calculations. Moreover, from this rest part we will
extract terms which will be divergent in the limit  to
analyze our formulas.

Our starting formula for odd part of zeta-function is Eq.ZetaOdd 
which cut up to :
ZetaOdd1 
^odd _as,2 (s - 12) = m^2s  (s - 12)  _-R ^+R  d_l=0 ^_p=0 ^2
_k=0 ^2p  _2p-1,k  r^2s-3  (s+p+k-1) (p+k+12)  ^2k+1  (^2 +
m^2r^2)^s+p+k-1  .
Expanding the denominator with the help of the formula
(1+x^2)^-s  = _n=0 ^(-1)^n n!  (n+s) (s)  x^2n ,
we represent  Eq. ZetaOdd1  in the following form
Odd 
^odd _as,2 (s - 12) = 1 (4)^3/2  1 (s - 12)  _- R ^+R  dm^2s 
_n=0 ^_p=0 ^2 m^2n  f_n,p (s),
where
f_n,p (s) = 8^3/2  (-1)^n n!  r^2n-3  _k=0 ^2p 
_2p- 1,k (n+p+k+s-1) (p+k+12) 
_H (2n+2p+2s-3,12).
In order to make formulas more readable we make everything dimensionless but
save the same notations. In any moment we may repair dimensional parameters by
changing  an . In this case we rewrite the expression for
zeta-function ZetaOdd1  in the following form
Oddd 
^odd _as,2 (s - 12) = m (4)^3/2  
m^2s  (s - 12)  _-R ^+R  d_n=0 ^_p=0 ^2 f_n,p (s),
From this expression we observe that for  the first three terms are
divergent with ; for  the first two terms with  and at last
for  the only term is divergent with . We remind that
(s-n)_s0  = (-1)^n n!  (1s +
(n+1)) + O(s), _H (s+1,q)_s0  = 1s - (q) + O(s).
For this reason we represent zeta-function ZetaOdd1  in the
following form (for )
OddGen 
^odd _as,2 (s - 12) &=& m (4)^3/2  1 (s - 12)  _-R ^+R  d
r^2s _n=0 ^2 f_n,0 (s) + _n=3 ^f_n,0 (0)

&+& m (4)^3/2  1 (s - 12)

_n=2 ^f_n,1 (0)

&+& m (4)^3/2  1 (s - 12) 
_-R ^+R  d r^2s f_0,2 (s) + _n=1 ^f_n,2 (0)and will analyze each part separately.

To illustrate the calculations  we consider in details the first
part OddGen1 . First of all it is not difficult to find the
manifest form of singular part in the limit :
_n=0 ^2 f_n,0  (s) &=& 4r^2 (s-2) +  3
(s-1) +
7 120r^2  (s) + r^2 [-3 + 4+ 8 (2)]

&+&  3 [1+2(2) + 24 (-1)] -  120r^2 [-7 + 2(2) - 1680 (-3)]. We observe that this term gives contribution to  and
 according with gamma functions. For renormalization we have
to subtract from this expression the first three terms according
to our scheme.

There is one important moment which is crucial for our analysis.
Above formula contains all terms which survive in the limit 
 for arbitrary mass of field. For renormalization we have to
subtract asymptotic expansion in the form Zeta3Dim . There is a
difference in factor . For this reason after
renormalization factor
(r^2s  - 1) (4r^2 (s-2) +  3 (s-1) +
7 120r^2  (s))_s0  = [2r^2  -
 3 + 7 120r^2  ] r^2
appears. If we take into account all terms in Eq. OddGen  we
obtain the following contribution
LogTerms 
(r^2) (12 B _0 - B _1
+B _2).
Exactly the same structure was observed before in Refs.
. This term defines the behavior of
energy for small size of wormhole because it is maximally
divergent for small size of wormhole.

Therefore the renormalized contribution is
_n=0 ^2 f_n,0 ^ren  (s) &=& [2r^2  -  3  +
7 120r^2  ] r^2 + r^2 [-3 + 4+ 8 (2)]

&+&  3 [1+2(2) + 24 (-1)] -  120r^2 [-7 + 2(2) - 1680 (-3)]. We represent the finite part in the following form
_n=3 ^f_n,0  (0) = 8 r^2  _l=0 ^^3 (1 + r^2 ^2 ) - r^2 ^2  + 12 r^4 ^4  + r^2 ^2 [(1 + r^2 ^2 ) - r^2 ^2 ]
by using standard series representation for Hurwitz zeta-function.
To find more suitable form for these series we use the Abel-Plana
formula and obtain
_l=0 ^^2 [(1 + r^2 ^2 ) - r^2 ^2 ]&=& -12 r^2 (r^2) - r^2 [2(2) + - 12] + 2 _0^d e^2  + 1  1-
r^2 ^2 ,

_l=0 ^^3 [(1 + r^2 ^2 ) - r^2 ^2  + 12 r^4 ^4 ]&=& 14 r^4 (r^2) -124  r^2 + r^4
[2(2) + - 18] - 2 _0^d^3
 e^2  + 1  1-r^2 ^2 .
Taking into account these formulas we have
_n=0 ^2 f_n,0  (0) + _n=3 ^f_n,0 ^ren (0) =
16_0^d^3  e^2  + 1 
1-^2 r^2  + ^2 r^2 - ^2 r^2  1-^2 r^2 .
We now integrate this formula over  from  to 
according with Eq. OddGen1  and take the limit .
After this we arrive at the expression
OddGen1 &=&-m16^2 f_a=-m16^2 
f_a^sing  +_a, where  

f_a^sing &=&7^2 60 a (a) + ^2  a(7120  + 110  (2) + 14 (-3)).
The manifest form of the regular contribution has written out in
Appendix  (see Eq. ). We extracted all terms
with logarithm and that which is singular for  and
collected them in . The rest part, , is a
regular contribution.

Using the same procedure for second and third parts we obtain the
following expressions
OddGen2 &=&-m16^2 f_b=-m16^2 
f_b^sing  +_b, where  

f_b^sing  &=& ^2 [-16 a (- 16) + 1a (23- 16)] (a) + 1a
[-13 (1 + 24+ 19 (1 + 18(-1)) ]. 

OddGen3 &=&-m16^2 f_c=-m16^2 
f_c^sing  +_c, where  

f_c^sing  &=& ^2 a [6^2 - 83 + 720 ] (a) 

&+& ^2 a [12 (-7+12+ 36 2)^2 + 16 (15 -16- 482)+ 1360 (-143 + 126+

 have written out in Appendix  (Eq.
Omegaabc ).

Putting together all contributions in OddGen  we obtain
^ren _odd  = -m16^2  (a^2)

a(- 16 )) + ,
where
&=& _a + _b + _c + ^2 a [12(-7+12+ 362)^2 - 16 (-13+481)+16+ 482).

contribution  and b) regular part   
Let us now proceed to the contribution from even part of
zeta-function. We start from Eq. ZetaEven  and do not take
the limit of great mass. Integrating over  we obtain the
following expression for this even part
ZetaEven1 
^even _as (s - 12) = m^2s  (s - 12) 
_l=0 ^_p=0 ^1 _k=0 ^2p  _2p,k 
r^2s-3  (s+p+k-12) (p+k+ 1)  ^2k+1  (^2 + m^2r^2)^s+p+k- 12  .
Here  is taken at the point . Now we pass to dimensionless variables (with
the same notations) and  have
ZetaEven2 
^even _as (s - 12) = m (4)^3/2 (s -
12)  _p=0 ^1 _k=0 ^2p  _2p,k  (4)^3/2  r^3  (s+p+k-12) (p+k+ 1) 
_p,k ,
where
_p,k =_l=0 ^^2k+1  (^2 +
m^2r^2)^s+p+k- 12  
Analytical continuation  in this series may be easily done
by using the Abel-Plana formula:
_0,0  &=& -13 r^3  + 124  r  - 2 r _r^dEx() -
2r _0^r ^3 d 1-^2 r^2    Ex(),

_1,0  &=& - r + 2r _0^r d[3 Ex() + Ex'()] 1- ^2 r^2  

_1,1  &=& -2 r + 2r _0^r d[6 Ex() + 6Ex'() + ^2 Ex"()] 1-^2 r^2  

_1,2  &=& -53 r + 2r _0^r d[8 Ex() +
12 Ex'() + 4 ^2 Ex"() + 13 ^3 Ex"'()] 1-^2 r^2  ,

where
Ex() = 1e^2  + 1 .
Now we substitute these formulas in Eq. ZetaEven2  and take
the limit . In this limit all integrals in
expressions for  are smaller the . Taking into
account that  and 
we obtain in this limit (we repair dimensional variables)
^even _as (s - 12) = m (4)^3/2 (s -
12)   m^3 B_12  (s - 32) + m B_32  (s - 12)  + O(1R + a ).
Therefore after renormalization (subtracting these two terms) we take
the limit
 and obtain zero contribution from this even part
^even _ren (s - 12) = 0.
Thus there is the only contribution from the odd part. Collecting
all terms together we arrive at the following expression for zero
point energy
Erenfin 
E^ren  = -m32^2  (ma)^2 ^2(1ma 
[3^2 - + 320 ] + 8ma(- 16
)) + ,
where

&& y  S^+(+mR) + S^-(-mR) -

and .

The main problem now is the calculation of the last term in
expression for . Let us simplify the expression and show
that in the limit  the divergent parts are cancelled.
Indeed, let us consider the first five terms of uniform expansion
[S^+(R) + S^-(-R)]_3^uni.exp.  = _n=0 ^2
^1-2n _-kR ^+kR S ^+_2n-1 dx + _n=0 ^1
^-2n  E_2n  .
It is very easy to take the limit in the part with even power of
 by using the manifest form of  listed in Appendix
. The only term which gives the non-zero contribution is
 :
E_0 _R  &=& -2 (kR) + (ka) + O(R^-2 ),

E_2 _R  &=&  O(R^-2 ).
The part with odd power of  in the uniform expansion brings
the single linear on  divergent contribution coming from
:
2 (kR) .
Therefore in the limit  the uniform expansion gives
the following divergent contribution:
2 (kR) -2 (kR) + (ka).
Because later we have to take the derivative with respect to 
we may rewrite this expression in the following way
2 (kR) - (ka).
To take the limit of large box in  let us
reduce the radial equation to standard form of scattering problem
by changing the form of radial function .
In this case the equation reads
SchrEq 
[-d^2 d^2  + l(l+1) ^2 + a^2  + a^2
(1-2) (^2 + a^2)^2 ] = ^2 .
This equation looks similar to the equation of scattering problem in
one dimension (do not forget that )
with non-singular symmetric potential
BarrierDef 
V_l (,a)= l(l+1) ^2 + a^2  + a^2
(1-2) (^2 + a^2)^2 .
From standard theory of one-dimensional scattering we know that
there are two independent solutions which have the following
properties (as opposite to traditional notations  we use
solutions  to make coincidence with functions we use)
_1() &&  , .

_2() &&  , .
where  constitute the  matrix of
scattering problem. Due to symmetry of the potential the
components of the matrix obey the relation .

Now we change energy to imaginary axis:  and
obtain
_1(+R)_2(-R)_R  = s_11 ^2(ik)
e^2kR .
Therefore
[S^+(+R) + S^-(-R)]_R  = (_1(+R)_2(-R))_R  = [s_11 ^2(ik)]
+ 2kR,
and the divergent parts in Omega  are cancelled. Thus we
arrive at the following expression for 
OmegaFin 
&=& +  32_l=0 ^^2 
_1 ^d y (y^2 - 1 ^2 )^1/2  

&& y  [y s_11 ^2(iym)] - _n=0 ^2 ^1-2n  _- ^+ 
[S _2n-1 ^+ - _0,n ]dx 
Thus, we express the finite part of the zero point energy in terms
of the  matrix of scattering problem, namely in term of the
transmission coefficient of the barrier in imaginary axis. Similar
relation was found by Bordag in Ref.. The potential
 of scattering problem has the following properties
V_l(0,a) &=& l(l+1) + 1 - 2 a^2  - the height of
barrier ,

_- ^+ V_l(,a) d&=&[2l(l+1) + 1
- 2] 2a  - the work against potential barrier .
Therefore the zero point energy has the form Erenfin , where
the function  is given by expression OmegaFin . We
should like to note that according with
 the factor before logarithm term in
Erenfin  is . The origin of this
structure has been already noted in Eq. LogTerms .

Now we analyze qualitatively without exact numerical calculations
the behavior of energy for small and large radii of throat.
According with Eqs. Small  and Large  the zero point
energy in  dimensions has the following behavior for small
and large values of throat
E^ren  && -B_2 (am)^2 32^2 , a0, 

E^ren  && -B_3 32^2 m^2 , a,
or in manifest form:
E^ren  && -m32  (ma)^2 ma  [3^2 -
+ 320 ], a0, 

E^ren  && -m32  1 (ma)^3  1 4032 
[5880^3 - 6300^2 + 2226-257], a.
It is easy to verify that coefficient after logarithm in Eq.
ato0 , which is contribution from  in the limit 
, is never to be zero or negative. It is always positive.
For this reason the zero point energy is positive for small radius
of throat for arbitrary constant of non-conformal coupling .
In the domain of large radius of throat the expression in brackets
in Eq. atoinfty , which is the contribution from  in the
limit , may change its sign. It is positive for 
 (energy negative) and negative (energy positive) in the
opposite case. Therefore we conclude that there is minimum of
ground state energy if constant . The situation is
opposite to that which appeared in our last paper,
where the
energy for large value of throat (which was defined by )
was always positive, but for small radius of throat it could change
its sign.

Let us now consider the semiclassical Einstein equations:
ee 
G_ =8G c^4 T_ ^ren ,
where  is the Einstein tensor, and 
 is the renormalized vacuum expectation values
of the stress-energy tensor of the scalar field. The total energy
in a static space-time is given by
E=_V  g^(3)   d^3x,
where 
 is energy density, and the integral is calculated over
the whole space. In the spherically symmetric metric Metric 
we obtain
total 
E=-c^4 2G  _- ^  G_t^t r^2() d=
-c^4a 2G .
The zero point energy has the following form
ground 
E^ren =-c a f(ma,).
In the self-consistent case the total energy must coincide with
the ground state energy of the scalar field. Equating Eqs.
ground  and total  gives
c^4 a 2G =c a f(ma,),
or
a=l_P 2f(ma,) .
Considering this equation at the minimum of zero point energy we
obtain some value of wormhole's radius. The concrete value of
radius may be found from exact numerical calculation of the zero
point energy as function of . But without this calculation we
conclude that the wormholes with the throat's profile First 
may exist for .

The model of throat: 
 
We will not reproduce here the density for heat kernel
coefficients in manifest form due to their complexity. They may be
found from general formulas hkcdensitygene . There are two parameters
in this model  and . The
dimensional parameter  characterizes this kind of wormhole as a whole.
Small value of this parameter indicates small size of wormhole. The
dimensionless parameter  characterizes the form of wormhole -
its ratio of the length and radius of throat. By changing the integration
variable  we observe that coefficients  and  have the
following structure which is clear from
dimensional consideration:
B_2 &=& _- ^+  dB _2 = 1a
[b_2,2 ^2 + b_2,1 + b_2,0 ],

B_3 &=& _- ^+  dB _3 = 1a^3 
[b_3,3 ^3 + b_3,2 ^2 + b_3,1 + b_3,0 ],
where  depend on the , only. We note
that  as it is seen from OverB2 . Therefore we may
analyze the zero point energy for different values of the
parameter . From the general point of view we have the following
behavior of the zero point energy for small size of wormhole that is
for small value of :
E^ren  -(ma)^2 32^2  B_2 = - (
ma)^2 32^2 a [b_2,2 ^2 + b_2,1 + b_2,0 ].
 
fig3.eps   The
discriminant  of polynomial
in  as function of . It is always negative for all
values of . It means that the zero point energy is always
positive for small value of radius of throat.  
Using the general expression for coefficient  it is possible
to find in manifest form the polynomial in  in
ErenSmall  for great value of  (small
radius of wormhole throat comparing with its length):
Discsmall 
E^ren  -3  (ma)^2 240 a
 [30^2 - 10+ 1],
and for small value of  (small length of wormhole
throat comparing with its radius):
DiscLarge 
E^ren  -(15 - ^2)(ma)^2 1350a  
[240^2 - 80+ 7].
The numerical calculations of the discriminant 
 of polynomial in  as function of 
is shown in Fig. . From this figure and Eqs.
Discsmall , DiscLarge  we conclude that the discriminant
is always negative for arbitrary values of . It means that
the zero point energy is always positive for small size of
wormhole for arbitrary constant of non-minimal coupling  and
arbitrary ratio of the length of throat and its radius.

The behavior of zero point energy for large size of wormhole
() has the following form
E^ren  -B_3 32^2 m^2  = -1 32^2 m^2 a^3 
[b_3,3 ^3 + b_3,2 ^2 + b_3,1 + b_3,0 ].
The zero point energy will get minimum for some value of  if
above expression will be negative. Let us consider the polynomial
P = b_3,3 ^3 + b_3,2 ^2 + b_3,1 + b_3,0 
for different values of  starting from small value of it.
Zero point energy will get minimum if this polynomials is
positive. In the limit  we have approximately
^3 P&& 512(45 - 4 ^2
) 135  ^3 - ( 256(21 -
2 ^2 ) 189  + 256(45 - 4 ^2 )  135 )  ^2 

&+& ( 512(21 - 2 ^2 )  945  +
224(45 - 4 ^2 )  675 )
- 368( 21 - 2 ^2 )  6615  +
  44( 45 - 4 ^2 )  2025 .
In this expression we saved terms up to . This
polynomial in the limit  has two complex roots and
one is real:
5( 21 - 2 ^2 ) 14( 45 -
4 ^2 )  1.
Because the coefficient with  is positive the polynomials
will be positive for all
> 5( 21 - 2 ^2 ) 14( 45 - 4 ^2 )  1.
Therefore for small values of  we have
low  boundary for parameter  where the wormhole may
exist (see Fig.(I)). The greater  the smaller
the low boundary of . For  the conformal
connection  will be greater then the low boundary. At
the point  two domains appear where polynomial is
positive. First domain is  and second 
 (see Fig.(II) for ). The low
boundary of second domain will increase for greater  and
it disappears for . At this point the coefficients
 and the polynomial turns out to be parabola (see
Fig.(III)) with positive part in domain: 
. For greater  we obtain upper  boundary
of  where the polynomials is positive because the coefficient
with  is negative. Starting from  we have
two domains where the polynomial is positive (see
Fig.(IV)). First one closes to 
and another one is smaller then some negative value of . For
 the high boundary of second domain will coincide
with low boundary of first domain and we get the only domain where
polynomial is positive . For greater value of 
 this high boundary of  tends to constant (see
Fig.(V)). Indeed, in the limit  we
have
P ^2 3  [ -5^3 + 52^2
- 12+ 121 ]
and it is positive for all . We would like to note
that for  the polynomial is positive for 
.

plots of the polynomial  for different values of ratio

Let us consider now what condition gives the Einstein's
equations. The energy corresponding for this configuration is
total1 
E=-c^4 2G  _- ^  G_t^t r^2() d=
-2c^4 G  [1 - 15-^2 18  ]a.
Equating this energy with zero point energy
E^ren =-c a f(am,,)
we obtain the relation
[1 - 15-^2 18 ]a^2 = l_P^2f(am,,).
To find parameters of stable wormholes of this kind we have to
consider this equation at the minimum of function 
. Because the function  at the minimum is
positive, we conclude that the stable wormhole may exist for
. For  the polynomial
is equal to zero for . Therefore the stable wormholes
with this profile of throat may exist only for .
This upper boundary depends on the model of throat. For example,
wormhole with profile of throat
r() = + a
gives another boundary, namely .
Specific value of  and region of  may be found by
numerical calculation of the function .

Conclusion 
In the paper we analyzed the possibility of existence of the
semi-classical wormholes with metric Metric  and throat's
profile given by Eqs.First ,Second . Our approach
consists of considering two heat kernel coefficients  and
. We developed a method for calculation the heat kernel
coefficient and obtained general expression for arbitrary
coefficient in background Metric . The first seven
coefficients in manifest form for arbitrary profile of throat are
given by Eqs. hkcdensitygene  and hkchalfgen . The
sufficient condition for existence of wormhole is positivity of both
 and . Some additional conditions may follow from 
component of the Einstein's equations.

The common property of both models is that the zero point energy
for small size of wormhole is always positive for arbitrary
constant . This statement is opposite to that obtained for
zero length throat model in Ref.. The behavior of
zero point energy for large size of wormhole crucially depends on
the non-minimal coupling  and parameters of the model. We
show that the wormholes with the first profile of throat may be a
self-consistent solution of semi-classical Einstein's equations if
the constant of non-minimal connection . This type of
wormholes is characterized by the only parameter , which is the
radius of wormhole's throat. The space outside of throat
polynomially tends to Minkowkian and there is no way to define the length
of throat. We would like to note that the minimal connection
 and conformal connection  do not obey this
condition.

The second model of wormhole's throat Second  is
characterized by two parameters  and . The latter is the
radius of wormhole's throat and first is the length of throat. It
is possible to introduce the length of throat because the space
outside the throat becomes Minkowskian exponentially fast. Suitable
illustration for this statement is Fig.(III). The
existence of this kind of wormholes crucially depends on the
parameter  and ratio of the length and radius of throat: 
. The general condition for  follows from
Einstein's equations, namely . The wormhole with
very small parameter  may be self-consistent considered by
scalar massive field with large value of . The
scalar field with conformal connection  may
self-consistently describe wormholes with .
For  we obtain another interval .

We would like to note that in the limit of zero length of throat
 there is no connection with results of our
last paper where we considered wormhole with zero
length of throat. The point is that the model considered in that
paper is singular at the beginning. The scalar curvature is
singular at throat and there is a singular surface with
codimension one. For this case in Ref. the general
formulas for heat kernel coefficients were obtained which
can not be found as limit case of expression for smooth background
. The reason of this lies in the following. The heat
kernel coefficients are defined as an expansion of heat kernel
over some dimension parameter which must be smaller then
characteristic scale of background. For smooth background we may
make this ratio small by taking appropriate value of expansion
parameter, but singular background has at the beginning the zero
value of background's scale. This leads to new form of heat kernel
coefficients. Furthermore, in the limit of large box  in
this background the coefficient  survives and it
defines the behavior of energy for large size of wormhole.

Another interesting achievement of the paper is developing of the
zeta-function approach. The radial equation in this
background RadEqu  can not be solved in close form even for
simple profile of throat First . We obtain the general
formula for asymptotic expansion of solutions ME , using
which we find the heat kernel coefficients hkcdensitygene ,
hkchalfgen  in general form. After renormalization the
zero point energy may be expressed in terms of the  matrix of
scattering problem Erenfin , OmegaFin . More precisely,
we need only transmission coefficient  of barrier
BarrierDef , BarrierProp . The point is that the radial
equation for massive scalar field in the background Metric 
looks like a one-dimensional Schrodinger equation SchrEq 
for particle with potential BarrierDef . This potential
depends on both orbital momentum  of particle and non-minimal
coupling constant  as well as on the radius of throat  of
wormhole.

In first model the domain of  for which the energy may
possess a minimum is limited from below. The reason of this
is connected with the fact that the effective mass
m^2_eff  = m^2 + R  = m^2 - 2a^2 (^2 +
a^2)^2 
may change its sign for some  limited from below. The same
situation occurs in the short-throat flat-space wormhole
 where the scalar curvature is negative, too. This
is not the case for second model. The scalar curvature in this
model
R =-6y^2 + 4- 5 ^2 + ( 4y^2 +
(-4 + 5))(2y  )
- 2y(-2 + 5) (2y  ) ^2
^4(y  )( 1 - + y (y  ) )  ^2 
may change its sign depending on the parameters of model. For
small  it is negative but starting from 
the domain around  appears, where the curvature becomes positive.
This domain becomes larger for larger values of  and for
 great enough the curvature is, in fact, positive. It is
in qualitative agreement with above consideration. Indeed for
small values of  (negative scalar curvature) we obtained
low  boundary for  and vise versa, for large values of
 (positive scalar curvature) we obtained upper 
boundary for .
