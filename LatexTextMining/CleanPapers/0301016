The symmetry algebra of massless fields living on the
3-dimensional conformal boundary of  is shown to be
isomorphic to  conformal higher spin algebra ( higher
spin algebra). A simple realization of this algebra on the free
flat  massless matter fields is given in terms of an auxiliary
Fock module.


Introduction 
The first example of the full interacting higher spin theory was
given in 1990 by M. Vasiliev  (see also for
reviews). It is formulated in  space and describes an
interaction of the fields of all spins, which is invariant under
the  higher-spin gauge symmetry algebra. It was
then conjectured by Fradkin and Linetsky that 3d
conformal higher spin algebras have to be identified with the
 higher spin algebra. One motivation of this work is to
check whether the symmetries of the massless fields living on the
-dimensional conformal boundary of  do form the  3d
conformal higher spin algebra. It will be shown that this is
indeed the case.

Another motivation comes from Maldacena conjecture on AdS/CFT
correspondence that suggests a duality between the theory
of gravity in the  bulk space and 3-dimensional conformal
theory on the boundary of . Since  higher spin
theory contains supergravity it seems natural to speculate that
 higher spin theory should have some dual 3-dimensional
theory possessing the  higher spin symmetry algebra as 3d
conformal higher spin algebra. It is therefore interesting to
realize the 3d conformal higher spin algebra on the 3-dimensional
matter fields (scalar and spinor), which are the only conformal
fields in 3-dimensional higher spin theory. This realization is
the main topic of this talk. It is obtained using the method of
unfolded formulation, which is very suitable  for the analysis of
symmetries of  dynamical systems. In this presentation we
summaries the main ideas and results. More details can be found in
the original work, where not only flat but also 
matter system is considered and the duality between non-unitary
field-theoretical representations of the conformal algebra and the
unitary (singleton-type) representations of the 
conformal algebra  is found in the form of a certain
Bogolyubov transform.

Let us note that recently in the interesting paperKlebanov and Polyakov suggested that the full nonlinear 
higher spin theory is dual to the large  limit of the conformal
 vector model which is a nonlinear deformation of the system
considered here. Hopefully, an appropriate deformation of the
system within our scheme may help to check this conjecture.


 higher spin algebra and its oscillator realization 
The infinite dimensional superextension  of the ordinary
 algebra  is called  higher spin algebra
if:

1.  is graded, i.e.  decomposes into the infinite direct sum
graded_algebra  f=_l=- ^ f_l of
finite-dimensional subspaces , which are called levels, and


2. every level  forms a finite-dimensional representation of
the Lorentz subalgebra 

3. and, finally,  obey the admissibility condition of
possessing massless unitary representation with the same spectra
of spins as predicted by the structure of gauge fields originating
from .

The simplest version of the  higher spin algebra (
conformal higher spin algebra) can be constructed with the help of
the oscillator realization of the  algebra.

Consider oscillators  and  ( are
spinorial indices) with the commutation relations
[a_,a^+_]=_ ,[a_,a_]=[ a^+_,
a^+_]=0.
Here  is antisymmetric charge conjugation matrix
 that rises and lowers spinorial indices
a^ ,a_ .
The bilinear combinations of oscillators () form
the algebra . The conformal basis of
 is given by the formulas
so_basis 
&_nm =-1 4 _nmk ^k (a_a^+_+
a^+_a_),

&_n=1 2 _n ^ a_a_,
_n=1 2 _n ^ a^+_a^+_,

&1 4 (a_a^+ +a^+ a_),
where  are generators of Lorentz subalgebra
 while   and  are
generators of momenta, special conformal transformations and
dilatation. Here  and 
are the unit matrix and the first and the third Pauli matrixes,
respectively.

Considering  also linear combinations of
oscillators () we extend the algebra
 to the superalgebra  with supergenerators
_Q_The  higher spin algebra is defined as a further
generalization of this construction. Let  be the associative
algebra, enveloping the oscillator commutation relations
(), i.e.  contains all possible combinations
of oscillators. Let Lie() be Lie superalgebra built from 
with use of the supercommutator [f,g]_=fg-(-1)^(f)(g) gf, where ,  are some monomials
from  and  is the parity function which counts the
oddness of the oscillators in  f(a,a^+)=(-1)^(f) f(-a,-a^+). Following the general
notation of  let  denote Lie algebra
Lie(). The  higher spin algebra ( conformal higher
spin algebra), denoted by , is a real part of
 which is singled out by the condition -(i)^(f) f(ia,ia^+)=f(a,a^+) for .

It can be easily seen that the algebra  fits the first
and the second parts of the definition of the  higher spin
algebra given at the beginning of the section. Really it is graded
(), with the levels  consisting
from those elements of  that   of  a^+ -
 of  a=l and every level is closed under the adjoint
action of  . In it was sown that 
also satisfy admissibility condition (the third part of the
definition).

Unfolded formulation of dynamical systems:

Massless Scalar Example 
The general properties of the unfolded
formulation of dynamical systems were studied in. The
key observation is that any free dynamical system can be
reformulated in a form of zero curvature and covariant constancy
conditions
& d (x) =(x)(x),

& d =t((x)), where  is connection 1-form taking values in the gauge
symmetry algebra of the considered dynamical system and  is
some vector from the representation  of this algebra.
For such a formulation to work the vector  should contain
usually infinite set of auxiliary fields.

In what follows we require the connection 1-form 
to take values in  higher spin algebra  and
 to be a Fock representation of , generated
by  from the Fock vacuum  that is annihilated by

Fock_vacuum 
a_Let us illustrate the properties of the unfolded formulation
(), () of the
dynamical systems by the example of the free massless flat
3-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation . To this end we
introduce infinitely many auxiliary fields, which are  totally
symmetric multispinors of all even ranks
c__1_2 (x),c__1_2_3_4 (x),.
Consider the infinite system of differential equations  for these
fields and the original scalar field 
&_n c(x)=1 2 _n ^_1_2 
c__1_2 (x),

&_n
c__1_2 (x)=1 2 _n ^_3_4 
c__1_2_3_4 (x),

&

&_n
c__1_2k  (x)=1 2 
_n ^_2k+1 _2k+2  c__1_2k+2  (x),

&Since the matrixes  are reversible
_n ^ _m _ =2_nm 
we can express all the higher multispinors
 () via the derivatives of
the dynamical field  as
&c__1_2 (x)=^n __1_2 _n
c(x),

&c__1_2_3_4 (x)
=^n_1  __1_2 
^n_2  __3_4 _n_1  _n_2 c(x),

&

&c__1_2k  (x)
=^n_1  __1_2 ^n_k  __2k-1 _2k  _n_1 _n_k c(x),

&Note that the left hand sides of these expressions are required to
be totally symmetric. This has a consequence that the field 
has to satisfy the Klein-Gordon equation
K_G 
c(x)=0
being the consistency condition for this system. Therefore,
the system (), (),
() is equivalent to the infinite set of
constraints (), (),
() for all higher multispinors and the
Klein-Gordon equation for the dynamical field .

The analogous system of equations for the spinor field
 involves all odd rank auxiliary multispinors
 (). It encodes the free
massless Dirac equation
Dirac 
_n^n _  ^ c_(x)=0.
Thus we  conclude that Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations
(), () are concisely encoded as consistency
conditions of the system
_n c__1_l  (x)
=1 2 _n ^_l+1 _l+2  c__1_l+2  (x)
l=0,,,
where  and  are dynamical fields and totally
symmetric multispinors  () are
axillary fields expressed via higher derivatives of the dynamical
fields.

In fact, the system () is a special
case of the general system (),
() when  is a flat connection
of particular form
(x)=_0(x)=1 2 dx^n_n ^ a_a_and
l=0 ^1 l! c__1_l (x)a^+_1 
a^+_l 
is some element of an axillary Fock space ()
playing the role of a generating function for the ,
 and all axillary fields 
().

It is important that any  system that can be rewritten in the form
(), () (in
particular, the system ()) is
invariant under the following transformations
gauge_transformations 
&(x)=d(x)-[(x),(x)],

&with the gauge symmetry parameter . The different choices
of the connection  in (),
() correspond to the different choices
of space-time coordinates in the differential equations under
consideration (like Klein-Gordon and Dirac equation). Once
some solution of the zero curvature equation
() is fixed, the gauge symmetry
() breaks down to the global symmetry
&(x)=0,

&with the
symmetry parameter  keeping the connection 
invariant and thus satisfying the differential equation
eq_for_global_symmetry_parameter 
 d_0(x)-[_0(x),_0(x)]=0.
We thus obtain that the system () and,
most important, Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations encoded by it are
invariant under the transformations (). So
the unfolded formulation allows one to write down the dynamical
equations in a manifestly symmetric form.

Also such an approach allows one to write generic solution of
the system (), ()
as well as the solution of the equation
() for the global symmetry
parameter . These solutions are
&_0(x)=-g(x)^-1 d g(x),

&-1 _0,

&_0(x)=g(x)^-1 g(x). Here  is some
invertible element constructed from oscillators, which give rise
to  in a pure gauge form
() and  is an arbitrary
element of the  higher spin algebra ( conformal higher
spin algebra) , playing a role of the initial data for
the differential equation ()
 for  . The formula
() realizes the
isomorphism between algebra of the symmetries of the free flat
massless 3-dimensional Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations and 3d
conformal higher spin algebra . Moreover, this formula
allows us to obtain the particular realization of  on
3-dimensional massless scalar and spinor.

Realization of  on 3d matter system 
Let us come back to the  system of interest
(). From the equation
() it can be easily seen that
, giving rise to flat connection
, can be
taken in the form g_0(x)=(-1 2 x^n_n ^ a_a_). Using
() and
() we can represent  on the set of
all (dynamical and axillary) fields 
. Then taking into account the constrains
(), (), () we
can finally realize  as differential operators acting
on the matter fields  and .  For the simple
low-order polynomials  this can be done "by hand" using the
Campbell-Hausdorf formula e^Ae^B=e^A+B+1 2 [A,B]+ , with the only first
three nonzero terms. In particular, for the conformal subalgebra
 we arrive at well known result &&_nm c(x)=(x_m_n-x_n_m)c(x),

&&
_nm c_(x)=((x_m_n-x_n_m)_^+
1 2 _nmk ^k  _) c_(x),

&&_n c(x)=_n
c(x),
_n c_(x)=_n c_(x),

&&_n c(x)=(x_n+2x_n x^k_k-x^2_n )c(x),

&&_n c_(x)= ((2x_n+2x_n x^k
_k-x^2_n)_^_nmk x^m^k  _) c_(x),

&&c(x)=(1 2 +x^k _k) c(x),c_(x)=(1+x^k_k) c_(x).
For the general case the computations are less trivial and involve
the technique of symbols of operators. The final result for a
general element of  represented with use of the
generating function  is of the
following form = 
(1 2 x^ h_h_+ a^+ h_+1 2 h^+ h_) (
a^+ +x^ h_+h^+ ,x) .
