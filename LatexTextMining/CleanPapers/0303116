where  is the canonically normalized field.
By these equations we expect the terms that get strong at the
scale  to have the form 
[counterterms]
L _bdy  ^4 (    )^n
( R() m^2  )^p
( K m  )^q.
Note that the theory becomes strongly coupled whenever the 4D curvature
is of order . 
We will comment further on this point in Section 4 below.

Note also that the cubic interaction 3int  is nonlocal when written
in terms of geometrical quantities
(since  and ).
This means that loops of  fields should not renormalize this interaction,
and that the divergent part of loop diagrams involving this interaction
should be expressible as a  function of .

(A full calculation should include loops of bulk fields as well.
However, the scaling argument shows the leading 
interactions at the scale  are expressible
in terms of the interactions of the  field.) 

This non-renormalization theorem follows simply by integration by
parts.
Consider any 1PI diagram with an external line coming from one
of the factors of  with only one derivative.
Because the diagram is 1PI, both of the other  factors attach
to internal lines.
We then have
^_ext  __int  _4 _int 
= ^_ext  _[
__int  __int 
- 12 _  ^_int  __int  ],
which is a function of  after integration by parts.
This gives a nice check of the consistency of this framework.


Classical Instabilities 

In this section we study a classical solution to the DGP model
in which the stress-energy tensor on the brane satisfies the dominant
energy condition, yet the brane has negative energy from the 5D point of view.
When the boundary has the topology of  it is difficult to define
the 5D energy, which is presumably infinite.
We therefore look for static solution where the spatial sections of the boundary
have topology , the bulk is 'outside' the ,
and the solution is  symmetric.
The geometry of the boundary therefore corresponds to a spatially compact
static cosmological solution, similar to the Einstein universe.

By Birkhoff's theorem, the metric outside the boundary is the 5D
Schwarzschild metric
[SSmetric]
ds^2 = -f^2(r) dt^2 + dr^2 f^2(r)  + r^2 d_3^2,
f = 1 - R_S ^2 r^2  
where  is the Schwarzschild radius.
The boundary is at a fixed value of  in these coordinates.
Because this solution asymptotes to 5D flat space at infinity, the energy
(mass)
of the solution is well-defined:
[SSmass]
M = 32 M_5^3 R_S ^2.
For  such a solution has negative energy.
It is a negative-mass Schwarzschild solution with the naked singularity
cut out by the boundary.

The most general form of the stress-energy tensor on the brane
compatible with the symmetries is
T_00  = -_00 ,
T_ij  = + p _ij ,
where  is the energy density and  is the pressure.
We impose the equation of state
p = w .
We look for solutions satisfying the dominant energy condition,
which requires
0,
-1 w 1.
The bulk Einstein equations are satisfied by the metric SSmetric .
The only additional equation that must be satisfied is
[bdyequ]
4 M_4^2 G _ () - 4 M_5^3 (K_  - _  K)
= T_ ,
where  is the Einstein tensor
and  is a stress tensor on the boundary.
bdyequ  follows simply from the variation of the full action 
with free boundary conditions.
(There is no junction equation in this approach since there is
no 'other side' to the boundary.)
In the metric SSmetric , we can use Kdef  to obtain
K_  = 12 f _r _ .
The boundary equation bdyequ  then gives
[Einsteintime]
4 M_4^2 3 r^2  - 4 M_5^3 3 f r  &= ,


Einsteinspace 
4 M_4^2 1 r^2  - 4 M_5^3 1r  ( f + 1f  )
&= -w .
Note that when  the 4D solution reduces to 
the standard Einstein static universe with , . 
When , bdyequ  is equivalent to the usual Israel junction
conditions, and Einsteintime  and Einsteinspace  have no
solutions satisfying the dominant energy condition.
(In fact, they have no solutions even if the stress energy tensor is allowed
to be written as a negative tension term plus a term satisfying the
dominant energy condition.)

The constraint  gives
[weakineq]
r f 1 m .
Combining Einsteintime  and Einsteinspace  we obtain
[massformula]
w = -13 + 4 M_5^3 r f ,
which shows that  is satisfied whenever .
The condition  gives
[strongineq]
r f + r 4 f  1m.
Since this is clearly more restrictive than weakineq , this is
the only condition that needs to be checked.
For  (),
the of strongineq  approaches  as  and
increases monotonically with , so we obtain
a solution for .
This means that the energy cannot be made arbitrarily negative in this
model (see SSmass ).


Note that the minimal 4D curvature of a negative energy solution is .
For the critical zero energy solution , and strongineq 
implies , so . However, 
counterterms  shows that  such curvature is also the critical curvature 
where the derivative expansion of the effective
quantum field theory breaks down.
So the negative energy 
solutions to lie at the edge of the regime of validity of our theory.

Another way of arguing the same point is the following.
The instability appears for 4D energy density ).
Significantly, this is also the energy density of a gravitational
source for which the cubic interaction term in 3int  becomes comparable 
to the kinetic term of the scalar , defined in Section 3.
To see this, recall that   couples to the stress-energy 
tensor with strength  (see diag ).
Then, to linear order in the source, . 
Substituting this estimate into the cubic interaction term 3int  we have 
[m12]
L _bdy  T^ _^_.
This term becomes of the same order as the  kinetic term when
.
We conclude that the negative energy solutions appear only at the
edge of validity of the effective theory, and the theory with
cutoff of order  is safe from
instabilities.




Curved Backgrounds 

A noteworthy aspect of massive gravity is that when propagating on a curved
background, it behaves very differently than in flat space. 
In AdS space, there is no vDVZ  
discontinuity , while in dS a light massive graviton becomes a 
ghost . These unusual features find a simple explanation when massive
gravity is rendered covariant by adding a Goldstone vector . At linear order,  appears in the combination
. Here  
is the covariant derivative of 
the 4D background. The difference with flat space originates from the fact that
at nonzero cosmological constant , the kinetic term of the 
strongly-interacting scalar mode  inside , , 
receives a
contribution proportional to . This contribution suppresses the 
cubic interactions of  when , and makes the graviton a ghost
at small mass when  .

In DGP, we find an analogous phenomenon.
We first give a general argument, then consider two important special cases:
one with a boundary with de Sitter geometry, the other a
Randall-Sundrum model with a DGP kinetic term on the boundaries.

General Discussion 
We consider the linearized theory about a general 5D background metric
G_MN  = G _MN  + H_MN .
We generalize de Donder gauge to curved backgrounds
by adding the gauge fixing term
L _bulk,gf  = -M_5^3 G ^MN  F_M F_N,
where
F_M =  ^N H_MN  - 12  _M H,
where  is the covariant derivative associated with
the background metric .
The bulk equations of motion are then
 ^2 ( H_MN  - 12 G _MN  H ) = 0.
Following the discussion in the flat case, it is convenient to
parameterize the modes of  as follows.
For simplicity, we will give the discussion using Gaussian normal
coordinates for the background metric: ,
.
Instead of  and ,
we use as boundary variables
_ = _,
_5  = ,
where  satisfies the bulk equation
 ^2 _M = 0.
This implies that the mode

satisfies the bulk equations of motion as well as the de Donder
gauge fixing condition.
We then parameterize a general bulk fluctuation as
[general]
H_MN  = H_MN ^(2)  +  _(M  _N)  - H _MN ,
where 
 ^2 H^(2) _MN  = 0,
 ^2 H ^(2) _MN  = 0,
with boundary values
H_ ^(2)   = h_ ,
H_5 ^(2)   = 0,
H_5 5 ^(2)   = 0,
and
H _   =  _(  _)   
= D _(  _)  + 2 K _  _5,
H _5    = 0,
H _55   = 0,
where  is the covariant derivative with respect to the
induced background metric .
The  term in general 
subtracts the contribution
of the 'Goldstone' modes  to the fluctuations of the
induced boundary metric, which is then simply
, the 'spin 2' mode.
This ensures that  and  as defined above do not appear in
the large DGP kinetic term.
We will see that in terms of these variables, the identification of the
strong degrees of freedom is more direct. 
(Indeed, the combination  that diagonalizes the kinetic term 
in diag  in the flat case is precisely the 'Goldstone' .)

The dependence on  can be obtained simply by noting that  under
[symmetry]
h_  D _(  _) ,
__+ _,
,
the bulk fluctuation
general  changes precisely by a residual gauge transformation ,
satisfying , .
symmetry  is therefore a symmetry
of the quadratic boundary action.
Therefore, we can work out the action at  and restore the
dependence on  by the substitution
[xisub]
h_  h_  - D _(  _) .
We now compute the boundary action for the modes above.
For this we will need
[d5curved]
 _5 H^(2) _   -  h_ ,
 _5 _ -   _,
 _5  -  ,
valid for modes with 4D wavelengths smaller than the scale of curvature,
where
  = -D ^2 .
d5curved  follows from the fact that for small-wavelength fluctuations
the curvature is irrelevant, so the result must reduce smoothly to the flat case.
We will see how this arises in
an explicit calculation in the next subsection.
The contribution to the boundary effective action
from the bulk Einstein action is then
L _bdy, E   &= -M_5^3 h^ 
[ -  N ( K_  - _  K )
]_linearized 


bdycurveE 
&= --  M_5^3 [
12 h^  h_ 
- 12 h h
+ h^  D _D _- h D ^2 + ],
where we have omitted terms of order  and
 that are subleading at small 4D wavelengths.
The contribution from the bulk de Donder gauge fixing term is
L _bdy, bulkgf  &= -M_5^3 - 
( H_5M  F^M - 12 H F^5 )


&= M_5^3 -  [
-14 h h - (D ^D ^h_ 
- D ^2 h) 


bdycurvedD 
& + 2 ( K _  D ^D ^- K  D ^2 ) + ]
where
F_&= D ^(h_  - 2 K _  )
- 12 D _(h - 2 K  )
+ O (K ^2 , K  h),


F_5 &= 12   (h - 2 K  )
+ O (K ^2 , K  h),
and we again omit terms that are subleading at small 4D wavelengths.
At this point, it is trivial to include the mode  by the
substitution xisub .
Note that  mixes with  only via the linearized
Ricci scalar, so there is no mixing between  and ,
generalizing the result of flat case.

The full quadratic boundary action is therefore the sum of
bdycurveE  and bdycurvedD .
In the small wavelength approximation, the only relevant change
comes from the last two terms in bdycurvedD .
To understand what they imply, we consider for simplicity a
maximally symmetric background, for which
K _  = C  _ .
Adding the DGP kinetic term and diagonalizing the kinetic term for
 and  we obtain the  kinetic term
[ghost]
L _kin  = 3 M_4^2 m (m - 2C) D ^2 .
Note that the  mode becomes a ghost for .
We will see below that  for de Sitter space (see GKdSexplicit ).
Therefore, as in massive gravity, positive curvature increases the
strength of the strongest interactions, while negative curvature
decreases it.


One of the motivations for considering the DGP model is that it provides a
source of 'dark energy' in the absence of 4D vacuum energy.
In this case, we can compute the relation between the constant  introduced
above and the positive curvature of the present-day universe.
From bdyequ , we have
[mmm6]
4M^2_4 G _ ()
= T_  - 12M^3_5 C _  T_  - 4M^2_4 _now  _ .
This shows that  is positive, hence  is a ghost, for sufficiently 
small .
In the next subsection, we will see that in a DGP model with no cosmological
constant in the bulk,  is a ghost in the regime where 4D vacuum energy does
not contribute to the 4D curvature.
More generally, we expect that positive 4D curvature decreases the
strength of the  kinetic term, so that it makes the interactions of 
even stronger than on a Minkowsky 4D background. 
Conversely, a negative 4D curvature weakens the  self-interactions,
as in massive gravity.
When  is much smaller than the curvature , it even eliminates the vDVZ discontinuity already at 
linear order .  




Explicit Calculation: de Sitter Space 
We now consider the important special case of 4D de Sitter space in a
DGP model with vanishing bulk cosmological constant.
The solution has very simple 5D geometry:
the bulk is flat, and the boundary is at
_  x^x^+ y^2 = L^2
in Cartesian coordinates.
It is more convenient to use coordinates where the background metric is
[dSbackmet]
ds^2 = dr^2 - r^2 d^2 + r^2 ^2 d_3^2.
The boundary is at  in these coordinates.
The boundary equation is
4 M_4^2 G _ ()
- 4 M_5^2 [ K _  -  _  K  ]
= - V_0  _ ,
where  is the vacuum energy on the boundary.
It is straightforward to work out
[GKdSexplicit]
G _ () = -3 r^2   _ ,
K _  = +1 r   _ .
This gives the relation between the 4D vacuum energy and the
curvature:
V_0 12 M_4^2  L^2 + m L = 1.
For , this gives the usual relation between
vacuum energy and curvature, but for  we get
.
It is interesting that in this regime the 4D curvature is independent
of the vacuum energy, but from ghost  we see that the Goldstone is always
a ghost in this regime.

We now consider the explicit calculation of the boundary action.
To understand the strong interactions, it is sufficient to consider
the scalar modes
H_MN  = G _MN  + ( n _M  _N + n _N  _M )
+ n _M n _N ,
where  is the normal vector
,
.
A useful relation is
 _M n _N = 1r  _MN ,
where
 _MN  = G _MN  - n _M n _N
is the induced metric on surfaces of constant .

(We can think of  as a bulk scalar.
Geometrically, it is the proper distance of any point in the
bulk to the boundary.) 

The de Donder equations of motion for the scalar modes defined
above are
 _  (  ^2 + 2r^2  )
+ 4r  _ _&= 0,


 _[
 ^2 + 2r  _r - 4r^2  + 2r ] &= 0,


 ^2 +  ^2 + 2  _r (  ^2 - 4r^2  )
- 8r^2  &= 0.
In our coordinates
 ^2 = [ _r^2 + 4r _r 
+ 1r^2   _4 ] ,
where  is the Laplacian on .
Since  is independent of , we can treat it as a
parameter when solving the equations.
(More formally, we could expand in eigenstates of .)

The behavior of the solutions is very easy to understand once
we notice that they are homogeneous in .
The solutions therefore have the form
= ( rL )^A ,
= ( rL )^A + 1  ,
( rL )^A ,
where  depends on .
The solution is very simple for fluctuations with
 on the boundary.
(Recall that  is the size of the 4D universe!)
For these fluctuations  and the leading
terms in the equations that determine  are simply
A^2 +  _4 = 0,
with solution
.
Good behavior at infinity (away from the boundary)
requires the negative solution.
Since  is the only expansion parameter, the
corrections are
A = -- _4  [ 1 + O (1/  _4) ],
and so on the boundary
A  = - L   + O (1/L  ).
Note that the corrections to  are smaller than the  curvature
corrections described in the previous subsection.

The conclusions depend only on the fact that the equations are
second order and homogeneous in , and so hold for general
polarization states.
This shows that
_r H_MN   = -  H_MN  + O (H / L^3  ).
The remainder of the calculation follows the previous subsection
line by line.






DGP and Randall-Sundrum 
It is instructive to apply the results of the previous section 
to the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model  with a DGP boundary term added.
At the boundaries, we have
K _  = L  _ ,
where  is the bulk AdS curvature length, and
the  () sign corresponds to the IR (Planck) brane.

We first consider adding a DGP kinetic term on the Planck brane.
As long as , ghost  shows that the scale of strong
interactions is .
We conclude that the DGP kinetic term
does not lead to new strong interactions within the original
regime of validity of the RS model.
This is consistent with the holographic interpretation of the model
as a 4D conformal field theory (CFT) coupled to gravity.
The DGP kinetic term simply corresponds to a large coefficient for
the gravity kinetic term in the UV, large enough to dominate the 
induced contribution to the Planck scale from the CFT.
Note that the extrinsic curvature term in the boundary effective
action is crucial for obtaining this result.

We now consider adding a DGP kinetic term to the IR (or 'TeV') brane.
In this case, ghost  tells us that the theory has a ghost for
.
In fact, this instability comes from the radion itself becoming a
ghost.
To see this in a simple way, we consider the limit where the Planck
brane is pushed to the boundary of AdS and the IR brane is at fixed
position .
In this limit the 4D zero mode graviton is decoupled from the physics
on the IR brane.
The only zero mode is the radion , which can be parameterized by
ds^2 = e^2 k y  [ 1 + 2 (x) e^-2 k y  ]
dx_dx^+ [ 1 - 2 (x) e^-2 k y  ]^2 dy^2.
Its kinetic term is
L _kin  =
6 ( M_5^3 k  - 2 M_4^2 ) _4 ,
in agreement with ghost .

This is interesting because it prevents a geometrical construction of
a model with an isolated massive spin 2 particle.
This model has only massive spin 2 KK modes, and when
 one finds that the lightest spin 2 mode
has an anomalously small mass of order ,
while the remaining massive KK modes have mass of order .
If it were not for the instability, discussed above, for
 this model would reduce to an effective theory of a
single massive graviton (and a radion) below the scale .




Conclusions 

We now summarize our results.
First, we showed that the DGP model has strong interactions at distances
shorter than .
The strong interactions are due to a scalar 'Goldstone' mode that
obtains a kinetic term only by mixing with the transverse graviton
polarizations, similar to massive gravity.
The longitudinal Goldstone has a geometrical interpretation as a 
brane bending mode that keeps the induced metric on the brane fixed.
Second, we showed that there are classical instabilities in the DGP
model in the form of negative energy solutions.
These solutions are at the edge of validity of the effective field
theory with UV cutoff at the scale , giving further support
to the conclusion that new physics is required at this scale.
Finally, we considered the strong interactions in the presence of
4D and/or 5D curvature.
We showed that positive (de Sitter) sign curvature makes the model
more strongly interacting, and makes the strong mode a ghost for
sufficiently large curvature.
We also investigated the effect of a DGP kinetic term in the Randall-Sundrum
model.

We conclude with some comments on the solution of the vDVZ  
discontinuity problem suggested in ddgv .
There, it was shown that around a classical source of Schwarzschild radius 
, a careful resummation of non-linear effects restores the 
phenomenologically correct Schwarzschild solution
below a distance .
Now, the curvature of the Schwarzschild metric is of order
, so that at the distance  the curvature is of order
. 
From inspection of counterterms  we find that this is the 
critical curvature at which the quantum effective field theory breaks down.
Stated otherwise, at the scale , the effective quantum expansion parameter

becomes order 1.
Therefore, any statement about the behavior of the
field at distances smaller than  requires 
knowledge (or assumptions) about the UV completion of the  sector.

One possibility is to assume that when  the infinite series of 
counterterms saturates and the quantum correction to the effective action
stays of the order of the result at .
In this case, the contribution from the counterterms is suppressed compared
to the tree-level contribution (which has fewer derivatives)
by .
In this scenario, there is a range of scales where the effect of ddgv 
works.
In this case, one still has to find a way to avoid the instabilities associated
with curvature of order , found above.
Moreover, this does not rescue the model phenomenologically, since at least
at the length scale  km, gravity becomes sensitive to the
details of the UV completion.
