Abstract 
 
                                  Using the nonlinear realizations of the Virasoro group we
construct the action of the Conformal Quantum Mechanics (CQM) with
additional harmonic potential. We show that  invariance
group of this action is nontrivially embedded in the
reparametrization group of the time which is isomorphic to the
centerless Virasoro group. We generalize the consideration to the
Ermakov systems and construct the action for the time dependent
oscillator. Its symmetry group is also the 
group embedded in the Virasoro group in a more complicated way.

The Time Dependent Oscillator ( so called Ermakov system[1]) has
been the subject of vigorous research for decades because of its
relevance to a large variety of physical phenomena, especially due
to its elegant mathematical properties and application potential
of its invariant. The list is very exhaustive which include in
particular the study of soliton solutions of nonlinear evolution
equations, construction of time dependent integrals of
motion for the parametric harmonic oscillator used for the
canonical formulation of more general parametric systems and their
semiclassical quantization, theory of coherent and
squeezed states, Berry's phase, Noether's
theorem and Noether and Lie symmetries of the time dependent
Kepler system, anisotropic Bose-Einstein condensates and
completely integrable dynamical systems, cosmological
particle creation, scalar field cosmologies and
inflationary scenarios, nonlinear
optics, propagation of water waves, exact
solution for the Calogero system and non-central
potential with dynamic symmetry, study of motions in a
Paul trap, quantum mechanical description of highly
cooled atoms, emergence of non classical optical states
of light due to time-dependent dielectric constant,
particle distribution for beam in electric field,
nonlinear elasticity, molecular
structures, quantum field theory in curved
spaces, quantum cosmology, etc., among
others.


A vital modification of the Time Dependent Oscillator includes an
additional term in the potential proportional to the inverse
square of the coordinate - it is often referred to as the
anharmonic oscillator. This extra term is conformally invariant.
The analogous Conformal Quantum Mechanics (CQM) was investigated
in detail by De Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan. It was shown
in their paper that the consistent quantum treatment of the model
assumes the transition to the new time coordinate, which
transpires to be equivalent to the introduction of additional
oscillator-like term with a constant frequency in the potential.
Therefore the emerging physical Hamiltonian represents the
anharmonic oscillator with time independent frequency .

Another fascinating feature of Conformal Quantum Mechanics
(CQM), as well as its supersymmetric generalization -
SCQM-, is the fact that they are the simplest
theories that allow the cultivation and development of methods for
investigation of more complicated higher dimensional field
theories. One should also note that in spite of its simplicity,
SCQM describes the physical objects such as a particle near the
horizon of black hole, etc. The extended SCQM is also
closely related to the Calogero model with spin, which has
numerous physical applications.



The most adequate approach for understanding the geometrical
meaning of CQM and SCQM is the method of nonlinear realizations of
the symmetry groups underlying both theories - the group 
and its supersymmetrical generalizations  and
 respectively,. In spite of its
power, this method does not allow the possibility of including in
the Hamiltonian of the theory the oscillator-like potentials
introduced in. As will be shown in this paper the
explanation for this lies entirely in the fact that in the
presence of the oscillator-like term the invariance group of the
action, though being the Conformal Group, is realized by the more
complicated transformations. These transformations for the
constant , as well as for the time-dependent one (Ermakov
system), can naturally be embedded in the reparametrization group
of the time variable which is isomorphic to the centerless
Virasoro group. This embedding is rather nontrivial in the case of
nonvanishing .

The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we  apply
the nonlinear realizations method to the Virasoro group and its
three dimensional subgroup . We calculate the
transformation laws for parameters of these groups and construct
differential Cartan's Omega forms invariant under  these
transformations. They are then used for the construction of the
action for Conformal Quantum Mechanics in the Subsection 3.1. In
the Subsection 3.2 we illustrate the mechanism for the appearance
of the oscillator-like terms in the Omega-forms, and
correspondingly in the action. We show how the symmetry group of
this action, , is non-trivially embedded in the Virasoro
group. In Subsection 3.3 we generalize these results to the
Ermakov systems with time dependent oscillator frequency. We
describe also the transformations of the time and phase space
variables which connect with each other the Hamiltonians with
different values of the harmonic oscillator frequency, including
the free motion and Ermakov systems. Some further anticipations of
the formalism we developed are included in conclusions.



The generators of the infinitedimensional reparametrization
(diffeomorphisms) group on the line parametrized by some parameter
 are  and form the Virasoro algebra
without central charge  
If one restricts to the regular at the origin 
transformations, it is convenient to parametrize the Virasoro
group element as 
 where all multipliers, except the last one, are arranged by the
 conformal weight of the generators in the exponents.

The transformation laws of the group parameters  in
() under the left action
 
where infinitesimal element  belongs to the Virasoro algebra
 
are
 
where the infinitesimal function  is constructed out of
the parameters   
One can see from Transtau  that the parameter  transforms
precisely as the coordinate of the one-dimensional space under the
reparametrization. The parameters  and  transform
correspondingly as the dilaton and one-dimensional Cristoffel
symbol. In general the transformation rule for  contains
-st derivative of the infinitesimal parameter .

To make the connection with the physical models, it is natural to
consider all parameters  in coset1  as the
fields in one-dimensional space parametrized by the coordinate
.

The conformal group  in one dimension is a
three-parameters subgroup of coset1 , namely the one generated
by  and . Its group element is a product of
first two and last one multipliers in the expression coset1 
 
In other words, the  group is embedded in the Virasoro
group in the simplest way by the conditions
 
The infinitesimal transformation function  epsilon 
which conserves the conditions Conditions  contains only three
parameters
 

It is convenient to introduce new variables playing the roles of
the coordinate and momentum of the particle
 
for which the conformal group infinitesimal transformations are
 
with  given in this case by the expression
3parameter . The corresponding finite transformations are
 
with parameters of the transformation constrained by the
unimodularity condition .



The action integral for Conformal Mechanics 
The transformations CT  form a symmetry group of the Conformal
Quantum Mechanics of with the action
ActionAFF  S = 12  d( x ^2 -
x^2  ). As was shown in (see
also) this action can be naturally described on the
language of invariant differential Cartan's form
 
connected with the parametrization coset2  of the conformal
group. The explicit calculations give
 

All these differential forms are invariant under the
transformations CT  and can be used for construction of an
invariant action. The simplest one is the linear in -forms
combination 
The first term in this expression is appropriately normalized to
get the correct kinetic term. The parameter  plays the
role of cosmological constant in one dimension because
, which corresponds to the translation generator
, is the differential -form einbein.

The action BoseAction  is a first order representation of the
action describing the Conformal Mechanics of De Alfaro, Fubini and
Furlan. Indeed, one can find   by solving its
equation of motion, insert it back in the lagrangian and get the
second order action ActionAFF .

The action integral for Conformal Mechanics
with Additional Harmonic Potential  From the point of view of
underlying physics the action ActionAFF  is not satisfactory
one, because the corresponding quantum mechanical Hamiltonian does
not have the ground state. The modification of this action with
the appealing spectrum of the energy was considered in.
It includes the additional harmonic oscillator term
ActionAFFHarmonic  S_1 = 12  d(
x ^2 -  x^2 -^2 x^2 ). Though
the action ActionAFFHarmonic  contains the dimensional
parameter , it is invariant under the transformations of
conformal group, realized by the more complicated expressions, as
we will see.

As we have already mentioned in the Introduction, the action
ActionAFFHarmonic  can not be described in the framework of
nonlinear realizations of the  group, parametrized as in
coset2 . Instead, we will consider the embedding of this group
in the Virasoro group coset1  by conditions different from the
simplest ones Conditions . The structure of the component
 in the Cartan's Omega-form connected with the
Virasoro group
 
may serve as a hint in the choice of the appropriate conditions.
The components  and  coincide with the
corresponding components Cbose  and CartanC0 . Though the
components  depend in general on
all parameters , the component 
 
depends in addition to the phase space variables  only on
the parameter . So, the last term in the expression
CartanV1  is the only difference of it with respect to the
corresponding expression CartanC1  calculated for the
representation coset1  of the  group. Moreover, if we
take
 
we obtain exactly an oscillator-like term in the action
 
which coincides with the action  ActionAFFHarmonic  in the
second order form.

The component  CartanV1  by construction is
invariant under the arbitrary infinitesimal transformations
left1  of the Virasoro group if parameters  and 
transform according to the equations TransX , TransP  and
Trans2 . The consistency condition of this last transformation
law with the demand that  can be written in the form
 
The solution of this differential equation gives
 
So, the action of Conformal Mechanics ActionAFFHarmonic  with
additional oscillator-like potential is invariant under the three
parameter transformation ParOmegaConst .

The Time Dependent Oscillator 
In general the variable  can be arbitrary function of
the time. Nevertheless, the treating it as a dynamical variable
leads to the trivial dynamics because, as one can easily see from
the expression CartanV1 , it plays the role of a Lagrange
multiplier leading to the equation of motion (If
the variable  carries in addition some index  -
 the situation drastically changes when this
index describes the vector representation of the rotation group of
the space-time with the signature . In this case the action
is given by the sum of  expressions CartanV1  (with the
corresponding signs) and it describes the massless particle in 
- dimensional space-time (the spinning particle if
instead of the Virasoro group one considers the reparametrization
group in the superspace  with one bosonic and  Grassmann
coordinates))  So, instead of being the constant as in a
previous Subsection, the parameter  in a physical model can
be at most some fixed  function . If we are
looking for the invariance transformations of the action
OmegaAction  with the time dependent frequency 
(), it means that after the time
transformation Transtau  
the functional dependence should remain the same:

. The transformation law Trans2  leads then to the
equation for the infinitesimal parameter 
 
This differential equation of the third order with the time
dependent coefficients has the solution in the form 
where  are three infinitesimal constants and
functions  form the fundamental system of
solutions of auxiliary equation
 
For the time independent  this solution reproduces the
ones given by ParOmegaConst . For different particular forms of
the  the equation EqOmegaTime  becomes, for
example, the Lame, Matieu, Hill etc. equations, each of
which play the very important role in the physics.

So, the solution Solution  of the equation EqOmegaTime 
describe the invariance transformations of the action for the Time
Dependent Oscillator with the frequency .

The very important for the Time Dependent Oscillator model is the
question about its possible connection with other solvable systems
like Harmonic Oscillator or even with the free particle. Such
connection can in principle lead to the construction of exact
solutions of the Schro dinger equation for the Time Dependent
Oscillator starting from the solutions of these simpler systems.
The example of such connection was given in where the
transformation from the system with vanishing frequency
ActionAFF  to the one with constant 
ActionAFFHarmonic  was given. This transformation inevitably
includes the transformation of the time.

To construct the generalizations of this transformation let us
consider the most general finite transformation of the Virasoro
group 
If we start with , i.e. in the absence of the
oscillator like potential, the frequency of the induced harmonic
term in the new time will be given by the expression
 
which can be recognized as the Schwarz derivative of the
transformed time over the old ones. One can rewrite the equation
Freq  in the more familiar form
 
So, the solution  of the equation TintoTau  gives the
transformation rules TransGeneral1 -TransGeneral4  between
the two systems - the one without oscillator-like potential and
the others having in addition to the conformal potential 
 the term . One should note also that the
conformal potential term in the action is by itself invariant
under the arbitrary finite transformations
TransGeneral1 -TransGeneral2 .



Conclusions 
In this paper we applied the methods of nonlinear realizations
approach for construction of the actions of Conformal Quantum
Mechanics, as well, as the action of the Time Dependent
Oscillator. We have shown that both the actions are invariant
under the three parameter transformations which are nontrivially
embedded in the Virasoro group. We described also different types
of transformations belonging to the Virasoro group and making the
connections of different systems each with other. In particular,
we obtain such transformation between the free motion Hamiltonian
and Hamiltonian of the Time dependent Oscillator. It would be
interesting to carry up the analogous considerations in the more
complicated theories, such as  and  SuperConformal
Quantum Mechanics.
