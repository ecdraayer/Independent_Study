Therefore the Green function is
  where  is the bigger (smaller) of  and , 
are modified Bessel functions.
This Green function Satisfies Dirichlet boundary condition at
 and at . At the coincidence limit the Green
function is
 18 
G(x,x)=-2 m-2 x^1-m I_m-1 m-2   (2m-2  x^1-m2  )
K_m-1 m-2   (2m-2 x^1-m2  ).
  In terms of the scalar curvature , this
 relation becomes
 19 
 G(x,x)=-2 m-2 (mR(x) )^1-m 2-m  I_m-1 m-2   (2m-2  (R(x)m )^-12  )
K_m-1 m-2   (2m-2  (R(x)m )^-12  ).
  In the strong curvature limit, or in regions where (), by considering
 the asymptotic behavior of Bessel functions
 this relation becomes
 20 
 _R G(x,x)=-k+1k (R(x)m )^k,
  which is  independent as anticipated.  is defined after the equation ().
 In regions where the curvature is weak , we
 have
 21 
 G(x,x)=-12 (R(x)m )^m2(2-m) .
 Now we show the relation of electrostatic self-energy and
confinement. Assume that ; the energy needed to locate a
single charge  in the region  or 
(in the coordinate ()), is 22 
E_self. (x)=e' ^24 (R(x)m )^m2(2-m) ,which tends to infinity. In other words there is a great repulsive
force on an external charge near  prohibiting to have single
charges in this region. The same procedure occurs in the region
, for  (when ). So in these
regions following the equation () only charges forming
mesonic structure may survive. These two opposite charges must be
near together in order to obtain a finite energy for the system.
Note that our criterion for confinement is not based on the
behavior of the energy in the infrared (where the geodesic
distance of external charges tends to infinity).

A similar phenomenon (but not due to gravitational effects) occurs
in dual bag model. In that case quarks and anti-quarks must form
mesonic structure in order to avoid divergences in static
potential, i.e only color singlets have finite energy because the
divergence term appears as a multiplier of total external charges
. In our case besides this constraint, test charges
must be close together.

The repulsive forces on single charges besides the curvature of
the space-time is related to the boundary conditions imposed on
the gauge fields in defining the vacuum of the system. These
repulsive forces may also be arisen on a surface with constant
curvature (adS or dS space-times, obtained for example by taking
 in the previous example).

Maxwell field theory (disregarding vacuum polarization) in 2+1
dimensional conical space-times, despite the null curvature of
the manifold exhibits also a repulsive force on charges.

For Maxwell theory on a four dimensional Schwarzschild black-hole
a test charge near the horizon is repelled by an image charge
inside the horizon. In these case one must subtract the infinite
parts to obtain a renormalized Green function or the finite part
of self-energy. On a two dimensional static space-time, in
contrast to the Maxwell theory in three and four dimensions, as we
will discuss later,  electrostatic self-energy in  is a well
defined function.

In  Schwarzschild coordinate, we consider a non-extremal two
dimensional static black hole described by the metric 23 ds^2=f(r)dr^2-1f(r) dr^2. At the horizon ,
. In this coordinate the equation () becomes 24 (f(r)(d^2dr^2 )-^2)G(r,r')=f(r)(r,r').Near the (bifurcate)
horizon, i.e. , , we have ,
where  denotes the surface-gravity. Assuming the gauge
field tends to zero at infinity and is well behaved at the
horizon, the two point function of the gauge field becomes 25  G(r,r')=2(r_> -h)^12 (r_< -h)^12 K_1(2r_>-h  )I_1(2r_<-h  ),where  is the smaller (bigger) of  and
. The self energy near the horizon is then 26 
E_self. (x)=e'^2(r-h)K_1(2r-h  )I_1(2r-h  ).In
contrast to the four dimensional case, there is an attractive
force on the test charge near the horizon, which by considering
the asymptotic behavior of Bessel functions is independent of
vacuum polarization: this attractive force may be related to an
image charge inside the horizon, when these charges are near
together, that is near the horizon, the effect of vacuum
polarization may be disregarded (self-energy is independent of
). At the horizon the self-energy is zero, and in contrast
to the previous example ultraviolet behavior of the Green function
doesn't lead to charge confinement.
Heat kernel expansion of electrostatic self-energy 

In this part we study the short distance behavior of Green
function , using the heat kernel of positive elliptic
operator .  We write the
heat kernel in the form 27  h(;x,x')=_n=0 ^ ^(n-12 ) 4  (-2 -^2 )a_n(x,x'),which satisfies 28  Oh(;x,x')+h(;x,x') =0,where 
, is one half of the square
of geodesic distance between  and  and  is
the proper-time parameter.  is given by 29 G(x,x')=-_0 ^ h(;x,x')d,provided 30  h(0;x,x')=( x,x').Therefore 31 G(x,x')=-1  _n=0 ^(2^2 )^(n2 +14 ) K_n+12  (2 )a_n (x,x') and for ,32 
G(x,x)=-12  _n=0 ^ (^2)^-n-12  (n+12 )a_n(x,x),which is regular.

Under a scale transformation parameterized by the positive number
,
 
the Green function becomes
 
 or 
. We have written the  dependence of 
explicitly. Using ( ), we obtain 34 
a_n ()=a_n(^n-12    . Hence As a polynomial,  consists only of  power of 
(including also its derivatives), where .
In , the order of derivatives is . For example as we will
see, in , only the terms  and
 are present.

In order to obtain heat-kernel coefficients we use the relations
35 []=[ [^(2) ]=g (x), 
[^(3) ]=3g'4g  (x). We have shown 
 by  and  denotes the first derivative and
 the nth
 derivative with respect to .

By solving the equation () for the Seeley coefficients, we
obtain a recursion relation
 
For , . In order to satisfy () we must
have . Taking the
diagonal value of () yields 37 -12 g^-32  (x)g'(x)[a'_n ]+g^-12  (x)[a^(2) _n]-(n+1)[a_n+1 ]=0.For  38 [a_1]=-12 g^-32  (x)g'(x)[a'_0]+g^-12  [a_0^(2) ], hence 39 
[a_1]=-1164 g^-94  (x)g' ^2(x)+18 g^-54  (x)g^(2) (x).For  we require the
diagonal part of   derivatives:  and .
Differentiating () with respect to  gives
 
For  41  [a'_1]=-14 g^-94  (x)g'(x)g^(2) (x)+99512 g^-134  g' ^3+116 g^-54  (x)g^(3) (x).Another differentiation of
() with respect to  in the limit 
leads to the following equation
 
Therefore we find  
Equations (), ( ), () yield
 
One can continue this method to obtain other .
Heat kernel
coefficient can be expressed in terms of the scalar curvature

 and  (at the
horizon of a black-hole,  is the surface -gravity).
 

Hence the self-energy of the charge  up to the fourth
adiabatic order is
 

Note heat kernel expansion like the WKB method can not be applied
at the horizon ,  i.e. where . To obtain an expression
for the self energy near the horizon one can expand the metric and
follows the steps after the equation (). For example
Considering asymptotic behavior of Bessel function for large
arguments in equation () gives the first term in equation
(). This is similar to the relation of Airy functions and
the WKB solutions in solving the Schrodinger equation for a slowly
varying potential. The first term of () is also the same
as () obtained in weak curvature limit. Note that in the
flat case () and therefore the self energy of test charge
in our previous examples tends to the well known result
