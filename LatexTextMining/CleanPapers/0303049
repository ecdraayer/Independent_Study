We derive the Lagrangian and the transformation laws of 
gauged supergravity coupled to matter multiplets whose
-model of the scalars is 
 and which
corresponds to the effective Lagrangian of the Type IIB string
compactified on the  with fluxes turned on and
in presence of  -branes. The gauge group is 
 where  is the gauge group on the brane and  is the
gauge group
on the bulk corresponding to the gauged translations of the R-R scalars coming from the R-R four-form.

The  bulk sector of this theory can be obtained as a
truncation of the Scherk-Schwarz spontaneously broken 
supergravity. Consequently the full bulk spectrum satisfies quadratic and quartic mass sum rules,
identical to those encountered in Scherk-Schwarz reduction gauging a flat group.

This theory gives rise to a no scale supergravity extended with
partial super-Higgs mechanism.









Introduction 
In recent time, compactification of higher dimensional theories in presence of -form fluxes- has given origin to new four-dimensional vacua with spontaneously broken supersymmetry and with vanishing vacuum energy. These models realize, at least at the classical level, the no-scale structure- of extended supergravities in an  or String theory setting- .

No-scale supergravities also arise from Scherk-Schwarz generalized dimensional reduction-, where a flat group is gauged.

From a pure four-dimensional point of view all these models can be viewed as particular cases of gauged-extended supergravities (for recent reviews see-). The gauge couplings correspond to fluxes turned on(Note that in String and  theories the fluxes satisfy some quantization conditions-) . This is so because for  supersymmetry a scalar potential is necessarily due to the presence of gauge symmetries. It has been shown  that a common feature of all no-scale structures is that the complete gauge group of the theory contains a sector where "axionic" symmetries are gauged -.

The Higgs effect in this sector is then tightly connected to the super-Higgs mechanism,. The complete gauge group is usually larger than this sector and the additional gauge bosons are frequently associated to central charges of the supersymmetry algebra.

For instance, in  spontaneously broken supergravity a la
Scherk-Schwarz, the translational part  is
27-dimensional and the extra sector  is one-dimensional,
then completing a 28-dimensional flat group
, [T_L,T_0]=f_L0 ^ T_ ;[T_L,T_ ]=0;,27This algebra is a 28-dimensional subalgebra
of . In the case of the IIB orientifold
, the translational part  is
12-dimensional, while the extra sector  are the Yang-Mills
generators on the brane,,
 [T_L,T_i]=0;[T_L,T_ ]=0;[T_i,T_j]=c_ij ^q q k T_k;12; i,j,k=1dimGWhat is common to these groups is that they must have a symplectic action on the vector field strengths and their dual. This implies that they must be embedded in , where  in the orientifold case.

The particular choice of the embedding determines the structure of the gauged supergravity. In the case of the type IIB supergravity in presence of -branes, the strong requirement is that the original  symmetry acts linearly on the twelve bulk vectors , , but acts as an electric magnetic duality on the vectors ,  living on the -branes are the   doublet N-S and R-R two-forms with one leg on space-time and one leg on the torus .

Mathematically this corresponds to a very particular embedding of  into .

The relevant decomposition is
 
where  (note
that if , then ). The symplectic embedding
of the  vectors such that  is
diagonal on 12 vectors and off diagonal in the remaining
Yang-Mills vectors on the branes, is performed in section 3.

Interestingly, the full bulk sector of the  Type
IIB orientifold can be related to a  truncation of the 
spontaneously broken supergravity a la Scherk-Schwarz
,. This
will be proven in detail in Section 8.

The  -symmetry of the Type IIB theory is
identified with the  of the 
theory, while  is
related to the subgroup of 
. The  truncation is obtained
by deleting the left-handed gravitino in the 
 and keeping the  in the
decomposition of the  of  into 
 irreducible representations: 

.

The  gravitino mass matrix (the  of )
decomposes as follows 36 1 ^0+15 ^0+10 ^+1 +10 ^ -1  and the
representation  corresponds to the  gravitino
mass matrix of the orientifold theory,.

The vacuum condition of the  Scherk-Schwarz model
corresponds to the vanishing of a certain representation 
 of ,
. Its  decomposition is 42 20 ^0+1 ^+2 +1 ^-2 +10 ^ +1 +10 ^-1  and the vacuum
condition of the  orientifold theory corresponds to setting
to zero, the
representation  (the other representations being
deleted in the truncation).

This theory has a six-dimensional moduli space (,  being the dimensional of the Cartan subalgebra of ,
 if the -brane coordinates are added) which is locally three copies of ,
,. The spectrum depends on the overall scale
 , where  is the Kahler potential of the moduli space.
 In units of this scale, if we call   the four gravitino masses, the overall
 mass spectrum has a surprisingly simple form, and in fact it coincides with a particular truncation (to half of the states) of the  spectrum of Scherk-Schwarz spontaneously broken supergravity.

The mass spectrum satisfies the quadratic and quartic relations:
&&_J (2J+1)(-1)^2J m_J^2=0

&&_J (2J+1)(-1)^2J m_J^4=0 These relations imply that
the one-loop divergent contribution to the vacuum energy is
absent, in the field theory approximation,
. In the present investigation we complete the analysis
performed in reference,
. In these previous works the part referring
to the bulk sector of the theory and the vacua in presence of
-branes degrees of freedom were obtained.

The paper is organized as follows:

In Section 2 we describe the  -model geometry of the
bulk sector coupled to  -branes.

In Section 3 we give in detail the symplectic embedding which
describes the bulk IIB theory coupled to -brane gauge fields.

In Section 4 the gauging of the  theory is given.

In Section 5 the Lagrangian (up to four fermions terms) and the
supersymmetry transformation laws (up to three fermions terms) are
obtained.

In Section 6 the potential and its extrema are discussed.

In Section 7 the mass spectrum is given.

In section 8 we describe the embedding of our model in the 
supergravity and its relation with the Scherk-Schwarz
compactification.

In Appendix A we describe the geometric method of the Bianchi
identities in superspace in order to find the supersymmetry
transformation laws on space-time.

In Appendix B we use the geometric method (rheonomic approach)in
order to find a superspace Lagrangian which reduces to the
space-time Lagrangian after suitable projection on the
space-time.

In Appendix C we give a more detailed discussion of the freezing
of the moduli when we reduce in steps
 using holomorphic coordinates
on the  torus.

In Appendix D we give some conventions.





The Geometry of the scalar sector of the // orientifold in presence of -branes 
The -model of the bulk supergravity sector 


For the sake of establishing notations, let us first recall the
physical content of the  matter coupled supergravity
theory.
 The gravitational multiplet is
V^a_;_A ;^A_;A_1 ^I ;^A;_A;_1;_2where  and  are chiral and antichiral
gravitini, while  and  are chiral and antichiral
dilatini;  is the vierbein, ,  are
the graviphotons and the complex scalar fields 
satisfy the
constraint .

We also introduce  Yang-Mills vector multiplets, from which
 will be considered as vector multiplets of the bulk, namely
A_2 ^I ;^I_A;^IA ;s^rwhere  and
 are respectively chiral and antichiral gaugini,
 are matter vectors and ,  are real
scalar fields.

Correspondingly we denote the  vector multiplets, which
microscopically live on the -branes, as
A_ ^i;^i_A;^iA ;q^I_iwhere .
It is well known that the scalar manifold of the
 supergravity coupled to  vector multiplets is given by
the coset space,SU (1,1) U (1) SO (6,6+n) SO (6)SO (6+n) Denoting by , the weights
of the fields under the  factor of the 
-symmetry, the weights of the chiral spinors
are(Throughout the paper lower  indices
belong to the fundamental representation, while upper 
 indices belong to its complex conjugate) 
 
and for the  scalars we have w[_1]=w[_2]=-1;w[ _1]=w[ _2]=1Let us now
describe the geometry of the coset -model.

For the  factor of the 
-model we use the following parameterization
:
 
Introducing the 2-vector
 
w[L^]=-1;w[^]=1   the
identity 
becomes:
 
The indices  are lowered by the Ricci tensor
, namely:
 
A useful parametrization of the  coset
is in terms of the N-S, R-R string dilatons of Type IIB theory
 _2 _1 =i-S i+S with , from which follows
&&_1=-1 2 [i(e^ +1)+C]e^- 2  

&&_2=1 2 [i(e^ -1)+C]e^- 2   We will also use the isomorphism 
 realized with the Cayley matrix 
 

 

We note that the 2-vector   transform as a
vector of  on the left and 
 on the right. Indeed:
 

The left-invariant Lie algebra valued 1-form of is
defined by:

 

where the coset connection 1-form  and the vielbein 1-form
 are given by:
 
 Note that we have the
following relations
 



To discuss the geometry of the 
 -model, it is convenient to consider
first the case , that is the case when only six out the
 vector multiplets are present (no -branes). This case
was studied in reference.

In this case the coset reduces to 
 ; with respect to the subgroup 
 the 
generators decompose as follows:
dec0 (6,6)=(6,)+(1,1)+15 ^'+2 +15 ^-2 where the superscripts refer to the  grading. We
work in the basis where the  invariant metric has
the following form

 
Thus, the generators in in the right hand side of ()
are:
 
where we have defined:
 
and  are the  generators. It is useful
to split the scalar fields  into those which span the 
 submanifold and which
parametrize the corresponding coset representative 
 from the axions parametrizing the 
translations. We indicate them respectively with 
,  symmetric 
matrices
 and with 
, , .
Note that the capital Greek indices refer to global 
while the capital Latin indices refer to local 
transformations.
 The coset
representatives  and the full coset
representative  can thus be constructed as follows:
 
Note that the coset representatives  are orthogonal with
respect to the metric eta6 , namely .

The left invariant 1-form  satisfying
 turns out to be
 
As usual we can decompose the left invariant 1-form into the
connection , plus the vielbein :  The matrices  are the generators of the isotropy group
,
 where we have indicated with  the semisimple part
 of the -symmetry group  and with   the "matter group".

Since we are also interested in the connection of the diagonal
subgroup , we will use in the following two
different basis for the generators, the first one that makes
explicit the direct product structure of the isotropy group
(Cartan basis) and the latter in which we identify the diagonal
subgroup of the two factors (diagonal basis). We have
respectively:
 
where  is the generator of the diagonal 
 of  and
 is the generator of the orthogonal complement. The two
basis are related by
  where  is the matrix:
 
In the diagonal basis we can extract the connections 
and  of the diagonal  subgroup
and of its orthogonal part by tracing with the 
generators or, more simply, by decomposing  into its
antisymmetric part, giving the connection, and its symmetric part
giving the vielbein. In the following we will write  and
 as follows: (d) +o^(d) =1 2 
 
 
The vielbein  is, by definition 
 so that we get

 
where
  
In particular:
 
In this basis the Maurer-Cartan equation
 
take the form:
  
 where  is the   covariant
derivative and  is the  curvature: R^(d)IJ =d^IJ +^IK _K^J 
The usual Cartan basis (-basis) where the connection is
block-diagonal and the vielbein is block off-diagonal is
obtained by rotating  with the matrix . We find: = =
 
where   and  are the connections of 
and  respectively, while 
  is the vielbein. In this case the
the curvature of the 
 manifold takes the form: R =
   where:
 
 and
the vanishing torsion equation is
 



Geometry of the -model in presence of  -branes 

We now introduce additional  Yang-Mills multiplets
, ,
 
.

The isometry group is now 
 and the coset representative  factorizes
in the product of the 
 coset representative  and the 
 coset representative : L  = SL
In the following we shall characterize the matrix form of the
various  generators in the  and
define the embedding of 
inside .
 With respect to the subgroup
 the
 generators decompose as follows:
 
where the superscript refers to the 
grading. Let us choose for the  invariant metric
 the following matrix :   where the blocks are defined by the
decomposition of the  into .
The generators in in the right hand side of () have the
following form:  sl (6,R ):
(A & 0 & 00 & - A^T &00& 0 & 0
 );
so (1,1):(& 0 & 00 & -&00&
0 & 0  ) (15^,1) ^+2 :
T_[] =(0 & t_[]  & 00
& 0 &00& 0 & 0  );(15,1) ^-2 :(T_[] )^T  (6^,n) ^+1 :T_(i) =(0 & 0 &
t_(i) 0 & 0 &00& (t_(i) )^T & 0
 );(6,n) ^-1 :(T_(i) )^T
 where we have used the following notation: t_[]  ^  =
^ _ ;t_(i)  ^k =_^_i ^k

,=1,,6;i,k=1,,n  As in the preceding
case, we split the scalar fields into those which span the 
 submanifold  and which
parametrize the corresponding coset representative 
 from the axions parametrizing the 
 translations. We indicate them as before
respectively with ,  
 and . In
presence of -branes we have in addition the generators in
the   that we parametrize with  the
 matrices  (in the following
we will also use the notation  ). The
coset representatives  and  can
thus be constructed as follows:
 
where the sum over repeated indices is understood and  are  matrices.

As in the preceding case,  and 
 are. Note that the coset representative  is
orthogonal respect the metric .

The left invariant 1-form  turns out to be:
 
Proceeding as before we can extract, from the left invariant
1-form, the connection and the vielbein decomp  in the basis
where we take the diagonal subgroup  inside
, where now  are the
generators of 
. It is sufficient to take the antisymmetric and symmetric
part of  corresponding to the connection and the vielbein
respectively. We find:
 
where   From the
Maurer-Cartan equations
 
we derive the expression of the curvatures and the equations
expressing the absence of torsion in the diagonal basis:
 
while equations mauca1 , mauca3  remain unchanged.

Note that, as it is apparent from equation omega3 , the
connection of  is zero in this gauge: . To
retrieve the form of the connection in the Cartan basis it is
sufficient to rotate  and , given in equation
omega3 , by the generalized  matrix matD 
 
We find
 
 

 
 and
the vanishing torsion equation is
 



The symplectic embedding and duality rotations  Let us now discuss the
embedding  of the isometry group 
 inside . We start
from the embedding in which the  is
diagonal(The signs in the embedding  of 
 have been chosen in such a way that the action
on the doublet charges in the final embedding  were
the same as .) :
 
where each block of the symplectic matrices is a 
 matrix. In this embedding a generic symplectic section has
the following grading structure with respect to
:
 
where  and  are six dimensional vectors
while  and  have dimension . Identifying the
's with the electric field strengths and the 's with their
magnetic dual, we note that the embedding  basis1 
corresponds to the standard embedding where 
 acts as electric-magnetic duality while 
 is purely
electric.

We are interested in defining an embedding  in
which the generators in the  act as
nilpotent off diagonal matrices or Peccei-Quinn generators and
the  group has a block diagonal action on
the  and  components and an off
diagonal action on the  and  components.

Indeed, our aim is to gauge (at most) twelve of the fifteen
translation generators in the representation 
 and a suitable subgroup .

The symplectic transformation  which realizes this
embedding starting from the one in () is easily found
by noticing that  and 
 transform in the  and
 with respect to 
 respectively. Therefore we define the new
embedding:
 
In this embedding the generic  element
 has the following form:  
while the generic element of 
 takes the form   The product
 of these two matrices gives
the desired embedding in  of the
relevant coset. If we write the 
matrix in the form
  and define f=1 2  (A-iB);h=1 2  (C-iD) we obtain f=1 2 
 

h=1 2    The kinetic matrix of
the vectors is defined as,  and we find
 
or in components

  where we
have used the relation procione .

The Gauging 

Our aim is to gauge a group of the following form:
 
where  denote 12 of the 
Peccei-Quinn translations  in 
 and the group  is in general a compact semisimple
subgroup of  of dimension . In particular if
 we must have . The gauge group is a
subgroup of the global symmetry group of the ungauged action
whose algebra, for the choice of the symplectic embedding defined
in the previous section, is:
 
We note that the maximal translation group  which can be
gauged is of dimension twelve since the corresponding gauge vector
fields are  belong to the 
 of 
. Let us denote the gauge generators of the
 factor by , corresponding to the
gauge vectors  and by  () those
of the  factor associated with the vectors . These two
sets of generators are expressed in terms of the 
 generators  and of
the  generators  respectively by means of
suitable embedding matrices  
 and :
 
where  are the structure constants of , with 
 completely antisymmetric. The constants 
 are totally antisymmetric in
 as a consequence both of supersymmetry and
gauge invariance or, in our approach, of the closure of the
Bianchi identities. They transform therefore with respect to

 in the . Note
that  are the remnants in 
of the
fluxes of the Type IIB three-forms.

We may identify the scalar fields of the theory with the elements
of the coset representative  of 
 namely, , ,
. The scalar field associated with the coset 
 is
instead represented by the complex 2-vector
 satisfying the constraint procione .

The gauging can be performed in the usual way replacing the
coordinates differentials with the gauge covariant differentials
:
 
Note that  are the constant components of the
translational Killing vectors in the chosen coordinate system,
namely , where the couple  are
coordinate indices while  are indices in the adjoint
representation of the gauge subgroup ; in the same way
the Killing vectors of the compact gauge subgroup  are given by
 where the couple  are
coordinate indices, while  are in the adjoint representation
of .

From equations coorgau1 -coorgau3  we can derive the
structure of the gauged left-invariant 1-form 
 
where  and  are the shifts of 
due to the gauging of  and  respectively. From these
we can compute the shifts of the vielbein and of the connections.
We obtain:
 
where
 
Note that only the antisymmetric part of  is shifted,
while the diagonal connection  remains untouched.
An important issue of the gauging is the computation of the
"fermion shifts", that is of the extra pieces appearing in the
supersymmetry transformation laws of the fermions when the gauging
is turned on. Indeed the scalar potential can be computed from the
supersymmetry of the Lagrangian as a quadratic form in the
fermion shifts. The shifts have been computed using the (gauged)
Bianchi identities in superspace as it is explained in Appendix A.
We have:
 
where we have used the selfduality relation (see Appendix D for
conventions)  and
introduced the quantities F^IJK =1 2 (F^IJK i^*F^IJK )C^IJK =1 2 (C^IJK i^*C^IJK )where

to decompose the 24 dimensional representation of

The space-time Lagrangian and the associated supersymmetry
transformation laws, have been computed using the geometric
approach in superspace. We give in the Appendices A and B a
complete
derivation of the main results of this section.

In the following, in order to simplify the notation, we have
suppressed the "hats" to the gauged covariant quantities:
.

In particular, the gauged covariant derivatives on the spinors of
the gravitational multiplet and of the Yang-Mills multiplets are
defined as follows:
 
 is the gauged covariant derivative with respect to all
the connections that act on the field, while  is the
Lorentz covariant derivative acting on a generic spinor 
as follows
  The action
of the  connection  q0  appearing in the
covariant derivative  is defined as a consequence of the
different  weights of the fields pesos .


 The complete action is:
 
where
 
where
 
where, using equations p0 , p1 , p2 , p3  we have:
 
where 

 

 

 

The structures appearing in  and
 are given by
 

The Lagrangian is invariant under the following supersymmetry
transformation laws:

 
where we have definedqu  q^I_i=E^I_La^_I
The scalar potential and its extrema 
From the expression of the potential given in the Lagrangian
lagpot  and using the fermionic shifts given in equations
shgrav -shgaui , one obtains that the potential is given
by a modulus square, that is: V=1 12 F^IJK- +C^IJK- ^2+1 8 L_2c_ijk q^jJ q^kK ^2where  has been defined in equation qu .
 We note that
using the decomposition Z^IB _A =Z_A^IB(20 ) -1 6 (^I)_A^ C 
Z_CB ^(4 ) in equation lagpot  the
contribution of the gravitino shift  cancel against the
contribution  of the representation
 of the gaugino so that the bulk part of the
potential is proportional to .

We now discuss the extrema of this potential. Since  is
positive semidefinite, its extrema are given by the solution of
, that is L_2c_ijk q^jJ q^kK =0,F^IJK- +C^IJK- =0In absence of fluxes , the
only solution is that the  belong to the
 Cartan subalgebra of , then , but all the moduli of the orientifold are not
  stabilized as well as the . In this case the moduli space is
SU (1,1) U (1) SO (6,6+N) SO (6)SO (6+N) where  is the
 dimension of the Cartan subalgebra of .

In presence of fluxes,  we have, besides  belonging
to the Cartan subalgebra of , also  .
The latter equation, for arbitrary values of the gravitino masses
, , , , stabilizes the 
 complex modulus of  as well as all the moduli 
 except three diagonal ones such that
E^I_L=diag ( e^_1 , e^_2 , e^_3 ,
e^_1 , e^_2 , e^_3  )The meaning of
the previous result is as follows: let us call  the
(inverse) metric moduli of  in 
and  the 15 axions with enlarge 
 to . Using
complex coordinates (see Appendix C) ,
, then 
 and
, . The
frozen moduli from the  condition are all the
 and  except the diagonal ones
. Correspondingly, in the   sector,
all  and  are frozen, except the
diagonal  that are eaten by the 12 bosons
through the Higgs mechanism. Indeed the three diagonal
 are inert under gauge transformation (see
Appendix C). The full moduli space of a generic vacuum with
completely broken supersymmetry contains  moduli which
parametrize three copies
of  spaces.

Let us consider now the situation of partial supersymmetry
breaking ( for a more detailed discussion see Appendix C). If we
set  we have  supersymmetry and the equation 
 freezes all  moduli but none of the
. Correspondingly there are six massive
vectors whose longitudinal components are the  axions.
The moduli space of metric  is nine
dimensional and given by ;
adding the nine uneaten  axions the total
moduli space is .
Further adding the  Cartan moduli,
the complete moduli space is .

If we now set , i.e.  unbroken supersymmetry the
equation  fixes all  and  
except the diagonal ones and  . There are 10
massive vectors which eat all  moduli and
 except the diagonal ones and
; the moduli space is 

. This space is the product of the one-dimensional
Kahler manifold and the two-dimensional quaternionic manifold
as required by  supergravity. By further adding the 
Cartan moduli,
the moduli space enlarges to  .

Finally in the case of  unbroken supersymmetry, ,
the frozen moduli are the same as in the  case, and the moduli space
is indeed the product of three copies of Kahler-Hodge manifolds, as appropriate to chiral multiplets.




The mass spectrum 
The spectrum of this theory contains 128 states (64 bosons and 64
fermions) coming from the bulk states of IIB supergravity and
 states coming from the  -branes. The brane sector
is  supersymmetric. The bulk part has a mass spectrum which,
in units of the overall Kahler potential  of
the moduli space 
, has a surprisingly simple form:
 Fermions (4)&spin3 2 &m_i  i=1,2,3,4

2(4)&spin1 2 &m_i

(16)&spin1 2 &m_im_jm_ki<j<k
 Bosons (12)&spin 1&m_im_ji<j

(6)&spin 0&m=0

(12)&spin 0&m_im_j

(8)&spin 0&m_1m_2m_3m_4 This spectrum
(Note that we have corrected a mistake in the spin 1 mass
formula (5.21)-(5.23) as given in reference
) , in terms of the gravitino masses  (here related to the three-form fluxes as shown
in Appendix C) is identical to a truncation (to half of the states) of the mass spectrum of the  spontaneously
broken supergravity a la Scherk-Schwarz-.

The justification of this statement in given in the next
section.

We now note some properties of the spectrum. For arbitrary values
of  the spectrum satisfies the quadratic and quartic mass
relations _J (2J+1)(-1)^2J m_J^2k =0k=1,2Note that, in proving the above relations, the mixed terms for  are of the form  and they separately
cancel for bosons and fermions, due to the symmetry  of the spectrum. On the other hand, for 
 the mixed terms  are even in  and thus cancel between bosons and fermions.

If we set some of the  we recover the spectrum of  supersymmetric phases.

If we set  for some  we we recover some unbroken gauge symmetries. This is impossible with
the  phase (when ) but it is possible in the  phases. For instance in the  phase, for
 and  there is an additional massless vector multiplet, while in the  phase, for ,
 there are three massless vector multiplets and finally for the  phase and all  equal,
there are six massless vectors.

The spectrum of the -brane sector has an enhanced 
supersymmetry, so when the gauge group is spontaneously broken to
its Cartan subalgebra ,
 charged gauge bosons become massive and they are
 BPS saturated multiplets of the  superalgebra
with central charges (the fermionic sector for the brane gaugini
is discussed at the end of Section 8).
The residual  Cartan multiplets remain massless and their scalar partners complete the  dimensional moduli space of the theory, that is classically given by three copies of .

Adding all these facts together we may say that the spectrum is classified by the following quantum numbers , where  are "charges" of all type, , , ,  and  are the  charges of the  root-lattice. In the supergravity spectrum there is a sector of the type  (the 128 states coming from the bulk) and a sector of the type  (the sector coming from the -brane).

Since general duality transformation will mix these states, one expects, on general ground, more general massive states
where both quantum numbers are non vanishing.

Embedding of the  model with six matter multiplets in the  

There are two inequivalent ways of embedding the  model with
an action which is invariant under global 
, within the 
theory. They correspond to the two different embeddings of the
 symmetry of
the  action inside  which is the global
symmetry group of the  field equations and Bianchi
identities.The  model describes the low energy limit of
Type II superstring theory compactified on a six torus . As
shown in
 the ten dimensional origin of the 70 scalar
fields of the model can be characterized group theoretically once
the embeddings of the isometry group  of the
moduli space of  and of the duality groups of higher
dimensional maximal supergravities are specified within 
. This analysis makes use of the solvable Lie
algebra representation  which consists in describing the scalar
manifold as a solvable group manifold generated by a solvable Lie
algebra of which the scalar fields are the parameters. The
solvable Lie algebra associated with  is defined
by its Iwasawa decomposition and is generated by the seven Cartan
generators and by the 63 shift generators corresponding to all
the positive roots. In this representation the Cartan subalgebra
is parametrized by the scalars coming from the diagonal entries
of the internal metric while all the other scalar fields are in
one to one correspondence with the  positive
roots. We shall represent the   Dynkin diagram as
in figure .

 roots, while the filled circle denotes the  
 spinorial weight.

 and 
 Dynkin diagrams. The root
 is the  highest root while  is
. The group 
 is the symmetry group of the ten
dimensional type IIB theory. The positive roots are expressed as combinations
 of the simple roots in which
the positive integers  define the grading  of the root
 with respect to . The isometry group of the
 moduli space  is defined by the sub-Dynkin
diagram  while the Dynkin diagram
of the duality group  of the maximal supergravity
in dimension  is obtained from the 
Dynkin diagram by deleting the simple roots 
. Using these conventions in Table
 the correspondence
between the 63 non dilatonic scalar fields deriving from
dimensional reduction of type IIB theories and positive roots of
 is illustrated.

Correspondence between
the 63 non dilatonic scalar fields from type IIB string theory on
 (,  and 
) and positive roots of  according to the
solvable Lie algebra formalism. The  Peccei-Quinn scalars
correspond to roots with grading 1 with respect to ,
namely those with  and  which are marked by an
arrow in the table. 
 
  
In this framework the R-R scalars, for instance, are defined by
the positive roots which are spinorial with respect to 
, i.e. which have grading  with respect to the
spinorial simple root . On the contrary the NS-NS
scalars are defined by the roots with .Let us
first discuss the embedding of the 
 duality group of our model within .
 In the solvable Lie algebra language the
Peccei-Quinn scalars parametrize the maximal abelian ideal of the
solvable Lie algebra generating the scalar manifold. As far as the
manifold  is
concerned, this abelian ideal is 15 dimensional and is generated
by the shift operators corresponding to positive 
roots with grading one with respect to the simple root placed at
one of the two symmetric ends of the corresponding Dynkin diagram
. Since in our model the Peccei-Quinn scalars are of
R-R type, the  duality group embedded in 
 does not coincide with . Indeed one of
its symmetric ends should be a spinorial root of 
. Moreover the  group
commuting with  should coincide with the 
 symmetry group of the ten dimensional
type IIB theory, whose Dynkin diagram consists in our formalism
of the simple root . This latter condition uniquely
determines the embedding of  to be the one defined
by 
,
where  is
the spinorial root (see figure ).  On the other hand
the 20 scalar fields parametrizing the manifold 
 are all of NS-NS type (they come
from the components of the  metric). This fixes the
embedding of  within 
which we shall denote by : its Dynkin
diagram is . The
Peccei-Quinn scalars are then defined by the positive roots with
grading one with respect to the spinorial end  of 
  which is not contained in . In
table  the scalar fields in 
 which are not dilatonic
(i.e. do not correspond to diagonal entries of the  metric)
correspond to the  positive roots which
are characterized by  and are the off-diagonal
entries of the internal metric. The Peccei-Quinn scalars on the
other hand correspond to the roots with grading one with respect
to , which in table  are those with
 and indeed, as expected, are identified with the
internal components of the type IIB four form.
The above analysis
based on the microscopic nature of the scalars present in our
model has led us to select one out of two inequivalent embeddings
of the  group within 
which we shall denote by  and 
. The former corresponds to the  Dynkin
diagram running from  to  while the latter to
the  diagram running from  to . The 
 symmetry group of our  Lagrangian is
uniquely defined as part of the maximal subgroup 
 of 
 (in which  represents an
enhancement of 
) with respect to which the relevant
 representations branch as follows:
 
Moreover with respect to the 
subgroup of 
 the relevant  representations
branch in the following way:
 
The group  on the other hand is
contained inside both  and 
 as opposite to 
. As a consequence of this it is possible in
the  theory to choose electric field strengths and their
duals in such a way that 
 is contained in the global symmetry group of
the action while this is not the case for the group 

. Indeed as it
is apparent from eq. () the electric/magnetic charges
in the  of  do not branch  with respect
to  into two 28 dimensional reducible
representations as it would be required in order for 
 to be contained in the symmetry group of the
Lagrangian. On the other hand the group 

 can be
contained in the symmetry group of the  action for a certain
choice of the electric and magnetic field strengths, since with
respect to it the  branches as follows (the grading as
usual refers to the  factor):
 
In truncating to the  model the charges in the 

 are projected out and the symmetry group of the
Lagrangian is enhanced to 
.

The masses in the  theory with
gauged Peccei-Quinn isometries and  weights  As we
have seen, in the  theory with gauged Peccei-Quinn
isometries, the parameters of the effective action at the origin
of the scalar manifold are encoded in the tensor
. The condition for the origin to be an
extremum of the potential constrains the tensor in the following
way:
 
therefore all the independent gauge parameters will be contained
in the combination 
transforming in the  with respect to 
and in its complex conjugate which belongs to the 
. Using the gamma matrices each of these two tensors can
be mapped into  symmetric complex matrices:
 
where the matrix  is proportional to the gravitino mass
matrix . If we denote by  a generic generator of
 we may formally build the representation of a
generic   generator in the :
 
The  group in  is generated by .
Under a  transformation  the matrix B transforms as follows:
 
Therefore using  transformations the off diagonal generators in the  can be brought to the following form
 
where the phases and thus the signs of the  were fixed using
the  transformations inside  and 
denote a basis of generators of the  Cartan
subalgebra. The gravitino mass matrix represents just the upper
off diagonal block of the  Cartan generators
in the .As far as the vectors are concerned we may
build the  generators in the  in
much the same way as we did for the gravitini case, by using the
 generators in the  and in the 
 to form the diagonal  and 
blocks of a  matrix.
 
Here 
, 
 while 
 and 
.

The vector mass matrix is:
 
 By acting by means of  on the rectangular matrix  it is possible to reduce it to the upper off-diagonal part of a generic element of the
 Cartan subalgebra:
 
Using equation () we may read the mass eigenvalues for
the vectors which are just .The above argument may
be extended also to the gaugini and the scalars as discussed in
the next Section.
Duality with a truncation of the spontaneously broken  theory from Scherk-Schwarz reduction
 As discussed in the previous sections the microscopic
interpretation of the fields in our  model is achieved by
its identification, at the ungauged level, with a truncation of
the  theory describing the field theory limit of IIB string
theory on . To this end the symmetry group of the 
action is interpreted as the 
 inside the 
 maximal subgroup of , which
is the natural group to consider when interpreting the four
dimensional theory from the type IIB point of view, since the
 factor represents an enhancement of the
type IIB symmetry group 
, where  is associated to the 
volume, while  is the group acting on
the moduli of the  metric. A different microscopic
interpretation of the ungauged  theory would follow from the
identification of its symmetry group with the group 
 contained in
both  and 
 subgroups of , where, although
the  factor is still 
, the fields are naturally interpreted in
terms of dimensionally reduced M-theory since 
 this time is the group acting on the moduli
of the  torus from  to . At the level of the
 theory the  and the 
 are equivalent, while their embedding in
 is different and so is the microscopic
interpretation of the fields in the corresponding theories. Our
gauged model is obtained by introducing in the model with 
 manifest
symmetry  a gauge group characterized by a flux tensor
transforming in the . It is interesting to
notice that if the symmetry of the ungauged action were
identified with 
 formally we would have the same  gauged
model, but, as we are going to show, this time we could interpret
it as a truncation to  of the spontaneously broken 
theory deriving from a Scherk-Schwarz reduction from . The
latter, as mentioned in the introduction, is a gauged 
theory which is completely defined once we specify the gauge
generator  to be gauged by the
graviphoton arising from the five dimensional metric. The gauging
(couplings, masses etc...) is therefore characterized by the
 representation of , namely by the flux matrix
 (), element of 
.
Decomposing this representation with respect to 
 we have:
 
The representation  defines the gaugings in which
we choose:
 
 These generators can be either compact or non-compact. However, it is known that only for compact  the gauged  theory is a "no-scale" model with  a Minkowski vacuum at the origin of the moduli space (flat gaugings). Let us consider the relevant branchings of 
  representations with respect to :
* 
where the  in the
first branching denote the vectors deriving from five dimensional
vectors while  is the graviphoton. The
truncation to  is achieved at the bosonic level by
projecting the  into 
 and the  into the adjoint of 
, namely 

.If we chose  within   as a
 generator it has only non vanishing entries
 in the blocks 
 and 
 and inspection into the
couplings of these theories shows that the truncation to  is
indeed consistent and that we formally get the  gauged
theory  considered in this paper with six matter multiplets.
Moreover the extremality condition 
 discussed in the previous section coincides with
the condition on  to be compact:
 
After restricting the  generators  to
 they will transform in the 
 with respect to 
,  being the same representation as the
gravitino mass matrix.  In the previous section the itinerary
just described from the  to the  theory was followed
backwards: we have reconstructed the 
 matrix  starting from the symmetry
 of the ungauged  action and the fluxes
 defining the
gauging.



As far as the fermions are concerned, we note that in the 
theory, the gravitini in the  of  decompose
under  as
8 4 ^+1 2  +4 ^-1 2  so that a vector in the  can be
written as
  From
equation usp8  we see that the off diagonal generators in the
coset  belong to the 
 representation 
among which we find the symplectic invariant
 







The basic quantities which define the fermionic masses and the
gradient flows equations of the  model (in absence of
-brane couplings) are the symmetric matrices
S_AB &=&-i 48  (F ^IJK- +C ^IJK- )(_IJK )_AB 

N_AB &=&-1 48 (F^IJK- +C^IJK- )(_IJK )_AB that
belong to the representations   of
 respectively. Note that they have opposite 
 weight w[S_AB ]=-w[N_AB ]=1If we indicate with
,  the 
,  irreducible
representations of the   bulk gaugini, the
weights of the left handed gravitini, dilatini and gaugini as
given in equation pesos  give in this case
 
From equations lagmass , lagpot ,
shgrav -massgaux  it follows that, by suitable
projection on the irreducible representations 
, , the following mass matrices associated
to the various bilinears either depend on the  or
 matrices, according to the following scheme:
 
All these assignments come from the fact that , 
are in the   representations of
 and the mass matrices must have grading opposite to
the bilinear fermions, since the Lagrangian has zero grading.
Indeed, from the group theoretical decomposition we find, for
each of the listed bilinear fermions 4 ^3 2  4 ^3 2  &
&10 ^1 

4 ^3 2  20 ^ -1 2  & &10 ^+1 

4 ^3 2  4 ^ -1 2  & &10 ^ +1 

20 ^ -1 2  20 ^ -1 2  & &10 ^-1 +10 ^ -1 

4 ^ -1 2  4 ^ -1 2  & &10 ^ -1 

4 ^ -1 2  20 ^ -1 2  & &10 ^-1 

4 ^1 2  4 ^-3 2  & &10 ^-1 

4 ^1 2  4 ^1 2  & &10 ^+1 

4 ^1 2  20 ^1 2  & &10 ^ +1 

4 ^1 2  4 ^1 2  &
&10 ^ +1  The decomposition of the

 implies that in principle we have both 
and  appearing in the
 mass term.
However an explicit calculation shows that the
representation , corresponding to  is missing.

The above assignments are consistent with the Scherk-Schwarz
truncation of  supergravity, where the two
matrices ,  contain the 
 of  of the  theory. More
explicitly: Q_5ab && (S_AB , S^AB )

P_5abcd && (N_AB , N^AB )which is
consistent with the fact that, on the vacuum,  in
the Scherk-Schwarz  model and  in our 
orientifold model.

Let us consider now the decomposition of the dilatino in the
 of  under . We get: _abc _ABC ^AB _AB C +h.c.corresponding to
48 4 +20 +4 +20  We may then identify the chiral dilatino and
gaugino as
follows:^A=^ABCD _BCD ;^I(20 ) _C=(^I)_AB ^AB _AB C Moreover the decomposition 
 identifies
 with  and 
 with  as they come
from the -trace part or the threefold antisymmetric
product .

These results are consistent with the explicit reduction
appearing in reference. Indeed the mass term of
reference are of the following form (
Note that the terms 2 , 2x  do not appear explicitly in
the Lagrangian of reference but they would appear
after diagonalization of the fermionic kinetic terms.)  &&Q_5ab ^'a _ ^ ^'b _ 

&&Q_5ab  ^'a ^'b 

&&Q_5ab ^'a _ ^ ^'b 

&&Q_5a ^b  e ^'abc ' _ebc 

&&P_5 ^abcd ^' _a ^  ^5 ^' _bcd 

&&P_5 ^abcd  ^' _a^5^' _bcd The term 1  gives rise to the mass term of the gravitino
; the term
 and the term
 are obtained by
reduction of the structures 2x , 4  via the decompositions
d7 , d8 . The mass term of the bulk gaugini
 is reconstructed from the terms
2 , 3 , 5  through the decompositions d5 ,
d4 , d6 . Finally, the mass term
 is obtained by reducing equation
3 , 5  via the decomposition 2 , 3 .

In
conclusion we see that our theory can be thought as a truncation
of the Scherk-Schwarz  supergravity. Once the Goldstino
 is absorbed to give mass to the gravitino
 the spin  mass matrix is given by the
entries
.
Therefore the full spin  mass spectrum is the
truncation of the Scherk-Schwarz  spin  to
this sectors.

This justifies the results for the mass spectrum given in Section
7. Analogous considerations can be done for the scalar sector.




We conclude by arguing that there is a duality between two
microscopically different theories:
 
since they are described by the same  four dimensional effective field theory.

Finally we consider the fermionic bilinear involving -brane
gaugini . From the structure of the matrices
, , ,
equations shgaui , masschilambda , massgaux , we
notice that they vanish when the -brane coordinates commute
(i.e. the scalars  are in the Cartan subalgebra of ).

The diagonal mass  massii  has a gravitational
part  which vanishes on the vacuum while the
second term is non vanishing for those gaugini which are not in
the Cartan subalgebra of . Indeed, for , there
are exactly  ( BPS) vector multiplets which
become massive when  is spontaneously broken to
.

Appendix A: The solution of the Bianchi Identities and the supersymmetry transformation laws.   
In this Appendix we describe the geometric approach for the
derivation of the  supersymmetry transformation laws of the
physical fields.

The first step to perform is to extend the physical fields to
superfields in  superspace: that means that the space-time
1-forms , ,, , ,
 and the space-time zero-forms , ,
, , ,
, , , ,  are
promoted to one-superforms and zero-superforms in 
superspace, respectively.

As a consequence  the superforms  must depend on the superspace
coordinates  (where , 
are the ordinary space-time coordinates and ,
,  are anticommuting fermionic coordinates
) in such a way that projected on the space-time submanifold
 (i.e. setting ) they correspond to the ordinary physical fields.

 A basis of one-forms on the superspace is  given by , ; here  are the vierbein, and  are the fermionic vielbein identified with the
gravitini
 fields.

 The appropriate definition for the
super-curvatures (or super-field strengths)of the superfield
p-forms in the  superspace is(Here and in the
following by "curvatures" we mean not only two-forms, but also
the one-forms defined as covariant differentials of the
zero-form superfields)  as follows (we omit for simplicity the
sign of wedge product):

 

 is the covariant derivative with respect to all the
connections that act on the field, including the gauge
contribution, while  is the Lorentz covariant
derivative acting on a generic vector  and a generic spinor
 respectively as follows
 
The coefficients appearing in front of the 
connection 
correspond to the different  weights of the fields as shown in equation pesos .

 is the R-symmetry  connection, that
in terms of the gauged  connection 
reads as

(see Appendix D for details).

Equation torsion  is a superspace constraint imposing the absence of supertorsion, on the  superspace.

Note that the definition of the "curvatures" has been chosen in
such a way that in absence of vector multiplets the equations by
setting  give the
Maurer-Cartan equations of the  Poincare superalgebra
dual to the  superalgebra of (anti)-commutators, (the
1-forms  are dual to the
corresponding generators of the supergroup).

By -differentiating the supercurvatures definition
Lorentz -delam , one obtains the Bianchi identities that
are their integrability conditions:
 

Here
 is
the gauged  curvature with R_1^IJ =d_1^IJ +^IK _K^K J -1 2 E^I_Lf^ F_ E^J_The solution can be obtained as
follows: first of all one requires that the expansion of the
curvatures along the intrinsic -forms basis in superspace
namely: 
, is given in terms only of the physical fields (rheonomy).
This insures that no new degree of freedom is introduced in the
theory.


Secondly one writes down such expansion in a form which is
compatible with all the symmetries of the theory, that is:
covariance under  and 
, Lorentz transformations and reparametrization of the
scalar manifold. Besides it is very useful to take into account
the invariance under the following rigid rescalings of the fields
(and their corresponding curvatures):
 
  
  
  
 Indeed these rescalings and the corresponding ones for the
 curvatures leave invariant the definitions of the curvatures and the
 Bianchi identities.

Performing all the steps one finds the final parametrizations of
the superspace curvatures, namely:

 
The previous parametrizations are given up to three fermions
terms, except equation roferm  where the term with two
gravitini has been computed; in fact this term is in principle
involved in the computation of the gravitino shift but by
explicit computation its
contribution vanishes.

As promised the solution for the curvatures is given as an
expansion along the 2-form basis 
 or the 1-form basis
 with coefficients given in terms of the
physical fields.
It is important to stress that the components of the field
strengths along the bosonic vielbeins are not the space-time
field strengths since  
 where  is a
submatrix of the super-vielbein matrix 
. The physical field strengths are given by
the expansion of the forms along the -differentials
and by restricting the superfields to space-time (
component). For example, from the parametrization effe ,
expanding along the -basis one finds:
 
where  is defined by the expansion of eq.
feffe  along the -differentials.
 When all
the superfields are restricted to space-time we may treat the
 vielbein as the usual 4-dimensional invertible matrix
converting intrinsic indices in coordinate indices and we see
that the physical field-strength 
differs from 
 by a set of spinor currents
( is referred to as the
supercovariant field-strength).

Analougous considerations hold for the other field-strengths
components along the bosonic vielbeins.

Note that the solution of the Bianchi identities also imply the a
set of differential constraints on the components along the
bosonic vielbeins which are to be identified, when the fields are
restricted to space-time only, with the equations of motion of
the theory. Indeed the analysis of the Bianchi identities for the
fermion fields give such equations (in the sector containing the
2-form basis ). Further the superspace
derivative along the  directions,
which amounts to a supersymmetry transformation, yields the
equations of motion of the bosonic fields. Indeed the closure of
the Bianchi identities is  equivalent to the closure of the 
supersymmetry algebra on the physical fields and we know that in
general such closure implies the equations of motion .

The determination of the superspace curvatures enables us to
write down the  SUSY transformation laws. Indeed we recall
that from the superspace point of view a supersymmetry
transformation is a Lie derivative along the tangent vector:
 
where the basis tangent vectors  are dual
to the gravitino 1-forms:
 
and  is the unit in spinor space.
Denoting by  and  the set of one-forms 
 and of
two-forms 
 respectively, one has:
 
where  is the derivative covariant with respect to the 
Poincare superalgebra and  is the contraction
operator along the tangent vector .
In our case:
 
(here  is a spinor index)

For the 0-forms which we denote shortly as  we have the
simpler result:
 
Using the parametrizations given for  and  and
identifying  with the restriction of
 to space-time it is immediate to find the 
susy laws for all the fields. The explicit formulae are given by
the equations susytra .




Appendix B: Derivation of the space time Lagrangian from
the geometric approach    In Appendix A
we have seen how to reconstruct the  susy transformation
laws of the physical fields from the solution of the
Bianchi identities in superspace.

In principle, since the Bianchi identities imply the equations of
motion, the Lagrangian could also be completely determined.
However this would be a cumbersome procedure.
In this Appendix we give a short account of the construction of
the Lagrangian on space-time from a geometrical Lagrangian in
superspace. Note that while the solution of the Bianchi
identities is completely equivalent to the ordinary "Superspace
approach" (apart from notations and a different emphasis on the
group-theoretical structure),the geometric approach for the
construction of the Lagrangian is completely
different from the usual superspace approach via integration in superspace

In the geometric (rheonomic) approach the superspace action is a
4-form in superspace integrated on a 4-dimensional (bosonic)
hypersurface  locally embedded in superspace
 
where  is the superspace manifold. Provided we do not
introduce the Hodge duality operator in the construction of 
 the equations of motions derived from the generalized
variational principle  are 3-form or
4-form equations independent from the particular hypersurface
 on which we integrate and they are therefore
valid in all superspace. (-Indeed in the variational principle we
have also to vary the hypersurface which can always compensated
by a diffeomorphism of the fields if the Lagrangian
is written olnly in terms of differential forms).

These superspace equations of motion can be analyzed along the
-form basis. The components of the equations obtained along
bosonic vielbeins give the differential equations for the fields
which, identifying  with space-time, are the
ordinary equations of motion of the theory. The components of the
same equations along -forms containing at least one gravitino
("outer components") give instead algebraic relations which
identify the components of the various "supercurvatures" in the
outer directions in terms of the physical fields along the
bosonic vierbeins (rhenomy principle).
 Actually if we have already solved
the Bianchi identities this requirement is equivalent to identify
the outer components of the curvatures obtained from the
variational principle with those obtained from the Bianchi
identities.
There are simple rules which can be used in order to write down
the most general Lagrangian compatible with this requirement.

The implementation of these rules is described in detail in the
literature to which we refer the interested reader.
Actually one writes down the most general 4-form as a sum of
terms with indeterminate coefficients in such a way that 
be a scalar with respect to all the symmetry transformations of
the theory (Lorentz invariance,U (1), 
 invariance, invariance under the rescaling resc .
Varying the action and comparing the outer equations of motion
with the actual solution of the Bianchi identities one then fixes
all the undetermined coefficients.
Let us perform the steps previously indicated. The most general
Lagrangian has the following form: (we will determine the complete
 Lagrangian up to four fermion terms):


 

 

 

 

Note that in equation paolino  the statement "+ more terms"
means Pauli terms containing currents made out spin 
bilinears which can not be computed in this geometric approach
without knowledge of the four fermion couplings. However these
terms have been included in the space-time Lagrangian given in
Section 5 by imposing the invariance of the space-time
Lagrangian under supersymmetry transformations.

The introduction of the auxiliary 0-forms 
 is a
trick which avoids the use of the Hodge operator for the
construction of the kinetic terms for the vectors and scalar
fields which otherwise would spoil the validity of the 3-form
equations of motion in all superspace; indeed the equation of of
motion of these auxiliary 0-forms identifies them with the
components of the physical field-strengths 
 along the bosonic vielbeins
 thus reconstructing the usual kinetic terms on
space-time.
 The -term has been
constructed in such a way as to give .

Performing the variation of all the fields one fixes all the
undetermined coefficients, namely:
 
In order to obtain the space-time Lagrangian the last step to
perform is the restriction of the 4-form Lagrangian from
superspace to space-time. Namely we restrict all the terms to the
 hypersurface . In
practice one first goes to the second order formalism by
identifying the auxiliary 0-form fields as explained before.
Then one expands all the forms along the  differentials
and restricts the superfields to their lowest ()
component. Finally the coefficients of:
 
give the Lagrangian density written in Section 5. The overall
normalization of the space-time action has been chosen such as to
be the standard one for the Einstein term. (To conform to the
usual definition of the Riemann tensor 
we have set ).


Appendix C: The moduli of  in real and complex coordinates 
  In this
appendix we give a more detailed discussion of the extrema of the
potential using a complex basis for the 
indices for the moduli of the  torus.

Let us consider the basis vectors ,  of
the fundamental representation of . We
introduce a complex basis  with
 or, to avoid confusion on indices,  in
the following way:
 
The axion fields and the (inverse) metric of  can then be
written using (anti)holomorphic indices
 as follows: &&B^ B^ij ,B^i  ,B^ij ,B^i  

&&g^ g^ij ,g^i  ,g^ij ,g^i  

In particular, the fluxes  are
given by
 
while tuttizero 
f^xx y =f^xx z =f^yy x =f^yy z =f^zz x =f^zz y =0and therefore, the twenty entries of  are reduced to
eight.

In this holomorphic basis the gravitino mass eigenvalues assume
the rather simple form:
 
We note that the three axions

are inert under -gauge transformations, since we have 15
axions but only 12 bulk vectors.

When we consider the truncation to the  theory we expect
that only 9 complex scalar fields become massless moduli
parametrizing 
. Moreover, it is easy to see that if we set e.g.
 ( ) which implies

() in the 
theory, we get that also the 6 fields

are inert under gauge transformations.

In holomorphic coordinates, the translational gauging implies that
the differential of the axionic fields become covariant and they
are obtained by the substitution: &&dB^ij dB^ij +(f^ijk )A_k 1 +(f^ijk  )A_k 1 +(f^ijk )A_k 2 +
(f^ijk  )A_k 2 

&&dB^i  dB^i  +(f^i  k)
1 A_k1 +(f^i k ) A_k 1 + (f^i  k) 1 A_k2 +(f^i k ) A_k 2 Since in the  truncation the only
surviving massless moduli fields are
, then the 3+3
axions  must
become massive, while  must be zero. We
see from equation bij  we see that we must put to zero the
components f^i k =f^i k  =f^ijk  =0while f^ijk f^ijk 0Looking at the
equations () we see that these relations are
exactly the same which set
 and
, confirming that the chosen complex
structure corresponds to the  theory. Note that the
corresponding  fields partners of
 in the chosen complex structure
parametrize the coset 
. Actually the freezing of the
holomorphic  gives the following relations among the
components in the real basis of
: && g^14 =g^25 =g^36 =0

&&g^11 -g^44 =0,  g^22 -g^55 =0,  g^33 -g^66 =0

&&g^12 -g^45 =0,  g^13 -g^46 =0,  g^23 -g^56 =0

&&g^15 +g^24 =0,  g^16 +g^34 =0,  g^26 +g^35 =0The
 freezing of the axions   in the holomorphic basis give the analogous equations:
 
The massless  and 
are instead given by the following combinations:
ziagina  g^xx  =1 2 (g^11 +g^44 ),
 g^yy  =1 2 (g^22 +g^55 ), 
g^zz  =1 2 (g^33 +g^66 )B^xx  =i 2 B^14 , 
B^yy  =i 2 B^25 , 
B^zz  =i 2 B^36 ziopino 
&&g^xy  =1 2 (g^12 +ig^15 ), 
g^xz  =1 2 (g^13 +ig^16 ), 
g^yz  =1 2 (g^23 +ig^26 )

&&B^xy  =1 2 (B^12 +iB^15 ), 
B^xz  =1 2 (B^13 +iB^16 ), 
B^yz  =1 2 (B^23 +iB^26 )

&&B^xx =B^yy =B^zz =0 
Let us now
consider the reduction  for which the
relevant moduli space is 

 . Setting  we find: f^xy z =f^xyz  =0which , in real
components implies:f^123 +f^156 =0;f^246 +f^345 =0 and analogous equations for their Hodge
dual. This implies that in the  phase two more axions are
gauge inert namely  and
 or, in holomorphic components,
. The five fields 

parametrize the coset . 

If we now consider the truncation  the
relevant coset manifold is  which
contains 3 complex moduli. To obtain the corresponding complex
structure, it is sufficient to freeze
 with .
In particular the   can be decomposed into 
 where  the three  and the
three translations  are parametrized by ,
,  and
, ,  respectively.

These axions are massless because of equation tuttizero  (Note
that the further truncation  does not
alter the coset manifold  since we have no loss
of massless fields in this process). In this case we may easily
compute the moduli dependence of the gravitino masses. Indeed,
, using equations ziapina , ziagina ,
will have as coset representative the matrix

 

where we have set
,
the exponentials representing the radii of the manifold
.
 We see that in
the gravitino mass formula the  vielbein  reduces to
the diagonal components of the matrix cosettone  A
straightforward computation then gives: S_AB S ^AB =1 (48)^2 e^(2_1+2_2+2_3) 
 We note that in the present formulation where we have used a
contravariant  as basic charged fields, the gravitino
mass depends on the  volume. However if we made use of the
dual 4-form , as it comes from Type  string
theory, then the charge coupling would be given in terms of
 and the gravitino mass matrix would be
trilinear in  instead of . Therefore all our
results can be translated in the new one by replacing
.


Appendix D: Conventions 
 
We realize the isomorphism between the two fold antisymmetric
representation of  and the fundamental of 

using the  -matrix .

We have used the following representation  
Note that their anticommutator is
, where the complex conjugation
acts as
(^I )^AB =( ^I)_AB =1 2 ^ABCD (^I)_CD We define
&&(^IJ )_A^B B =1 2 [(^[I )_AC (^J] )^CB ]

&&(^IJK )_AB =1 3! [(^I)_AC (^J)^CD (^K)_DB +perm.]Here the matrices  are symmetric and satisfy
the relation
 
In this representation, the following matrices are diagonal:
 as well as the matrices , , 
 and  related with them through the relation
().

We define for a generic tensor
  so that
  In
particular we need to convert the  indices of
 into  -symmetry indices as they
appear in the covariant derivative on spinors. For this purpose
we apply the previous definition conversion  to the connection
 defining ^AB _CD 1 4 (_I)^AB (_J)_CD _1^IJ then we introduce the connection  defined as ^AB _CD ^[A _[C Q^B] _D]  and thus
Q^A_D =-1 2 ^AB _BD =1 8 (_IJ )^A_D _1^IJ  One
can easily realize that given the definition of the 
 curvature as R_1^IJ d^IJ _1+^I_1
K ^KJ _1  one finds for consistence that
R^A_B dQ^A_B -2 Q^A_C Q^C_B =1 8 (_IJ )^A_B R_1^IJ As a consequence, the covariant derivative acting on spinors
turns out to be D_A=d_A-2Q^A_B _B=d_A-1 4 (_IJ )^A_B _1^IJ _B
