Starting with a Lie algebroid  over a space  we  lift
its action to the canonical transformations on the affine bundle
 over the cotangent bundle . Such lifts are classified
by the first cohomology . The resulting object is a
Hamiltonian algebroid  over  with the anchor map from
 to Hamiltonians of canonical transformations.
Hamiltonian algebroids generalize Lie algebras of
canonical transformations. We prove that the BRST operator for 
is cubic in the ghost fields as in the Lie algebra case.
The Poisson sigma model is a natural example of this construction.
Canonical transformations of its phase space define a Hamiltonian algebroid
with the Lie brackets related to the Poisson structure on the target space.
We apply this scheme to analyze the symmetries of generalized deformations
of complex structures on Riemann curves  of genus 
with  marked points.
We endow the space of local -opers with the Adler-Gelfand-Dikii (AGD)
Poisson brackets. Its allows us to define a Hamiltonian algebroid over
the phase space of -gravity on . The sections of the
algebroid are Volterra operators on    with the Lie brackets
coming from the AGD bivector. The symplectic reduction
defines the finite-dimensional moduli space of -gravity and in particular
the moduli space of the complex structures  on  deformed
by the Volterra operators.



 Introduction 
 Lie groups by no means exhaust symmetries in gauge theories.
Their importance is related to the natural geometric structures
defined by a group action in accordance with the Erlanger
program of F.Klein. The first class constraints in Hamiltonian systems
generate the canonical transformations of the phase space which generalize the
Lie group actions.
There exists a powerful approach to treat such
types of structures. It is the BRST method that is applicable in
Hamiltonian and Lagrangian forms. The BRST operator
corresponding to arbitrary first class constraints acquires the most general
form. An intermediate step in this direction is the canonical transformations
generated by the quasigroups.
The BRST operator for the quasigroup action has the same form as for
the Lie group case.

Here we consider the quasigroup symmetries
constructed by means of special transformations of the "coordinate
space" . These transformations along with the coordinate space  define
the Lie groupoids, or their infinitesimal version - the Lie algebroids
.
We lift the algebroid action from  to the cotangent bundle ,
or, more generally, to the
 principle homogeneous space  over
the cotangent bundle . We call this bundle
the Hamiltonian algebroid  related to the Lie algebroid .
The Hamiltonian algebroid is an analog of the Lie algebra of symplectic
vector fields with respect to the canonical symplectic structure on
 or .
The lifts  from  to 's are classified by the first cohomology group .
We prove that the BRST operator of  has the same structure as
for the Lie algebras transformations.

The general example of this construction is the Poisson sigma-model.
The Lie brackets of the Hamiltonian algebroid over the
phase space of the Poisson sigma-model are defined by the Poisson bivector on the target space .

Our main interest lies in topological field
theories,
where the factorization with respect to the canonical gauge transformations
may lead to generalized  deformations of corresponding moduli spaces.
We apply
this scheme to analyze the moduli space of deformations of the
complex structures on Riemann curves
of genus  with   marked points 
by differential operators of finite order, or equivalently by the
Volterra operators.

To define the deformations
we start with the space  of -opers over ,
 and define a Lie algebroid  over . The Lie brackets on the space of sections
 are derived from the Adler-Gelfand-Dikii brackets for the
local opers over a punctured disk . In this way the set of
the local opers serves as the target space of the Poisson sigma-model.
The space  of -opers is the space of the projective structures on
 and the Lie algebroid  leads to the Lie algebra of vector
fields on . The case  is more subtle and we deal with a genuine
Lie algebroids since differential operators of order greater than one do
not form a Lie algebra with respect to the standard commutator.
The AGD brackets define a new commutator on  that depends on
the projective structure and higher spin fields. In other words, for 
we deal with the structure functions rather than with the structure constants.

The space  of -opers can be considered as a configuration space
of -gravity. The whole phase space 
of -gravity is the
affinization of the cotangent bundle . Its sections define the
deformations of the operator  by the Volterra
operators.  The canonical transformations of  are
sections of the Hamiltonian algebroid  over .
The symplectic quotient of the phase space
is the so-called -geometry of . Roughly speaking, this space is
a combination of the moduli of generalized complex structures
 and the spin ,spin  fields as the dual variables.
To define the -geometry
we construct the BRST operator for the Hamiltonian algebroid. As it follows from
the general construction, it has the same structure as in the Lie algebra case.
We consider in detail the simplest nontrivial case . It is possible
in this case to describe
explicitly the sections of the algebroid as the second order differential operators,
instead of Volterra operators. This algebroid is
generalization
of the Lie algebra vector fields on .
It should be noted that the BRST operator for the -algebras was constructed
in. But here we construct the BRST operator for the different object
- the algebroid symmetries of -gravity.  Recently, another BRST description
of -symmetries  was proposed in Ref..
We explain our formulae and the origin of the algebroid
by the special gauge procedure of the  Chern-Simons theory using an
approach developed in Ref..

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we define the general
Hamiltonian algebroids, their cohomolgies and the BRST construction.
We also introduce a special class of Hamiltonian algebroids  related to
Lie algebroids and prove that the BRST has the Lie algebraic form.
In Section 3 we treat the Poisson sigma model and its symmetries as a
Hamiltonian algebroid  related to a Lie algebroid. In Section 4 we consider
two examples of our construction when the algebroids coincide with Lie algebras.
Namely, we analyze the moduli space of flat -bundles
and the moduli of projective structures on .
A nontrivial example of this construction is -gravity.
It is considered in detail in Section 5.
The general case  is analyzed in Section 6.


Hamiltonian  algebroids and  groupoids 

Lie algebroids and groupoids 

We start with a brief description of Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids.
Details of this theory can be found in.
 
A Lie algebroid  over a differential manifold  is a vector bundle
 with
a Lie algebra structure on the space of its sections 
 defined by the Lie brackets 
 and
a bundle map (the anchor ) , satisfying the following
conditions:

(i) For any 
5.1 
[__1 ,__2 ]=__1_2 ,
(ii) For any  and 
5.2 
_1,f_2+ (__1  f)_2.
In other words, the anchor  defines a representation of 
in the Lie algebra of vector fields
on . The second condition is the Leibnitz rule with respect to the multiplication of
the sections by smooth functions.

Let  be a basis of local sections . Then  the brackets
are defined by the structure functions  of the algebroid
5.1b 
e^j,e^kjk _i(x)e^i,  xM.
Using the Jacobi identity for the anchor action, we find
5.3 
C^n_j,k,m _e_n =0,
where
5.4 
C^n_jkm =f^jk _i(x)f_n^im (x)+_e^m f^jk _n(x)+c.p. (j,k,m).
(The sums over repeated indices are understood throughout the paper.) 
Thus, () implies the anomalous Jacobi identity  (AJI)
5.5 
f^jk _i(x)f_n^im (x)+_e^m f^jk _n(x)+c.p. (j,k,m)=0.
Here are some examples of Lie algebroids.

1)If the anchor is trivial, then  is just a bundle of Lie algebras.

2)Consider an integrable system that has the Lax representation



The Lax operator  belongs to some subvariety  of an ambient
space . In many cases it is
a Lie coalgebra. The second operator  defines the tangent vector field
to .
The operators  are sections of the Lie algebroid  over
 with the anchor determining by the Lax equation.
In the similar way the dressing transformations
are sections of the algebroid over .

3) Lie algebroids can be constructed from Lie algebras.
Let  be a Lie group that act on a space  and  is subgroup of . Consider the set
of orbits . For  we have the decomposition the tangent space
a1 
T_xS=T_xMT_xO _P,
where   is the orbit of  containing .
Let  be an element of the Lie algebra 
and Pr be the projection on the second term in ().
 Impose the following condition on the vector field 
a2 
Pr _P_(x)=0
The subspace of the Lie algebra  that satisfy this condition
is the set of the sections of the Lie algebroid .
The anchor is defined by the first term in ().
The commutators on the sections is the commutators of .

In a generic case a Lie algebroid can be integrated to a global object
 - the Lie groupoid .
 
A Lie groupoid  over a manifold 
is a pair of differential manifolds ,  two
differential mappings  and a partially defined binary operation
(a product)
 satisfying the following conditions:

(i) It is defined only when . 

(ii) It is associative: 
whenever the products are defined.

(iii) For any  there exist the left and right identity elements  and
 such that .

(iv) Each  has an inverse  such that  and
.

We denote an element of  by the triple , where .
Then  the product  is



An orbit of the groupoid in the base  is defined as an equivalence
 if . The isotropy subgroup  for  is
defined as




The Lie algebroid is a local version of the Lie groupoid. The anchor is determined in
terms of the multiplication law.
Details can be found in.


Lie algebroid representations and Lie algebroid cohomology 

The definition of algebroids representations is rather evident:
 
A vector bundle representation (VBR)  of the Lie algebroid
 over 
is a vector bundle  over  and a map
  from  to the bundle of differential operators on  of the order
 less or equal to  ,
 such that:

(i) the symbol of  is a scalar equal to the anchor of :



(ii) for any 
rep 
[(_1 ),(_2 )]=(_1_2 ),
 where  the l.h.s. denotes
the commutator of differential operators.

For example, the trivial bundle is a VBR representation (the map 
is the anchor map ),

Consider a small disk  with local coordinates
. Then the anchor can be written as
5.15i 
_e^j =b^j_a(x) x_a =b^j x .
(The brackets  mean summations over all indices,
 taking a traces,
integrations, etc.) 
Let  be a section of the tangent bundle . Then the VBR on
  takes
the form
5.15j 
 _e^j w=b^j x w- x b^jw.
Similarly, the VBR the action of  on a section  of  is
5.16i 
_e^j p= x pb^j(x)  .
We drop a more general definition of the sheaf representation.

Now we define  cohomology groups of  algebroids.
First, we consider the case of contractible base .
Let  be a bundle over  dual to .
 Consider the bundle of graded commutative algebras
.
The space 
is generated by the sections :
. It is a graded algebra






 Define the Cartan-Eilenberg operator "dual" to the  brackets
 




5.6 
-_j<i 
(-1)^i+j c_n(x;e^i ,e^j,,e ^j ,,e ^i ,,e^n ).
It follows from () and AJI () that .
Thus,
 determines a complex of bundles .

The cohomology groups of this complex are called the cohomology groups of
algebroid with trivial coefficients .
This complex is  a part of the BRST complex
derived below.

 The action of the coboundary operator  takes the following form
 on the lower cochains:
5.7 
sc(x;)=_c(x),
5.8 
sc(x;_1,_2)=__1 c(x;_2)-__2 c(x;_1)-
c(x;_1,_2),
5.9 
sc(x;_1,_2,_3)=__1 c(x;_2,_3)-
__2 c(x;_1,_3)








It follows from () that   is isomorphic to the
invariants in the space . The next cohomology group
 is responsible for the shift of the anchor action:
5.11 
 _f(x)= _f(x)+c(x;),   sc(x;)=0.
If  is a cocycle (see ()), then this action is
 consistent with the defining anchor property ().
 The action () on 
takes the form
5.11a 
 _ This formula defines a "new" structure of VBR on the trivial   line
bundle.
Let  be the
set of orbits of the groupoid  on its base .
The condition
5.11b 
 _ defines a linear bundle  over .

Two-cocycles  allow to construct
the central extensions of brackets on 
5.9a 
(_1,k_1 ),(_2,k_2 )_c.e. =
(_1,_2,c (x;_1,_2)).
The cocycle condition () means that the new brackets
 satisfies AJI ().
The exact cocycles leads to the splitted extensions.

If  is not contractible the definition of cohomology group is more
complicated. We sketch the C ech version of it.
Choose an acyclic covering . Consider the C ech
complex with coefficients in 
corresponding to this covering:






The C ech differential  commutes with  the Cartan-Eilenberg operator
, and cohomology of algebroid are cohomology of normalization of this
bicomplex :
























The cochains
 

 are bigraded. The differential maps  to ,
 has type  for  and  for .


Again, the group   is isomorphic to the
invariants in the whole space .

Consider the next group .
It has  two components
 .
They are characterized by the following conditions (see ())
 



ch1 
  _ c_ (x)=-c_(x;)+c_(x;),
ch2 
 c_ (x)=c_ (x)+c_ (x).
While the first component   comes from the algebroid action
on  and define the action of the algebroid on the trivial bundle
(), the second
component  determines a line bundle  on  by the transition functions
. The condition () shows that the actions on
the restriction to  are compatible.


The continuation of the central extension () from  on  is defined now
by .
There is an obstacle to this continuations in .
We do not dwell on this point.


Hamiltonian algebroids 

We modify the notion of the Lie algebroids in the following way.
Let  be a Poisson manifold.
 Any smooth function 
 gives rise to a vector field



The space  has
the structure of a Lie algebra with respect to the Poisson brackets.
In what follows we assume that  is a symplectic manifold with
the symplectic form . In this case the Poisson brackets



are defined by the internal derivation  of
the symplectic form .

Let  be a vector bundle over  and
assume that the space of sections  is equipped by
 the Lie brackets .
 
 is a Hamiltonian  algebroid  over a Poisson
manifold  if there exists
a bundle map from  to the Lie algebra
on : , (i.e.  for
)
satisfying the following conditions:

(i) For any 
5.12 
 h__1 ,h__2 =h__1,_2  .


(ii) For any  and 



The both conditions are similar to the defining properties of the
Lie algebroids (),().
 
In contrast with the Lie algebroids with the anchor , that is a
bundle map:
,
 for the Hamiltonian algebroids
one has the map to the first order differential operators with respect to 




Let  be structure functions of a Hamiltonian algebroid  and



Then the Jacobi identity for the Poisson brackets implies
5.13a 
C_n^j,k,m h_^n =0.
This identity is similar to () for Lie algebroids.
But now one can add to   the term proportional to
 without the breaking ()
(here  means the antisymmetrization).
Thus, the Jacobi identity for the Poisson algebra of Hamiltonians leads
to following identity for the structure functions
5.14 
f^jk _i(x)f_n^im (x)+h_e^m ,f^jk _n(x)+
E^j,k,m _[ln] h_^l +c.p.(j,k,m)=0.
This structure arises in the Hamiltonian systems with the first class constraints
 and leads to the so-called open algebra of an arbitrary rank (see).

The important particular case
5.15 
f^jk _i(x)f_n^im (x)+H_^m f^jk _n(x)+c.p.(j,k,m)=0
corresponds to the open algebra of rank one similar to the
Lie algebroid (). We will call () a simple anomalous
Jacobi identity (SAJI) preserving the notion AJI for the general form ().
In this case the Hamiltonian algebroid can be integrated to the Hamiltonian groupoid.
The later is the Lie groupoid with the canonical action
with respect to the symplectic form on the base .


Symplectic affine bundles over cotangent bundles 

We shall define Hamiltonian algebroids over cotangent bundles which
are a special class of symplectic manifold. There exist a slightly more general
symplectic manifolds than cotangent bundles, that we include in our
scheme. It is  an affinization over a cotangent bundle we are going to
define. Let  be a vector space and  is a set with an action of
 on 



 
The set  is an affinization  over  (a principle homogeneous
space  over )  if the action of  on   is transitive
and exact.
In other words, for any pair  there exists  such that
, and  if .

This construction is generalized on bundles. Let  be a bundle over  and
 be the linear space of sections in a trivialization of  over some
 disk .
 
An affinization   of  
 is a bundle over  with the space of
local sections  defined as the affinization over .
Two affinizations  and  are equivalent if there
exists a bundle map compatible with the action of the corresponding vector bundles.
It can be proved that non-equivalent affinizations are classified by .

Let .
Consider a linear bundle  over . The space of connections
Conn can be identified with the space of sections
. In fact, for any
connection  one can define another connection
. The affinization  can be classified by
the first Chern class . The trivial bundles correspond to
.

The affinization  is
the symplectic space with the canonical form . In contrast with 
this form is not exact, since  is defined only locally.
In the similar way as for ,
the space of square integrable sections  plays the role of
the Hilbert space in the prequantization of the affinization .
For  define the Hamiltonian vector field  and the
covariant derivative    along .
Then the prequantization of  is determined by the operators



acting on the space . In particular,
,
.

The basic example, though for infinite-dimensional spaces, is the affinizations over
the antiHiggs bundles.
(We use the antiHiggs bundles instead of the standard Higgs bundles for
reasons, that will become clear in Sect. 4.) 
The antiHiggs bundle  is a cotangent bundle to the space
of connections  in a vector bundle of rank 
over a Riemann curve
. The cotangent vector (the antiHiggs field) is  valued -form
. The symplectic form on  is

.
The affinizations 
are the space of connections 
 with the
symplectic form , where  parameterizes the
affinizations. The elements of the space Conn
giving rise to    are
na 
 A +.
Hamiltonian algebroids related to Lie algebroids 

Now we are ready to introduce an important subclass of Hamiltonian algebroids.
They are extensions of the Lie algebroids and share with them
SAJI ().

 
The anchor action () of the Lie algebroid  over 
can be lifted to the Hamiltonian action on 
 such that it defines the Hamiltonian algebroid  over .
The equivalence classes of these lifts
are isomorphic to .
Proof .
Consider a small disk . The anchor () has the form
5.15a 
 _e^j =b^j x +c(x;e^j).
Next, continue the action on .
We represent the affinization
as the space 

Conn
.
Since  on  is trivialized we can identify the connections
with one-forms .
Let  and




be the covariant derivative along .
 To lift the action we use the
Leibniz
rule for the anchor action on the covariant derivatives:




It follows from () and () that
5.16a 
 _e^j p=- x pb^j(x) x c(x;e^j).
Note that the second term is responsible for the pass from  to
the affinization , otherwise  is transformed as a cotangent vector
(see ()).

The vector fields () are hamiltonian
 with respect
to the canonical symplectic form  on .
The corresponding  Hamiltonians have the linear dependence on "momenta":
5.17 
h^j=pb^j(x)+c^j(x).
Note that  satisfies the Hamiltonian algebroid
property (), since  ().

We have constructed the Hamiltonians locally and want to prove that this definition
is compatible with gluing
 and . Note, that when we glue  
 and 
we shift fibers by  :
. Indeed,
 we glue the bundle 
restricted on  by multiplication on  .
The connections are
transformed
by adding the logarithmic derivative of the transition functions.
On the other hand, 
(see ()). So








and the Hamiltonians become defined globally.

The exact cocycle 
shifts the momenta
.


We rewrite the canonical transformations in the form





Thus, all nonequivalent
lifts of anchors from  to  are in one-to-one correspondence
with .
Thereby, we have constructed the Hamiltonian
algebroid  over the principle homogeneous  space .
It has the same fibers and
the same structure functions  as the underlying Lie algebroid 
over  and the bundle map  ().


Now investigate AJI () in this particular case.
 
The Hamiltonian algebroids   have the SAJI ().
Proof .

First note that the Lie algebroids we started with have the
SAJI (). The Hamiltonian algebroids
 have the same structure functions
 depending on coordinates on  only. Consider
the general AJI (). It follows from ()
that




The sum of the first two terms in () coincides with
the SAJI () in the underlying Lie algebroid , and therefore vanishes.



Reduced phase space and its BRST description 

In what follows we shall consider Hamiltonian algebroids related to
Lie algebroids. Let  be a basis of sections in .
Then the Hamiltonians () can be represented in the form
, where  defines the moment map 



The coadjoint action  in  is defined
in the usual way



One can fix a moment   in .
 The reduced phase space is defined as the quotient



where  is  generated by the  transformations
 such that . In other words, 
is the set of orbits of  on the constraint surface .
The symplectic form  being restricted on  is non-degenerate.

The BRST approach allows us to go around the reduction procedure by introducing
additional fields (the ghosts).
We shall construct the BRST complex for  in a similar way as the
Cartan-Eilenberg complex for the Lie algebroid . The BRST complex
is endowed with a Poisson structure and it
allows us to define the nilpotent BRST operator.

 Consider the dual bundle .
Its  sections  are the anti-commuting (odd) fields called
 the ghosts .
Let , where  is a basis in
 and  are the moment constraints, generating the
canonical algebroid action on .
 Introduce another type of odd variables (the ghost momenta )
 dual to the ghosts 
.
 We attribute the ghost
 number one to the ghost fields gh, minus one to the ghost momenta
gh and gh for .
Introduce
the Poisson brackets in addition to the non-degenerate Poisson structure on 
5.19 
_j,P ^k=_j^k,  ^j,x=P _k,x=0.
Thus, all fields are incorporated in the graded Poisson superalgebra







(the Batalin-Fradkin-Volkovitsky (BFV) algebra ).

There exists a nilpotent operator  on the BFV algebra 
(the BRST operator ) transforming  into the BRST complex.
The cohomology of the BRST complex give rise to the structure of
the classical reduced phase space . In some cases

 and  classical observables.

Represent the action of  as the Poisson brackets:



Due to the Jacobi identity for the Poisson brackets the nilpotency of 
is equivalent to
.
Since  is odd, the brackets are symmetric.
 For generic Hamiltonian algebroid 
 can be represented as the expansion


where the higher order terms in  are omitted.
The highest order of 
in  is called the rank  of the BRST operator .
If  is a Lie algebra defined along with its canonical
action on  then  has the rank one or less. In this case
the BRST operator  is the extension of the Cartan-Eilenberg operator
giving rise to the cohomology of  with coefficients in
. Due to the Jacobi identity
the first two terms in the previous expression provide
the nilpotency of . It turns out that for the Hamiltonian algebroids 
 has the same structure as for  the Lie algebras
 though the Jacobi identity has additional terms.
 
The BRST operator  for the Hamiltonian algebroid 
has the rank one:
5.20 
F+,P .
Proof .

 Straightforward  calculations show that










The sum of the first three terms vanishes due to ().
The sum of the rest terms is the left hand side of the SAJI ().
The additional dangerous term may come from the Poisson brackets of
the structure functions
. In fact, these
brackets vanish because the structure functions
do not depend
on the ghost momenta. Thus, the SAJI leads to the desired identity .


Hamiltonian algebroids and Poisson sigma-model 

Cotangent bundles to Poisson manifolds
as Lie algebroids 

Let  be a Poisson manifold with Poisson bivector ,
where     are section of the bundle .
It is a skewsymmetric tensor, with the vanishing Schouten brackets (the Jacobi identity)
. It means
in local coordinates 
2.1 
_i^jk (x)^im (x)+c.p. (j,k,m)=0.
The Poisson brackets are defined on the space of smooth functions




The Poisson bivector gives rise to  the  map
2.2a 
V^:T^*MTM,  
V^_The corresponding Lie derivative 
acts as
dx 
_x=(x).
In this way we obtain a map from the space of smooth functionals 
 to the space of the Hamiltonian vector fields 
2.2 
fV_f= df.
The Poisson brackets  can be rewritten as
.

One can define the brackets on the one-forms 
2.3 
,d+d 
 is a Lie algebroid  over the Poisson manifold 
with the Lie brackets () and the anchor ().
Proof. 


It follows from the Jacobi identity (), that
the brackets () is the Lie brackets and the
commutator of the vector fields  satisfies ()
2.3a 
[ V_,V_,The property
() follows from the definition of Lie brackets ().


The structure functions  of   is defined by the Poisson bivector



This type of Lie algebroids was introduced in
Ref. ,.

 
A linear space  with the linear Poisson brackets 
can be identified with a Lie coalgebra .
 Then the Hamiltonian vector field coming from the anchor 
is just the coadjoint action
co 
V^_ad ^*_.

Consider a punctured
 disk  and the space of the meromorphic maps

.
Define the Lie algebroid  over the space
 with the brackets () on  the sections of .
For simplicity we do not change the notion of the anchor action
7.4b 
_X=(X).
Poisson sigma-model and Hamiltonian algebroids 

The Poisson sigma-model is a way to construct a Hamiltonian
algebroid related to the Lie algebroid  .
The manifold  serves as the target space for the Poisson sigma model.
The space-time  is the disk .

Consider  the one-form  on  taking values in the pull-back by
 of the cotangent bundle , or the affinization over .
Endow the space of fields  with
the canonical symplectic form

The canonical transformations of   is
represented by () and according with () by
7.5 
 _ X c(X,)
+ X -+ X ,
where   is the anti-holomorphic one-cocycle  from 
7.7 
c(X,)=-12 X.
These transformations are generated by the first class constraints
 7.3 
F:=X+(X)The action () amounts to the lift of the anchor action from 
to
the affinization  over 
 by means of the cocycle () in accordance with Lemma 2.1.
The canonical transformations of a smooth functionals on 
 are the Hamiltonian transformation
anc 
 _  f(X,)=h_ ,f(X,).
Here the Poisson brackets are inverse to the symplectic form 
()
and
7.8 
h_ = F.
(see ()).
Again, due to the cocycle property,
.

Summarizing, we have defined the symplectic manifold
 
and the Hamiltonian algebroid
 over  with the sections
 and the anchor (),().

Following our approach we interpret the constraints  () as the consistency
conditions for a linear system.
Let  be sections of  and 
correspondingly, and  is a family of the linear maps
 to 
7.4c 
B(X)=+(X),  B(X)_1=_2.
Consider the linear system
7.4a 
B(X)_1=0.
The second equation is
7.5a 
A^*_1=0,
where  is the linear map

7.5c 
A=-+ X ,
and 



 
Let the Poisson bivector satisfies the non-degeneracy condition:

 the matrix  is non-degenerate
on  for some .

 Then the constraints  () are the consistency
conditions for () and ().
Proof. 
The consistency condition of these equations is the operator equation



After substitution in it the expressions for  and applying the Jacobi identity
() one comes to the equality



The later is equivalent to the constraint equation () if  is
non-degenerate in the above sense. 

BRST construction 

Consider a smooth functional   on 
annihilating by the anchor action
LB 
 _ (X):=12 
(X)d(X)+
(12 X)(X)=0.
Let  be the Lie groupoid corresponding to the Lie algebroid .
Consider the space of orbits 
and the line bundle  over
 with
 the space of sections  ().
The Hilbert space  arises in the prequantization
of the symplectic quotient

,
where  is the Hamiltonian groupoid.

The quantization of  can be performed by the BRST technique.
The classical BRST complex is the set of fields






where the first component is the space of sections of the anticommuting
variables  dual to the gauge generators , the second component
is the space of their momenta .
Theorem 2.1 states that the BRST operator has the rank one




It means that the nonlinear deformation of the Poisson bivector on 
does not affect the Lie algebraic form of .
This form of  for the Poisson sigma model
was established in.


Two examples of Hamiltonian algebroids with
Lie algebra symmetries 

In this section we consider two examples, where the spaces of sections
of the Hamiltonian
algebroids are just  Lie algebras of hamiltonian
vector fields and therefore the symmetries are the standard Lie
symmetries.
Nevertheless, they are in much the same
as in the  algebroid cases.
In both examples we cast the known constructions in the form suitable
to our approach.

Let  be a Riemann curve of
 genus 
with  marked points. The first examples is the moduli
space of flat bundles over . It will become clear later,
that it is
an universal system containing hidden algebroid symmetries.
 The second example is
the projective structures (-structures) on .
Their generalization is the -structures, where
the symmetries are
defined by a nontrivial Hamiltonian  algebroid, will be considered
in next Sections.

Flat bundles  with the regular singularities 

Consider a  holomorphic bundle   over
 .
Let  be a small punctured disk embedded to 
with a local coordinate .
Locally  the derivatives
 ,
 take the form
8.0 
d'=+A,   d"=.
Let  be the set of
derivatives restricted to .  This set has the structure
of the affine Lie coalgebra
 with the Lie-Poisson brackets on the space of smooth functionals





where  is the variation of .
Thereby  can be considered as
 the base of the Lie algebroid 
 (see Remark 3.1).
The space of sections of the algebroid is the Lie algebra

of  the gauge transformations
8.1 
_A=+[A,].
Though the Poisson structure
is defined only on  the algebroid
can be defined over , since the gauge algebra
and the anchor action () are well defined globally.
We denote by   the algebra
of the smooth global gauge transformations.
To come to the global description
we assume that  has first order holomorphic poles at the marked points
8.0a 
A_zx_a =A_a z-x_a .
In addition, we consider a collection  of   elements from  the
Lie coalgebra



endowed with the Lie-Poisson structure

.
We assume that the gauge transformations at the marked points are nontrivial
8.0b 
_zx_a =r_a+O(z-x_a),   r_a0.
The gauge algebra  acts on  by the evaluation maps
8.1a 
_p_a=[p_a,r_a],  
G _SL_N .
In this way we define a trivial Lie algebroid

over
  with the anchor map (), ().

The cohomology

are the standard cohomology
of the gauge algebra  with the cochains taking values
in functionals on .  There is a nontrivial one-cocycle
8.2 
c(A,;)=__g,n  (
A-2i_a=1 ^n(x_a)p_a
)=
Ai_a=1 ^n(r_ap_a)
representing an element of .
 This cocycle provides a nontrivial
extension of the anchor action (see ())
8.2a 
 _f(A,)
=A-(df(A))+[df(A),A]-2i_a=1 ^n(r_a p_a) .
Next consider  contours 
 generating . The contours determine the 2-cocycles
8.3 
c_(_1,_2)=__ (_1_2).
The cocycles () lead to  central extensions
 of 








To define the corresponding Poisson sigma-model we
consider the cotangent bundle .
The conjugate to
 variables are the one-forms

 - the antiHiggs field.
In fact, we shall consider the affinization
 over
 provided
by the cocycle (). We have already mentioned that
 the role of momenta plays by  the holomorphic connection  ().
 We put . The symplectic form on  is




Consider the contributions of the marked points. We define there the symplectic manifold



The dual variables to  at the marked points are  elements
 
and the symplectic form  is
8.4c 
_a=1 ^n_a=_a=1 ^nD(p_ag_a^-1 Dg_a).
Here

is the canonical symplectic form on .
We pass from  to the coadjoint orbits




The orbits are the symplectic quotient
 with respect to the action

.
The form  coincides on  with the Kirillov-Kostant form
. The orbits  are
affinizations  over
the cotangent bundles  to the flag varieties .

Eventually we come
 to the symplectic manifold



8.4a 
a=1 ^n_a=DAD+_a=1 ^nD(p^0_aDg_a g_a^-1 ).
 According to
() the lift of the anchor () to ,
defined by the cocycle  () leads  to the Hamiltonian





The Hamiltonian generates the canonical vector fields () () and



(see ()).
The global version of this transformations is the gauge group
 acting on .
The flatness condition
8.5a 
m:=F(A,)-2i_a=1 ^n(x_a)p_a=0
is the moment constraint with respect to this action. This equation means
that the residues  of  in the marked points () coincide with
.
The flatness is the compatibility condition for the linear
system
8.5c 

 
.
where . The second equation
describes the deformation of the holomorphic structure of the bundle 
 ().

The moduli space  of flat -bundles
is the symplectic quotient
. It has  dimension
8.5b 
M ^flat _N=2(N^2-1)(g-1)+N(N-1)n,
where the last term is the contribution of the coadjoint orbits .
Let
 be the set of the
gauge orbits acting on the base space .
Consider smooth functionals  annihilated by the
anchor action .
These functionals generate the space of sections of the linear bundle
 we
discussed before (). It  is the determinant bundle
 .
The prequantization of  is defined in the Hilbert space
 .

On the other hand  can be described by the
cohomology  of the BRST operator  which we are going to define.
Let  be the  dual to  fields (the ghosts)
and  are their momenta .
 Consider the algebra




Then the BRST operator  acts on functionals on this algebra as



 where



where res.


Projective structures on  

Consider the space  of
projective connections  on . Locally  on a punctured disk
 the space  is  represented by
the set  of the second order differential operators .
The later is the Poisson manifold
with the linear brackets
vir 
T(z),T(w)=(1 2 ^3+2T+T)(z-w),
 where  is the delta function
 on the contour .

 The dual space to   is the  Virasoro algebra 
  . The commutation relations can be read off
 from the Poisson brackets  (see ())
8.7b 
[_1,_2]=(_1_2-_2_1, 1 2 _1^3_2).
 The coadjoint action of  on 
8.7 
_ T(z,)=-T-2T1 2 ^3.
defines the anchor in the trivial algebroid .

The algebroid (), () can be  defined
globally over the space .  The section of the algebroid are the chiral
vector fields  on .  Its central
extension is defined by the contour in  ().
 We call this algebra .
We include in the definition the contribution of the marked points.
Assume that the projective connections  have
poles at the marked points 
  up to the second order:
8.8a 
T_zx_a T^a_-2  (z-x_a)^2 +T^a_-1  (z-x_a) +,
and the vector fields have the first order holomorphic nulls at the marked points
8.8b 
_zx_a =r_a(z-x_a)+o(z-x_a),  r_a0.
We denote this trivial algebroid bundle  .

Consider the cohomology .
Due to () and ()   and thereby
  in () represents an element
from .

The anchor action () can be extended by the one-cocycle 
representing a nontrivial element  of 
8.9a 
c(T;)=__g,n  T=T,
8.9 
 _ f(T)=_Tdf(T)+c(T;).
The contribution of the marked point in () is .

There exist   nontrivial two-cocycles defined by the integrals
over non contractible contours :



The cocycles give rise to the central extension  of the Lie algebra
of the first order differential operators on .

The affinization  over the cotangent bundle  has
the Darboux coordinates
 and ,
where  is the Beltrami differential.
The anchor () is lifted to  as
8.11 
_++,
where the last term occurs due to the cocycle ().
We specify the dependence of  on the positions of
the marked points in the following  way. Let  be
 neighborhoods
 of the marked points 
such that  for .
Define a smooth function 
cf 
_a(z,)=
 
.
Due to () at the neighborhoods of the marked points  is defined
 up to the term
 .
Then  can be represented as
mu 
 a=1 ^n[t^(1) _0,a +t^(1) _1,a (z-x_a)+]^0_a,  
^0_a=_a(z,),  (t_0,a =x_a-x_a^0),
where only  can not be removed by the gauge transformations (), ().
The symplectic form on  is



For rational curves  it takes the form
8.14 
-2 dt_1,a +dT^a_-1 dt_0,a .
 
The space  is the classical phase space
of the -gravity on . In fact,
 is related to the conformal class of metrics on 
and plays the role of a coordinate, while  is a momentum.
In our construction  and  interchange their roles.

The Hamiltonian of the canonical transformations (), ()
has the form
8.12 
h_F(T,),





The Hamiltonian defines the moment map  
8.13 
m=(++2)T-1 2 ^3,
where  is the dual to  space
of distributions  of -forms on .
As it follows from
() in the neighborhoods of the marked points the elements
  takes the form
8.13a 
yb_1,a (x_a)+b_2,a ^2(x_a)+.
We put  equal
8.15 
m=-_a=1 ^nT^a_-2 (x_a),  (m=F(T,)).
The algebra    preserves 
for any .
Thus, in contrast with the previous example, we have trivial coadjoint orbits at
the marked points. Since  are fixed, the dynamical parameters  are
 that contribute in the symplectic structure ().
Let  be a  differential. Then ()
is the compatibility condition for the linear system
8.16 

 
.
It follows from the second equation that the Beltrami differential  provides
 the deformation of complex structure on . Note, that we started
from the first equation defining the projective
connection  and  on . The last equation is modified
after the passage from  to  .


The moduli space  of projective structure on  is
the symplectic quotient of  with respect to the action of ,
where  is the group corresponding to the algebra 



It has dimension . To quantize 
 one can consider the quotient space .
 The space of sections of
the linear bundle  is defined as the space of
functionals  on  that satisfy the invariance condition

.
The linear bundle  is the determinant line bundle
 considered in.

The tangent space  to  is isomorphic
to the cohomology  of the BRST complex. It is generated by
the fields , the ghosts fields  dual to the
vector fields  acting via the anchor (),()
on  and the ghosts momenta .
The BRST operator  is defined by 



The first term is just the Hamiltonian (), where the vector fields are
replaced by the ghosts.

Hamiltonian algebroid structure in -gravity 

Now consider the concrete example of the general construction with nontrivial
algebroid structure.
It is the -structures on which generalize the projective structures described in previous Section.
In this Section we consider in details the -structures.

-opers 

Opers are -bundles over Riemann curves with additional structures
.
Let  be a  -bundle over . It is a -oper  if
 there exists a flag filtration
 and a covariant derivative,
 that acts as
.
Moreover,  induces an isomorphism
.
It means that locally
opN 
(
 
).
In other word we define the -order differential operator on 
dopN 
L_N=^N-W_2^N-2  ^(-N-1 2 ,0) (_g,n )^(N+1 2 ,0) (_g,n )
with vanishing subprinciple symbol. The -opers come from the -bundles
and have the additional term  in ().
We assume that in  neighborhoods  of the marked points
the coefficients  behave as
6.4a 
W_j_zx_a W^a_-j (j)(z-x_a)^j +W^a_-j (j-1)(z-x_a)^j-1  +
.
In this section we consider -opers and postpone the general case to next Section.
It is possible to choose .
Instead of () we have
6.1 
-0 1 0 0 0 1 W T 0 ,
and the third order differential operator
6.2 
L_3=^3-T(-1,0) (_g,n )^(2,0) (_g,n ).
According with ()
6.3 
T_zx_a T^a_-2  (z-x_a)^2 +T^a_-1  (z-x_a) +.
6.4 
W_zx_a W^a_-3  (z-x_a)^3 +W^a_-2  (z-x_a)^2 +W^a_-1  (z-x_a) 
+.
Local Lie algebroid over SL-opers 

Consider the set  of -opers on a punctured disk .
This set is a Poisson manifold with respect to the AGD brackets
6.9a 
T(z),T(w)
=(-2^3+2T(z)+T(z))(z-w),
6.10a 
T(z),W(w)=(^4-T(z)^2+3W(z)W(z))(z-w),
6.12a 
W(z),W(w)=










It means that  is a base of the local Lie algebroid
.
To define the space of its sections we consider
the dual space   of the space of second order differential operators on  with a central extensions




It comes from the pairing
pa 
_z=1 (^(1) T+ ^(2) W)
and the central element  is dual to the highest order coefficient
in() which we put equal to .
The Lie brackets on  are determined by means of
the AGD Poisson structure following  ()
6.6 
^(1) _1,^(1) _2((^(1) _1^(1) _2-^(1) _2^(1) _1) d dz ,
-2^(1) _1^3^(1) _2).
6.7 
^(1) ,^(2) -^(2) ^2^(1) ) d dz +( -2^(2) ^(1) +^(1) ^(2) ) d^2 dz^2 ),
^(1) _1^4^(2) _2).
6.8 
^(2) _1,^(2) _22 3 [(^2-T)^(2) _1]^(2) _2 -
 2 3 [(^2-T)^(2) _2]^(2) _1) d dz . +





Note, that the brackets () are the Virasoro brackets and the whole
set of the commutation relations is their generalization on the second order
differential operators.

According with () the anchor action in  has the form
6.9 
_^(1)  T=-2^3^(1) +2T^(1) +T^(1) ,
6.10 
_^(1)  W=-^4^(1) +3W^(1) +W^(1) +T^2^(1) ,
6.11 
_^(2)  T=^4^(2) -T^2^(2) +(3W-2T)^(2) +
(2W-^2T)^(2) ,
6.12 
_^(2)  W=2 3 ^5^(2) -4 3 T^3^(2) -
2T^2^(2) +




Thereby, we come to the Lie algebroid  over .
This algebroid is nontrivial since
the structure functions in () depend on  the projective connection .

The SAJI () in  takes the form
6.14 
^(2) _1,^(2) _2,^(2) _3^(1) -
(^(2) _1^(2) _2-^(2) _2^(2) _1)_^(2) _3 T+c.p. (1,2,3)
=0,
6.15 
^(2) _1,^(2) _2,^(1) _3^(1) -
(^(2) _1^(2) _2-^(2) _2^(2) _1)_^(1) _3 T=0.
The brackets here correspond to the product of
structure functions in the left hand side
of () and the superscript  corresponds to the  component.
For the  rest  brackets the Jacobi identity is the standard one.

The origin of the brackets and the anchor representations follow from the
matrix description of -opers ().
Consider the set  of automorphisms of the bundle  over 
6.15a 
Af^-1 f-f^-1 Af,
that preserve the -oper structure
6.16 
f^-1 f-
f^-1 0 1 0 0 0 1 W T 0 f=
0 1 0 0 0 1 W' T' 0 .
It is clear that  is the Lie groupoid over   with
, , .
The left identity map is the   subgroup of 



where  is an arbitrary matrix from  and  has the oper structure ().
The right identity map has the same
form with  replaced by .

The local version of () takes the form
6.17 
X-[0 1 0 0 0 1 W T 0 ,X]=
0 0 0 0 0 0 W T 0 .
It is the sixth order linear differential system for the matrix elements of the
traceless matrix . The matrix elements 
 depend on two arbitrary fields . The
solution takes the form
6.17b 
X=x_11  x_12  ^(2)  x_21  x_22  
^(1)  x_31  x_32  x_33  ,

















The matrix elements of the commutator , 
give rise to the brackets (),
(), (). Simultaneously,
from () one obtain the anchor action ()-().

Lie algebroid over SL-opers 


As in the previous examples, we can define the global algebroid  over
the space of opers . The space of sections
 are the
second order differential operators on .
We assume that  
vanish holomorphically at the marked points as
6.5 
^(1) r^(1) _a(z-x_a)+o(z-x_a),  
^(2) r^(2) _a(z-x_a)^2+o(z-x_a)^2  r^(j) 0.
Note that these asymptotics are consistent with the Lie brackets and with asymptotics of
 () and  ().

Consider the cohomology of .
There exists a nontrivial cocycle corresponding to 
with two components
6.17a 
c^(1) =__g,n  ^(1) T,
  c^(2) =__g,n  ^(2) W.
It follows from (), () and () that the contributions
 from the marked points are equal





The cocycle leads to the shift of the anchor action





There exists the  central extensions  of  ,
provided by the nontrivial cocycles from  . They are the
non-contractible contour integrals 
6.16a 
c_(^(j) _1,^(k) _2)=__ (^(j) _1,^(k) _2),
  (j,k=1,2),
where








It can be proved that 
() and that  are not exact. The proof is based on the matrix realization
of  () and the two-cocycle () of .
These cocycles allow us to construct the extended brackets:






Hamiltonian algebroid over -gravity 

Let  be the affinization over the cotangent bundle 
 to the space of -opers . The dual fields are the Beltrami differentials
 and the differentials .
We assume that   near the marked points 
 has the form
6.19 
_zx_a (t^(2) _a,0 +t^(2) _a,1 (z-x^0_a))_a(z,),
and  as before satisfies ().
The space    is the classical phase space for the -gravity
. The symplectic form on  has the canonical form




According to the general theory the anchor ()-()
can be lifted from  to .
This lift is nontrivial owing to the cocycle ().
It follows from () that the anchor action on  and
 takes the form
6.21 
_^(1)   ^(1) -^(1) +^(1) -
^2^(1) ,
6.22 
_^(1)  (1) +^(1) ,
6.23 
_^(2)  (2) -2 3 [((^2-T))^(2) 
-((^2-T)^(2) )],
6.24 
_^(2)   ^(2) +(^2^(2) -^2^(2) )
+2^(2) -^(2) .
There are two Hamiltonians, defining by the anchor




After the integration by parts they take the form




where , 
F1 
F^(1) =-T-^4+T^2T)


F2 
F^(2) =-W-2 5 ^5+4 3 T^3+2T^2+
(-2 3 T^2+2^2 T-2W)+




The Hamiltonians carry out the moment map



The elements of the dual space  are singular at the marked points. In addition
to  () there are  dual to  ()



Let  is defined as in () and



Then the coadjoint action of  preserve .
The moduli space   of the -gravity
( -geometry) is the symplectic quotient with respect to
the groupoid
 action



It has dimension is
.
The term  comes from the coefficients
, and the dual to them
,   in () and ().


The moment equations  are the consistency conditions
for the linear system
6.26a 

 
.
where . We will prove this statement below.
The last equation  represents the deformation of the antiholomorphic
operator  (or more general  as in ())
by the second order differential
operator . The left hand side is the exact form of the deformed operator
when it acts on . This deformation cannot
be supported by the structure of a Lie algebra  and one leaves with
the algebroid symmetries.

The prequantization of  can be realized in the space of sections
of a linear bundle  over the space of orbits
 . The sections are functionals
 on  such that
.
The bundle  can be identified with the determinant bundle
 .


Instead of the symplectic reduction one can apply the BRST construction.
The cohomology of the moduli space   are
isomorphic to
. To construct the BRST complex we introduce the ghosts
fields  and their momenta .
Then it follows from Theorem 2.1 that for




the operator   is nilpotent and define the BRST cohomology
in the complex



Chern-Simons derivation 

We follow here the derivation of -gravity proposed in Ref..
We only add in the construction a contribution of the Wilson lines
 due to the presence of the marked points on .

Consider the Chern-Simons functional on 





 Introduce  Wilson lines 
along the time directions and located at the marked points



In the hamiltonian picture the components
 are elements of the phase space
 with the symplectic form
() while  is the Lagrange multiplier for the first class constraints
().

The phase space  can be derived from the Chern-Simons phase space.
 The flatness condition () generates
the gauge transformations
5.31 
Af^-1 f-f^-1 Af,  f^-1 f-f^-1 f,  
p_af_a^-1 p_af_a,  g_ag_af_a.
The result of the gauge fixing with respect to the whole gauge group 
is the moduli
space  of the flat  bundles over .

Let  be the maximal parabolic subgroup of  of the form



and  be the corresponding gauge group.
First, we partly fix the gauge with respect to .
A generic connection  can be gauge transformed by  to
  the form ().
It follows from () that  has simple poles at the marked points.
To come to 
one should respect the behavior of the matrix elements at the marked points
(), (). For this purpose we use an additional singular gauge transform
by the diagonal matrix



The resulting gauge group we denote .

The form of  can be read off from ()
5.32 
a_11  
a_12  
- 
a_21  
a_22  
- 
a_31  
a_32  
a_33  ,















The flatness ()  for the special choice  () and
 () gives rise to
the moment constraints . Namely, one has
 (),  (),
while the other matrix
elements of  vanish identically.
At the same time, the matrix linear
system () coincides with  ().
In this way, we come to the matrix description of the moduli space
.

The cocycles  () can be derived from
the two-cocycle () of . Substituting in ()
the matrix realization of  (), one come to ().

The groupoid action on  plays the role of the rest gauge
transformations that complete the  action to the  action.
The algebroid symmetry arises in this theory as a result of the partial
gauge fixing by . Thus we come to the following diagram










The tangent space to  at the point 
coincides with the tangent space to  at the point
. Their dimension is . But their global
structure is different and the diagram cannot be closed by the horizontal
isomorphisms. The interrelations between  and 
were analyzed in.

-gravity and general deformations of complex structures 

In this section we present the general deformation of complex
structures by the Volterra operators. To construct the Lie algebroid over
 the space of -opers we use another form of the pairing. Instead of the
differential operators and the pairing () we consider the Volterra operators
 that come from the pairing ().
We start with the description of the local AGD algebroid following Ref.
 and then give its global version. The passage from the Lie
algebroid to the corresponding Hamiltonian algebroid allows us to describe
the deformations of the complex structures.


Local AGD algebroid  

Consider the set  of pseudo-differential symbols on the disk .
It is a ring of formal Laurent series




9.1 
X(z,)=_k=- ^ra_k(z)^k,  
( a_k(z)^-N-k (D^*) .
 The multiplication on  is defined as the non-commutative
multiplication of their symbols
pr 
X(z,)Y(z,)=
_k0 1k! ^k ^k  X(z,)^k z^k Y(z,).
In what follows we drop the multiplication symbol .

Note that  can be considered as the formal map
of the sheaves
B 
B_r,N (D^*) : ^N+1 2  ^-N-1 2  .
Let  be -oper on . Then we have




where the product is defined as (). There is the functional
on 
pa1 
L_NX2 _z=1  Res (L_NX)dz,
where . The important property is that
.

The AGD brackets on the space  of -opers
 are defined as follows.
The space of section of  can be identified
with  the quotient space of the Volterra operators
9.1a 
(T^*M^G_N(D^*))= B_0,N (D^*)/B_-N-2,N (D^*)
For  and  define the functional
.
In particular, .
The AGD brackets have the form
9.2 
l_X,l_Y=L_NX(L_NY)_+-XL_N(YL_N)_+,
where  is the differential part of .

Using the general prescription we define the Lie brackets
() in the space  of sections of 
9.3 
X,Yand the anchor map
9.4

We can rewrite () in the form of the "Poisson-Lie brackets"



The coefficient  arises from the quadratic form of the Poisson bivector.

In this way we have constructed the local Lie algebroid 
over the space of the local  opers .

To be the -oper  should satisfy the second
class constraints



since . The functional 
generates the vector field on 




If  the transformed oper is the -oper.
It means that .
In this way the brackets () is the generalization of () 
and ()-()  on arbitrary .
The relations between the Poisson manifolds  and 
were discussed also in Ref..

Poisson sigma-model 

Here we construct the Poisson sigma-model with the target space 
following 3.2 .
We modify the notion of  assuming that instead of ()
we have
B1 
B_(r,N,1) (D^*)= B_r,N (D^*)K (D^*),  
B_(r,N,1) (D^*):
^(N+1 2 ,1) ^(-N-1 2 ,1) .
The affinization  of 
is defined by the pair of fields ,
 where 
is the dual field to an oper with respect to the integral over .
The space  is the phase space of the Poisson sigma model
with the canonical symplectic form
9.6 
D^* Res (DL_N D) .
The one-cocycle 
9.5 
c(L,Y)=_D^* Res(YL_N),  (YB_0,N )
provides the lift of the anchor action () on 
9.7 
_YY+
Y(L_N)_+-(L_N)_+Y+(YL_N)_+Along with () this action defines the canonical transformations
of (). They are generated by the Hamiltonian
9.8 
h_Y= _D^*  Res(_YL_N)+ c(L,Y)=
_D^*  Res(Y (
L_N-(L_N)_+L_N+L_N(L_N)_+)
).
This expression yields  the anchor map of the Hamiltonian
algebroid 
related to . The canonical transformations by 



 corresponding to the form () are generated by
 the first class constraints
9.9 
F:=L_N-(L_N)_+L_N+L_N(L_N)_+=0.
Define the operator
9.11 
A=^(N+1 2 ,0)  (D^*)^(N+1 2 ,1)  (D^*)
and the dual operator




Let , ,

 Following Lemma 3.2 we conclude that the quadratic constraints
() are equivalent to the linear problem

.
The second equation can be replaced on
9.12 
(+(L_N)_+)^+(z,)=0.
In this way the local oper  along with the dual element 
defines the deformation of the complex structure  on the disk .
The second equation () is equivalent to the deformed
holomorphity condition for the sections .


Let  be the Hamiltonian Lie groupoid corresponding to
.
The reduced phase space is the symplectic quotient




Global algebroid 

As we have noted in previous Section the -opers are well defined
on the curve .
The global algebroid  over the space of -opers 
on  is independent on the choice of .
The space of its sections  is the
space of the Volterra operators on  with smooth
coefficients (see()).
Near a marked point  with a local coordinate  for

where



The anchor action of  is defined as before by ().

The one-cocycle representing  comes from
 the integration over 




Let








The affinization 
of

.
Near the marked points








The symplectic form on   is



The anchor action on  () can be lifted from 
to  as canonical transformations of .   They are generated by the Hamiltonians



In addition to () we have the action on the dual variables are
9.4a 
_Y h_Y,.
The Hamiltonians can be represented in the form



where  is defined by ().
They lead to the moment map




We take



where  are defined in (). The moment equation

 is equivalent to the linear problem (), () on .
In this way we come to the deformed  operator
  acting on the space
 .

The moduli space of the generalized
complex structures is a part of the symplectic quotient
,
where  is the corresponding Hamiltonian groupoid. The cohomology of
 are defined by the BRST operator






where  is the ghost field corresponding to the gauge field 
and  is its momenta.

Concluding Remarks 
 Let summarize the results and discuss some open problems.

(i)
The Hamiltonian algebroid is a bundle over a Poisson manifold with a
Lie algebra structure on its sections and the anchor map to the Hamiltonian
vector fields.
 The special kind of the Hamiltonian algebroids are defined over
affine space of
cotangent bundles. They are lift of the Lie algebroids defined over
the base of the cotangent bundles.
The lifts are classified by the first cohomology of the Lie algebroids.
The Hamiltonian algebroids  of this type are most closed to the Lie algebras
of Hamiltonian vector fields and has the same structure of the BRST operator.

(ii) The Lie algebroid over the space of -opers on a Riemann curve with
marked points has the space of the second order differential operators as
the space of its sections. It contains the Lie subalgebra of the first order
differential operators. After change the behavior of their coefficients
at the marked points this subalgebra coincides with the Krichever-Novikov
algebra. It will be interesting to lift this correspondence to the
second order differential operators. Another open question is the structure of
opers and Lie algebroids defined on Riemann curves with double marked points.

(iii) In the limit  the structure
of the strongly homotopy Lie algebras
 should be recovered. In our approach this limit looks obscure.

(iv) The Chern-Simons derivation of the Hamiltonian algebroid in -gravity
explain the origin of the algebroid symmetry as a result of the two step gauge
fixing. It will be plausible to have the same universal construction for
an arbitrary Poisson sigma-model.
