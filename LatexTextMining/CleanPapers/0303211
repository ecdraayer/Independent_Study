ABSTRACT 

       We obtain smooth M-theory solutions whose geometry
is a warped product of AdS and a compact internal space that
can be viewed as an  bundle over .  The bundle can be
trivial or twisted, depending on the even or odd values of the two
diagonal monopole charges.  The solution preserves 
supersymmetry and is dual to an   superconformal
field theory, providing a concrete framework to study the
AdS/CFT correspondence in M-theory. We construct analogous
embeddings of AdS, AdS and AdS in massive type IIA,
type IIB and M-theory, respectively. The internal spaces have
generalized holonomy and can be viewed as  bundles over 
for , 5 and 7. Surprisingly, the dimensions of spaces with
generalized holonomy includes . We also obtain a large class
of solutions of AdS.

Introduction 

         AdS spacetime arises naturally in type IIB supergravity,
which provides a non-trivial and relatively simple framework for
examining the holographic principle via  the AdS/CFT
correspondence.  The embedding of AdS
spacetime in eleven-dimensional supergravity has also been studied
in the past.  A smooth but non-supersymmetric compactification of
eleven-dimensional supergravity to AdS was obtained in
 where the internal space is a Kahler manifold. More
recently, an internal background of  was found in
. Although the compactification is not supersymmetric at
the level of supergravity, it was argued in that it is
fully supersymmetric at the level of M-theory, since it is T-dual
to the AdS of type IIB theory.  In the above two
examples, the AdS spacetime and internal manifold are direct
products without warp factors. Smooth but non-supersymmetric
M-theory solutions have been constructed in,
which are warped and twisted products of AdS or
AdS with a squashed four-sphere.

In, supersymmetric embeddings of AdS in M-theory
were found as warped geometries with a compact internal metric.
This construction can be understood from that the fact that 
can be expressed as a foliation of  and .  One can then
T-dualize the AdS of type IIB theory on the 
bundle of the  and obtain a solution in M-theory.
However, there is a naked singularity in such a construction,
since the  circle of the  can shrink to zero.
Supersymmetric and smooth embeddings of AdS in M-theory were
obtained in.  The eleven-dimensional metric is a warped
product of AdS with an internal metric that can be viewed as
an  bundle over , a hyperbolic 2-plane.  The
construction can give rise to both  and 
supersymmetry.

       In this letter, we report a supersymmetric and smooth
compactification of M-theory to AdS, with the internal space being
an  bundle over .  The construction is only possible for
 supersymmetry, and hence it gives rise to the minimum
AdS gauged supergravity coupled to matter.  This solution provides
a supergravity dual to   superconformal field theory.
We also obtain supersymmetric and smooth compactifications of M-theory
to AdS and type IIB to AdS. The internal space is an 
bundle over , where  and , respectively. We also
construct a supersymmetric compactification of massive IIA to AdS,
which is singular.

AdS in M-theory 

      We begin by considering the sector of  gauged supergravity
with two diagonal  vector fields.  The relevant Lagrangian is
given by

e^-1 L _7 = R - 12 (_1)^2 -
12 (_2)^2 -
V -14 _i=1 ^2 X_i^-2  (F_^i)^2,

where  with

a_1=(2, 25 ),a_2=(-2, 25 ).

The scalar potential  is given by
V =g^2 (-4X_1 X_2 - 2 X_0 X_1 - 2 X_0 X_2 + 12
X_0^2) , 
where .  The potential can be expressed in
terms of the superpotential

W=g 2  (X_0 + 2X_1 + 2 X_2).

We now consider a 3-brane ansatz

ds^2&=&e^2u  dx^ dx_+ e^2v 
^-2  d_2^2 +d^2,

F_^i&=& m_i ^-2  _,
where the constant  takes the values 1,  and 0, if
 is the metric for a unit , hyperbolic  or
2-torus .  is the corresponding volume form. The
system admits the following first-order equations


d d  &=& 2(- 22 
(m_1 a_1 X_1^-1  + m_2 a_2 X_2^-1 )
e^-2v  + dW d ),

dv d  &=& -1 52  (22
(m_1 X_1^-1  + m_2 X_2^-1 ) e^-2v  +
W),

du d  &=& 1 52  (
 2 (m_1 X_1^-1  + m_2 X_2^-1 )
e^-2v  - W), 
provided that the constraint

^2=(m_1 + m_2) g
is satisfied.  This set of first-order equations were derived for the
case of  in by studying the Killing spinor equations
of  gauged supergravity.  In, a different method was
used to obtain them for ,  and .  The equations of
() were analysed in detail in.  Here, we report
on only a subclass of solutions where  and  are
constants.  In this case, for , the solution is nothing but
AdS written in Poincare coordinates.

         For , we find that the solution is given by

e^2 _1  &=&
m_2 - m_1 m_2^2 + m_1^2 - m_1 m_2  m_2 ,e^-52  _2  = 43(_1/2),

e^-2v  &=& - g e^-310  _2  
m_1 e^-_1 2   + m_2 e^_1 
2   ,u=-12g e^-410  _2 
. 
This solution is invariant under the simultaneous interchanges of
 and .  The
reality conditions of the solution constrain the constants  and
, as well as the choice of  in the solution.  Let us first
consider the case , corresponding to  as the
metric of a unit (non-compact) hyperbolic 2-plane.  In this case, the
reality of the solution implies that .  This includes
the choice of  (or ) and , which were discussed
in.  The first case gives rise to 
supersymmetry in , whilst the second case gives rise to 
 supersymmetry.

         We are particularly interested in a compact internal space.
Thus, we now turn to the choice of , corresponding to
 as the metric of .  In this case, the reality
conditions for () imply that .  The condition
() implies further that .  Therefore, the
AdS solution can only have  supersymmetry,
but cannot arise from the pure  minimal gauged supergravity.

        If we define a charge parameter , then the
condition for having  versus  can be summarised as

q[0,2] && H^2,

q(-,0) or  (2,) &&
S^2. 

      It is straightforward to lift this solution to  by using
the ansatz obtained in.  Since the solutions for
general  are rather complicated to present, we only consider a
representative example with  and .  The M-theory
metric is given by

ds_11 ^2 &=& ^13 [ds_AdS_5  ^2 +
1 g^2 c   1 4c 
(d^2 + ^2 d^2)

&&+ 1  (14 d_0^2 +
15(d_1^2 + _1^2 (d_1 -52  d)^2)

&& + d_2^2 + _2^2 (d_2 + 32 d)^2
) ], 
where  and  are spherical coordinates which
satisfy .  The warp factor  is
given by

(4_0^2 + 5 _1^2 + _2^2)>0.

The AdS metric is given by

ds_AdS_5  ^2 = e^-2 R   dx^ dx_+
d^2,

where the AdS radius is given by .  The 4-form field
strength in  can also be obtained using the reduction ansatz in
.  It is given by

*F _ &=& -(2g)^-1 (8_0^2 + 15_1^2 + 7_2^2)
_ dd

&&+ g^-1  (15 d(_1^2)(d_1 -52  d) - 3d(_2^2)(d_2 + 32  d))_.
where  is the volume form for the AdS metric.

     Thus, the internal space of the  metric can be viewed as an
 bundle over , with two diagonal  bundles.  In
general, the internal metric can be labeled by 
.  In the specific
example above,  and the solution is smooth
everywhere.  For general , the metric does not have a
power-law singularity. However, it could have a conical orbifold
singularity, which is absent only if  are integers.  Since
the  satisfy the constraint , it follows that they
are either both even or both odd integers. In the even case, the
bundle is topologically trivial, whilst it is twisted for the odd
case.

AdS in massive type IIA 

          The scalar potential in gauged supergravity with two 
isometries was obtained in.  From this, we deduce that
the relevant Lagrangian involving the two  vector fields is
given by

e^-1 L _6 = R - 12 (_1)^2 -
12 (_2)^2 -
V -14 _i=1 ^2 X_i^-2  (F_^i)^2,

where  with

a_1=(2, 12 ),a_2=(-2, 12 ).

The scalar potential is given by

V=49 g^2 (X_0^2 - 9 X_1 X_2 - 6 X_0 X_1 - 6 X_0 X_2),

where .  As in the previous case, the scalar
potential can be expressed in terms of the superpotential

W=g 2 (43 X_0 + 2 X_1 + 2 X_2).


      We consider a membrane solution of the type given by
().  The system admits the following first-order
equations

d d  &=& 2(- 22 
(m_1 a_1 X_1^-1  + m_2 a_2 X_2^-1 )
e^-2v  + dW d ),

dv d  &=& -1 42  (32 
(m_1 X_1^-1  + m_2 X_2^-1 ) e^-2v  +
W),

du d  &=& 1 42  (
 2 (m_1 X_1^-1  + m_2 X_2^-1 )
e^-2v  - W), 
provided that the constraint  is satisfied. The
solutions were analysed in detail in.  Here, we shall
only consider the subset of solutions with constant scalars.  For
, one just reproduces the AdS metric in Poincare
coordinates.  For , we have

e ^2 _1 &=&3 2  m_2-m_1(m_2-m_1)^2+4 9 m_1 m_2   m_2 ,e ^-2 _2 =3 2  cosh (_1 2  ),

e ^-2v &=& -4g e ^-_2 2    m_1 e ^-_1 2   +m_2 e ^_1 2    ,u=-g 3 e ^-3 8  _2 . 
As in the  result, we can define a charge parameter
.  We have  or  depending on the
following condition:

q[0,2] && H^2,

q(-,0) or  (2,) &&
S^2.  
When  or , the system has  supersymmetry.
Otherwise, we have  supersymmetry.

         Using the reduction ansatz in, it is
straightforward to lift the solution back to , giving rise to a
solution of massive type IIA supergravity.  The metric is given by

ds_10 ^2 &=& _0^112   X_0^18  (X_1
X_2)^14  ^38  [ds_6^2 + g^-2 
^-1 
(X_0^-1  d_0^2

&&+X_1^-1  (d_1^2 + _1^2(d_1 + gA_^2)^2) +
X_2^-1  (d_2^2 + _2^2(d_2 + gA_^1)^2))]
,
where  and 
.  Thus, the  metric is a warped product of
AdS with an internal six-metric, which is an  bundle over
 or , depending on the charge parameter , according to
the rule ().

As an example of a supersymmetric, though singular,
compactification of AdS from massive IIA, we can take 
and , and a choice of negative sign in
(). This gives ,  and ,
where . Also, 
 and 
, and the radius of AdS is given by
.

AdS in type IIB 

Let us now consider the  minimal gauged supergravity
coupled to two vector multiplets. The Lagrangian is given by

e^-1 L _5=R - 12 (_1)^2 -12 (_2)^2 - 14_i=1 ^3 X_i^-2  (F_^i)^2 - V +
e^-1  14 ^  F^1_ F^2_  A^3_, 
where  with

a_1=(2, 2 6 ), a_2=(-2,26 ),a_3=(0,- 46 ).

The scalar potential is given by

V=-4g^2 _i=1 ^3
         X_i^-1 .
The scalar potential  can also be expressed in terms of
the superpotential

W=2 g _i X_i.

We find that the string solution of the type given by ()
admits the following first-order equations

d d  &=&
2(- 22  (m_1 a_1 X_1^-1 
+ m_2 a_2 X_2^-1  + m_3 a_3 X_3^-1 )e^-2v 
+
dW d ),

dv d  &=& -1 32 
(2 (m_1 X_1^-1  +
m_2 X_2^-1  + m_3 X_3^-1 ) e^-2v  + W),

du d  &=& 1 32  (
 2 (m_1 X_1^-1  + m_2 X_2^-1  + m_3
X_3^-1 ) e^-2v  - W), 
provided that the constraint  is
satisfied. The general solution for this system was analysed in
. Here, we consider only the solutions with constant
scalar fields.  For , the solution is AdS in
Poincare coordinates.  For , fixed-point solutions exist
only for non-vanishing . The solution is given by

e^2 _1  &=& m_1 m_2  (m_3+m_2-m_1 m_3 -
m_2 + m1 ),e^6 _2  = m_1m_2(m_3^2 - (m_1-m_2)^2) 
m_3^2(m_1 + m_2 - m_3)^2 ,

e^-2v &=&-g((m_1 + m_2 - m_3)(m_3^2 -
(m_1-m_2)^2) m_1^2m_2^2m_3^2 )^13 ,

u&=& -g e^_2 6   ((_1/2) +
12 e^-32 _2 ) .

The reality condition of the solution implies that when three vectors
with the magnitudes  can form a triangle,  should
be the  metric. On the other hand, when they cannot form a
triangle, the metric should be that of .(AdS
 solutions were also recently found in in a different
construction.)   If any of the  vanish, there is no fixed-point
solution, except when one vanishes with the remaining two equal
.

        Using the reduction ansatz obtained in, we
can easily lift the solution back to .  Since the solution
with general  is complicated to present, we consider a
simpler case with .  The  type IIB metric is

ds_10 ^2&=&   ds_AdS_3  ^2 +g^-2 
(m_1 m_3-2m_1 )^1/3  (12 q_1 d_2^2 + d^2)

&&+ g^-2 ^-1 [ c^-1/3  ^2(d^2 + ^2 (d_1 + 12 q_1 A_)^2

&& +^2 (d_2 + 12 q_1 A_)^2) +
c^2/3  ^2 (d_3 + 12 q_3
A_)^2], 
where

&&c=m_1 2m_1-m_3 ,1/3  ^2+ c^-2/3  ^2>0,dA_=_,

&&ds_AdS_3  ^2 = e^-2 R  , (-dt^2 + dx^2) +
d^2, R=2m_1 g(4m_1-m_3) c^1/3  

We have introduced the charge parameters 
, and hence they satisfy the constraint .  In
the above solution, if , we should have ,
corresponding to ; if , we should have
, corresponding to .  In general, the internal metric
is an  bundle over  or , depending the values of the
 according to the above rules.



AdS in M-theory 

      Let us now consider the  gauged  supergravity in
four dimensions. The Lagrangian is given by

e^-1 L _4=R - 12 (_1)^2 -12 (_2)^2 -12 (_3)^2 -14_i=1 ^4 X_i^-2 
(F_^i)^2 - V , 
where  with

a_1=(1, 1, 1),a_2=(1, -1, -1),a_3=(-1, 1,
-1),a_4=(-1, -1, 1).

The scalar potential is given by

V=-4g^2 _i<j  X_i X_j,  
which can also be expressed in terms of the superpotential

W=2 g _i=1 ^4 X_i. 
The magnetic black hole solution of the type given by
() admits the following first-order equations

d d  &=&
2(- 22  _i=1 ^4 m_i a_i X_i^-1  e^-2v  +
dW d ),

dv d  &=& -1 22 
( 2  
_i=1 ^4 m_i X_i^-1  e^-2v  + W),

du d  &=& 1 22  (
 2  _i=1 ^4 m_i X_i^-1  e^-2v  -
W),  
provided that the constraint  is
satisfied. The general solution for this system was analysed in
. Here, we consider only solutions with constant scalar
fields.  For , the solution is AdS in Poincare
coordinates.  For , we have not obtained the general
solution for abitrary , although we have found many examples of
specific solutions.  We do find a class of special solutions by
setting .  This enables us to consistently set
. For this truncation, fixed-point
solutions for  are given by

e ^2   &=& 3m_2-m_1(m_1-m_2)(m_1-9m_2)  2m_2 ,e ^-2v = 4g  sinh   m_1 e ^-2 -m_2 ,

u&=& -12g( 2(m_1 e ^-3 2  +3m_2 e ^1 2  ) m_2-m_1
e ^-2   sinh  +e ^3 2  +3e ^-1 2  ) .

The reality condition of the solution implies that for ,
corresponding to , we must have either  and 
 or  and .  For ,
corresponding to , we must have  and .
The AdS has also been found in.

        Using the reduction ansatz obtained in, we
can easily lift the solution back to  with the metric

ds_11 ^2 &=& ^2/3  ds_AdS_2  ^2 +e ^2v  (m_1+3m_2)g d_2^2

& &+1 g^2   [ e ^-3 2  ( d_1^2+_1^2(d_1+
m_1 m_1+3m_2  A_)^2 )

& &+e ^1 2   _i=2 ^4 ( d_i^2+_i^2
(d_i + m_2 m_1+3m_2  A_)^2 ) ]
, 
where

&=& (e ^3 2  -e ^-1 2  )_1^2+e ^-1 2  >0,
dA_=_,ds_AdS_2  ^2 = -e^-2 R   dt^2 + d^2,


R &=& 2 g  [ 2(m_1 e ^-3 2  +3m_2
e ^1 2  ) m_2-m_1 e ^-2   sinh 
+e ^3 2  +3e ^-1 2  ]^-1 .

In general, the internal metric is an  bundle over  or
, depending the values of the .


Conclusions 

      We have obtained a large class of supersymmetric embeddings of
AdS spacetime in M-theory, as well as type IIB and massive type
IIA theories.  The internal spaces can be viewed as  bundles
over  or .  Similar solutions have been discussed in
.  In particular, we have
found a smooth embedding of AdS in M-theory, with a compact
internal space of an  bundle over .  The bundle can be
trivial or twisted, depending on the two diagonal monopole
charges.  The solution preserves  supersymmetry; it is
a supergravity dual to an ,  superconformal field
theory on the boundary of AdS. This provides a concrete
framework to study AdS/CFT from the point of view of
M-theory.

        The internal spaces of these embeddings may
be regarded as concrete realisations of spaces with generalized
holonomy groups advocated in, since they are not
Ricci flat and involve a form field.  An especially interesting
example is the  bundle over  or , which is
nine-dimensional. While nine-dimensional Ricci-flat manifolds do
not have an irreducible special holonomy group, our aforementioned
solutions are explicit examples of nine-dimensional spaces which
have generalized special holonomy.

      The embeddings of AdS spacetimes in M-theory and string theories
discussed in this paper all involve warp factors.  We expect that
there are many further examples of such solutions.  It is of interest
to explore them, both from the AdS/CFT perspective as well as for a
more concrete understanding and classification of spaces with
generalized special holonomy.
