In this note, we give a method to derive the Seiberg
duality by the matrix model. The key fact we used is that
the effective actions given by matrix model method should be
identical for both electric and magnetic theories. We demonstrate
our method for SQCD with ,  and  gauge groups. 
Matrix Model, Seiberg Duality 


Introduction and Motivation 

The field theory v.s.  matrix model conjecture proposed 
by Diikgraaf and Vafa
 has intrigued
a lot of works from various perspectives. The original idea comes from
the relationship between field theory and string theory, but later the
conjecture is proved by pure field theory methods in 
 for adjoint matter and
in for massive fundamental flavors and adjoint matter
(The generalization to massless flavors has been given inbased on the work of Seiberg). With these achievements,
matrix model becomes another alternative way to investigate many 
interesting problems in fields theories, like the new duality 
demonstrated in (the generalization to
other cases in)
and related works in.

Besides these successes of matrix model, we also like to know the limit
of the new method. The baryonic deformation has been addressed in
where it has been showed that although the baryonic deformation 
complexes the boundary condition in matrix model, there is a way to
sum up  relative contributions  for field theory in matrix model
 expansion. 
The multi-trace deformation was investigated in 
 where it was pointed
out that the direct matrix model 
integration of multi-trace deformation does not give back 
correct  results in field theory, but by linearization trick we
can reduce the multi-trace problem to the single-trace problem.
Except the adjoint and fundamental flavors, other matter contents
have been considered in where it was found that
the conjecture failed with these more general matter fields.
For example, the gauge theory  with antisymmetric chiral fields agrees 
with the matrix model up to  loops in the perturbative theory,
but discrepancy shows at  loops. We also like to ask what is
the correct matrix model description (if it exists) for chiral theories
because of their role in phenomenology.


The question we like to address in the note is the Seiberg duality
in matrix model. Seiberg duality of  theories 
  is
a very nontrivial statement above two different UV theories in IR.
It states that these two theories (the electric
theory and the magnetic theory) will flow to same (nontrivial) conformal
fixed point in IR. With the new method of matrix model, it is natural to
apply to the Seiberg duality. In,
explicit calculations in matrix models have been done for both 
electric and magnetic theories of SQCD with mass deformations of quarks
and it has been shown that the effective actions are same for
both theories, thus checked the Seiberg duality. Generalizations to
 groups are given in .


However, as we emphasized in, these calculations
serve as the check of Seiberg duality and we want to ask more
profound question: could we derive the Seiberg duality from the matrix
model? If we could, matrix model will be another powerful tool
to study the duality in field theory. 


Let us analyze this question. The first idea to derive Seiberg
duality in matrix model is to try to find a proper transformation
of matrix superpotential in one theory (for example the electric
theory). However, it seems this naive method does not work.
There are several reasons. First, familiar transformations
(like the Legendre transformation) change one theory into
another equivalent theory while the dual pair are total
different UV theories. This can be seen from another point
of view. The dual pair will contribute to same effective
action in IR, while  the effective action in IR is not directly
related to the free energy of matrix models, but through
W_eff = N_c F _S + F _
The relationship () shows that if , 
with general different  for dual pair we will have
, i.e., they are two different matrix
theories with total different free energies.


The second reason can be also seen  from  () that
the matrix model does not have any memory about the rank of
gauge group. We recover the information of rank only when
we go from the free energy to the effective action
where the rank  appears as a multiplier. It tells us
that we should not  seek the transformation of Seiberg duality 
in matrix model at the level of free energy (or the 
matrix model superpotential), but at the level of effective
action. 
More concretely, starting with  two matrix models with superpotential
 and , we do the independent matrix
model integrations and calculate  effective actions
 and . These effective actions will be
functions of  glueball field  and other fields as well as
 coupling constants. The idea is that if we 
require  
as  functions of all variables, we may derive the Seiberg duality.
We will show the idea works, at least for these examples we 
will discuss in this note. 



The Seiberg dual theory of  group 

The theory we want to discuss is the  gauge group with
 flavors (Various results in the SQCD like 
 theory with  gauge group in matrix model
can be found in.)  and arbitrary deformation
 of meson fields 
 where  is color
index. The matrix model integration of the prototype has been
given in by the insertion of delta-function
 
with results as
generic 
W_eff (S,M) & = & (N_c-N_f) S[1- S^3 ]-S ( (M) ^2N_f  )+V_tree (M)  
This is a pretty neat result because usually we can not do the matrix
model integration exactly(The matrix model integration 
of delta-function requires that the rank  of matrix is larger than
the number  of flavors. Since we have kept  fixed while
taking the large  limit in the matrix model integration, the
condition is satisfied.) . For this simple example with arbitrary
deformation of , () is exact. As a simple
exercise
we can take 
which has been done explicitly in . 
Equation () gives
W= (N_c-N_f) S[1- S^3 ]-S ( (M) ^2N_f  )+(m M)
Integrated out  by
WM =0= -S M^-1 +m
we get 
W= N_c S[1- S^3 ]-S ( ^N_f  (m)  )
which matches the result in.


Now we will apply above general result given by Demasure and Janik to
our Seiberg dual pair. Given the electric theory as above with
arbitrary deformation , we try to find the proper magnetic
theory  with  flavors ,
singlets  
and proper superpotential . The first step we need
to do is to integrate the magnetic matrix model.  Here we have
fields  and gauge singlets . Should we integrate
them all in matrix model? The answer is no. We need only integrate
fields   in matrix model while keeping  as
parameters. It is because fields  are gauge singlets. So 
according to the field theory analysis
in, we should
leave  untouched at the level of free energy and add them back to
the effective action directly by the prescription  (). 
This point has also  been  
emphasized in. Using this
new understanding, we redo the integration of magnetic matrix
model in at Appendix to show the
consistence.  


Since we do not need to integrate fields , the matrix model
integration of magnetic theory is same prototype as discussed by
 Demasure and Janik and we can write down the effective superpotential
directly as
W_g,eff (S,M,M )=(N _c-N_f) S [1- S 
 ^3 ]-S  ( (M )  ^2N_f  )
+V(M,M )
where to distinguish the magnetic theory from the electric theory, 
we use tilde for our
notations in 
magnetic theory and  is the magnetic meson given by
. To compare with the electric theory
() we need to integrate out the magnetic meson 
. 


Now it comes to the key point. Since we require
 for arbitrary  deformation , it is
conceivable that we should have 
where , which  describes the interaction of 
 and , does not depend on the deformation .
Because  is gauge singlet and adjoint under the flavor symmetry
, the interaction of  and 
 should be like 
. Integrating out the magnetic meson 
, we have equation
W_g M   =0 =
-S  M ^-1 +f(M,M )M  
From () we suppose to solve , put it
back to  and compare with  . Especially we should
have term  by putting   back to
term  . It is hard to imagine
we can have this result unless the solution is 
. In another word, 
 f(M,M )= (M  M^n ^2n-1  )
where  is a scale constant. Under this assumption, we have
M ^-1 = M^n S  ^2n-1  
Putting it back to  and simplifying, we get
W_g,eff =n S  (M)+N _c S 
-N _c S  S 
+ S   ^3N _c-N_f 
(^2n-1 )^N_f  
where we have neglected the term  in  (we will
neglect the same term in  ). The result should be
compared with the effective action of electric  theory
W_e,eff = -S (M)+ (N_c-N_f) S - (N_c-N_f) S S+ S ^3N_c-N_f 
which is just regrouped of equation (). Comparing the
first term of () and () we get the first
condition
-S= n S 
Using () to second and third terms we get
N _c= n (N_f-N_c)
From this we see that  must be positive integer. Comparing the
last term we get
^3N_c-N_f  ( ^3N _c-N_f )^1n 
=(-n)^-N _c n  (^2n-1 )^N_fn 
Now it is clear that when , equations (), ()
and () are exactly the dual relations of Seiberg dual pair.
Notice that just by requiring the matching of  and 
we can not exclude the possibility . However, from 
() we see that when , ,
so it is very natural to choose . In fact by the symmetry 
of dual pair and  the dual theory of the dual theory will go back to
original theory, we should choose . To see this, notice that



 


The Seiberg dual theory of  and  groups 
 
The checking of Seiberg duality in matrix model for  gauge group
with  flavors (Other works of  groups in matrix
model can be found also in.) 
 under the non-degenerated mass deformations
has been done in. The procedure to derive the 
Seiberg duality will be parallel to  case. Using the
delta-function technique, the general effective superpotential under
arbitrary meson deformation  with   is given by
W_e,eff =12  (N_c-2-N_f) S[1-S^3 ]
-S2  (M) ^2N_f   +V(M) 
To see this, choosing  and minimizing 
 in () regarding to  we get
W_e,eff  M = -S2  M^-1 + m2 =0
Putting it back to   and simplifying we get
W_e,eff =S2  (N_c-2) [1- S( ^3(N_c-2)-N_f 
(m)  )^1N_c-2  ]
which  is the result got in . Using similar arguments
( i.e., (1)  should not be integrated in matrix model; (2) 
the matching for arbitrary deformation  and the term 
) for
the magnetic theory we will have
W_g,eff =12  (N _c-2-N_f) S 
[1-S  ^3 ]
-S 2  (M )  ^2N_f   +V(M) +12 ^2n-1   (M^n M )
Integrating out meson field  we have
W_g,eff  M  =
S  2  M ^-1 +M^n 2 ^2n-1  =0
Solving  and putting it back we simplify the
effective action as (notice that we neglected the term )
W_g,eff =n S  2 (M) +S  2 
(N _c-2) (1-S )+S  2 
 ^3(N _c-2)-N_f  (^2n-1 )^N_f  
which should be compared with 
W_e,eff = -S2 (M)+S2 (N_c-N_f-2)(1-S)+S2 
^3(N_c-2)-N_f 
From the first three terms we get
-S=n S ,       N _c-2=n(N_f-(N_c-2) )
and from the last term we get
^3(N_c-2)-N_f  ( ^3(N _c-2)-N_f )^1n 
=(-n)^-N _c-2 n   (^2n-1 )^N_fn 
Similar reason as in  case tells us to choose . In this
case, equations () and () are exactly
the dual relations of Seiberg dual pair with  gauge group.
Notice that to compare  () with the result in field
theory, we need to set
^3(N_c-2)-N_f _matrix =16 ^3(N_c-2)-N_f _field 
as noticed in.


Comparing above calculation of  with the one of ,
we see they are same if we make the following replacement 
. When we discuss the gauge group  we
just need to use the replacement . With 
this replacement we will simply write down  results. Unlike the
 case where the meson fields  are symmetric,
for  (the rank  of  is ) the meson fields
 is antisymmetric where 
. The effective superpotential
under general meson deformation is
W_e,eff =12  (N_c+2-N_f) S[1-S^3 ]
-S2  (M) ^2N_f   +V(M) 

Similar reason constraints the effective superpotential for the
dual magnetic theory to be
W_g,eff =12  (N _c+2-N_f) S 
[1-S  ^3 ]
-S 2  (M )  ^2N_f   +V(M) +12 ^2n-1   (M^n M )
Integrated out  from () and
comparing with (),
we get following dual relations from matrix model
for  gauge group
-S=n S ,       N _c+2=n(N_f-(N_c+2) ) 

^3(N_c+2)-N_f  ( ^3(N _c+2)-N_f )^1n 
=(-n)^-N _c+2 n   (^2n-1 )^N_fn 
The requirement of two time dualities going back to original theory
picks up  solution. 


These examples we discussed in this paper are simple and standard. It will
be interesting to generalize above method to other dual theories found in
field theory, for example, the one discussed by Kutasov and Schwimmer
in. Unlike these did in this
paper for which general effective actions are known by matrix model,
we do not know  results for generalized Seiberg dual theories at this moment.
But if we manage to do it by matrix model, it should be possible to
derive the dual theory by the matrix model method.

Matrix integration in magnetic theory 
For the simplest magnetic theory with mass deformation
W_g= (mM)+1  q_i M^i_j q _j
the matrix integration has been done in,
where we integrated all fields  as
well as the gauge singlet fields . However, from the  field theory
analysis inas well as emphasized in ,
we should only integrate fields    in matrix model and
leave  terms which are gauge invariant to the effective superpotential.
This method has been used to generalize the work of Seiberg  
 with massive flavors 
to the case of massless flavors in  where as a by-product,
the original proposal of insertion of delta-function with fundamental
flavors has been explained (see alsofrom another point of view about the delta-function). With these new
understanding, we should redo the matrix model integration for above
magnetic superpotential (). It is similar to the 
example given in , but we include following calculations
for completeness which can also be considered as another example for
the justification of the delta-function.

Now let us do the calculation. The matrix model integration for
 can be found in where meson
fields  have been treated as  mass parameters. The
result is
W_g,eff = N _c ( ^3N _c-N_f 
(M ))^1N _c  + (m M)
where the first term comes after integrating out the glueball field 
 and the second term, from the original tree level
superpotential without matrix model integration. Next step is to minimize
meson fields . From () we have
W_g,eff  M =0=( ^3N _c-N_f 
(M ))^1N _c  M^-1 +m

which gives us
(M)^N _c-N_f N _c 
=(-)^N_f  ( ^3N _c-N_f  ^N_f  
)^N_fN _c  ((m))^-1  
Putting them back we get
W_g,eff & = & (N _c-N_f) ( ^3N _c-N_f  ^N_f  )^1N _c  
(M)^1 N _c  

& = & (N _c-N_f)  ( ^3N _c-N_f  
(-m) )^1N _c-N_f 
which is exactly the correct effective superpotential of magnetic theory.
