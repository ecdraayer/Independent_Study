We use Ward identities derived from the generalized Konishi anomaly in order 
to compute effective superpotentials for ,  and  
supersymmetric gauge theories coupled to matter in various representations. In
 particular we focus on cubic and quartic tree level superpotentials. With 
this technique higher order corrections to the perturbative part of the

Introduction 

The nonperturbative dynamics of supersymmetric gauge theories is a rich and 
fascinating subject. These theories exhibit various phenomena, such as gaugino
 condensation and confinement, a complete understanding of whose is still 
lacking. Recently a promising step toward this direction has been made by 
Dijkgraaf and Vafa ,,  who 
conjectured that the effective superpotentials for a wide class of 
theories can be computed by summing planar diagrams in a related matrix model. 
Arguments supporting this conjecture were given using chiral superspace 
techniques in  and using anomalies in . In particular 
this last result led the authors of  to further interesting 
developments ,,, . 
Many aspects of this conjecture have been widely studied in the 
last months .

In , a generalization of the Konishi anomaly ,
  has been considered, leading to a set of identities with the same structure of the loop equations of a matrix model. Using 
these identities the authors were able to derive the effective superpotentials
 of  up to an integration constant (basically the 
Veneziano-Yankielowicz superpotential ).  The aim of this work is 
to follow their approach to compute effective superpotentials in some specific 
cases 
for ,  and Here we use conventions such that  is an even number, i.e. the rank of the group is .  with matter in various representations.

Some superpotentials for  and  have already been computed in the
 framework of , , see for example For adjoint matter, the results
 obtained reflect the charge of the orientifold plane used in the geometric 
engineering of the gauge theory. For discussions on  see for example 
.

This paper is organized as follows: in the second section we review some results
 from  and in section 3 we compute the generalized Konishi anomaly 
for other groups, namely ,  and  and write down the equations (analog to the loop equations of the matrix model) we will use to compute effective superpotentials. In the 
fourth section we perform explicit computations of effective superpotentials 
for cubic and quartic interactions with matter in various representations. Finally in the last section we discuss our results and propose some further 
developments.

A Fairy Tale of an Anomaly 

In this section we will briefly summarize some results of . 

Let us begin with an  theory with matter  in the adjoint representation and a tree level superpotential
W()=_k=0 ^n g_kk+1 ^k+1  
as in . This theory has a natural ring structure, the chiral ring, defined by the equivalence classes of gauge invariant chiral operators modulo 
. It can be proven that it is generated by operators of the form ,
, and , where  is the gauge superfield. An important element of the chiral ring is the glueball
superfield , which is believed to describe the low energy dynamics of the theory.
 Given a tree level superpotential, the effective superpotential as a function of the glueball superfield  can be found, restricting ourselves to the chiral ring, by means of Ward identities following from a generalization of the Konishi anomaly.   

In  the most general variation of  in the chiral ring was considered
W_) 
where  is a general holomorphic function, leading to the generalized Konishi anomalyHere and in the following we will consider  as a matrix every time it appears inside a trace. 

D^2 J_f = f(,W_) W()  + 
 _ijkl  A_ij,kl  f(,W_)_ji  _kl   
whereWith  we mean the adjoint representation: 
 .  

and
A_ij,kl = 132^2  [W_,
 [W^, T_lk ]]_ij  
  being the generators of the gauge group ( in this case). Note that at this point this is quite general and a change in the gauge group will reflect only in the explicit form of the generators . For  we have
 and

D^2 J_f = f(,W_) W()  +
 132^2 
 _i,j  [W_, [W^, f_ij  ]
 ]_ji  .
 
Finally, taking the vacuum expectation value, we find

 f(,W_) W    =
 - 132^2 
 _i,j  ( [W_,[W^,
         f(,W_) _ij  
           ]])_ji   .
 
Now, we define
 T(z) &= _k0  z^-1-k  ^k = 1z-   
R(z) &= -132^2 W_W^ 1z-    
Taking

_ij  = f_ij (,W_ ) = R(z)_ij 
 
using the Konishi anomaly and the algebraic relation
 _i,j 
[_1,[_2, _ij  
 _1 _2z- ]]_ij  =
 (_1 _2z-  )^2
 
which holds if  and ,
 one can obtain

R^2(z) = W'(z) R(z) + 14 f(z) 



 
 being a polynomial of degree  in .
Solving this equation, we obtain

2 R(z) =  W'(z) - W'(z)^2 + f(z)  
Analogously, by taking

_ij  = f_ij () = T(z)_ij 
 
one finds
 2 R(z) T(z) = W'(z) T(z) + 14 c(z) 
where , like , is a polynomial of degree . This equation can 
be used together with  in order to derive a closed equation for 

T(z)=-14 c(z)W'(z)^2 + f(z)   
As explained in , expanding  in powers of  we can extract the vacuum expectation values of the operators  that can be integrated to obtain the effective superpotential up to a constant of integration independent of the couplings (but in general dependent on ), using the relation
W_eff  g_k =  ^k+1 k+1   
Then, the general strategy is to write  for the gauge group under
 consideration, obtain the generalization of  and , 
solve for  as in  and finally extract the superpotential 
(as explained before).

The information about the chosen vacuum is encoded in the explicit form of the 
 denominator of equation . In general, the choice of the function  in the curve

determines how the gauge group is broken and selects the vacuum. In particular, for the case of unbroken gauge group, only one of the  zeros of  
splits in a branch cut (around the vacuum), while the others will only get shifted. 
This means that the curve factorizes as 
 where
 the  unsplitted zeros of  are contained in the polynomial .




The Konishi anomaly for other groups  



In this section, we will derive the Konishi anomaly and the equation for  for  (in some detail) and  with matter in the adjoint and 
symmetric (antisymmetric for ), both traceful and traceless, 
representations and finally for  with matter in the adjoint representation.

Let us begin with the case of an  gauge theory with adjoint matter and 
evaluate explicitly . We take the generators of  to be 
 with 
. First of all, we note that the identity 
 holds due to the spinorial properties 
of  and is independent of the generators up to numerical factors.
 As can be easily 
checked the equation for   then becomes 

whose solution is
2 R(z) =  2W'(z) - 2 W'(z)^2 + f(z) 2   
Now let us focus on the equation for   and restrict 
ourselves to variations of the
 formProperly speaking one should add also the term  since  has to be an element of  in the adjoint representation, that is to say an antisymmetric matrix. However it can be checked that it  will contribute exactly as the previous, giving only an overall factor of . Because of this it will be omitted in the following analysis. 

= f()=-1 32 ^2  1 z-  
 
Then the equation for the anomaly gives

D^2 J_f = &-1 32 ^2  1 z-   W()  &+ 132^2  1 4 
 _ijkl  [W_,
 [W^,  (e_lk  - e_kl  ) ]
 ]_ij  ( 1 z-   
  (e_kl  - e_lk  ) 
1 z-   )_ji   
Let us focus on the second term on the right hand side
&1 32 ^2  1 4 
 _ijkl  [W_,
 [W^,  ( e_lk  - e_kl  ) ] 
]_ij  ( 1 z-   
  ( e_kl  - e_lk  ) 1 z-   
)_ji  = &1 32^2  1 4  
(4  W_W^z -   1 z -  
-8 ( W_W^1 z -   ( 1 z -   )^T )
-4  W_z -   W^z -   )
   
where we have used the commutation properties of the operators in the chiral 
ring. Now, being  an antisymmetric matrix, we have
( 1 z -   )^T = 1 z +    
Next we use the identity




in order to write




Taking expectation values of  and using the definitions 
we have



Using the relation  we finally obtain the equation for 
T(z)=-14 c(z)W'(z)^2 + f(z)  -2 z  
  W'(z)- W'(z)^2 + f(z)  W'(z)^2 + f(z)  
 
Here we absorbed a factor of  in a redefinition of  ( 
we will always use this convention when speaking about  and ). 
As previously explained, from  we can obtain the effective superpotential for an  gauge theory with adjoint matter and tree level superpotential .

Now let us consider the same gauge theory but with matter in the symmetric representation (that is,  is now a symmetric matrix and we use a symmetric representation for the  basis).
In this case  becomes



and
 W_W^1 z -   ( 1 z -   )^T 
&= W_W^( 1 z -   ) ^2 &= -  d dz  (
W_W^1 z -   )   
Again, from ,  and using now  one finds
W'(z)T(z)+1 4 c(z) =  R(z)T(z) - 2 R'(z)   
and the equation for  becomes
T(z)=-14 c(z)W'(z)^2 + f(z)   - 2   
d dz  ( W'(z)- W'(z)^2 + f(z)  ) W'(z)^2 + f(z)  
 
To complete our discussion about , let us consider now  in the 
traceless symmetric representation. All we have to do is to take the previous 
results and subtract the trace of . For instance,  will now become

= f()=-1 32 ^2  ( 1 z-   -
1 N  1 z-   )
 
This will not produce any change in  (since the trace part is proportional to the identity matrix and it is entering in the commutator); the only modifications will arise in the left hand side of  which now becomes



and in the equation for   which now readsRemember that we are taking vacuum expectation values; properly speaking  
has to be understood as . 
R^2(z) = (W'(z) - 1 N   W'() )
 R(z) + 14 f(z) 
Now equation  becomes




Finally we can write the equation for  for matter in the symmetric 
traceless representation
T(z) = &-14 c(z) ( W'(z)- 1 N   W'() )^2 + f(z)   &-2   
d dz  ( ( W'(z)- 1 N   W'() ) - 
 ( W'(z)- 1 N   W'() )^2 + f(z)  ) 
 ( W'(z)- 1 N   W'() )^2 + f(z)  
  


Now we will focus on an  gauge theory with matter in the adjoint 
(symmetric) and in the antisymmetric (both traceful and traceless) 
representations. With symmetric (antisymmetric) we 
mean that  has to be considered as a matrix  where  is a 
symmetric (antisymmetric) matrix and  is the invariant antisymmetric 
tensor of . We take the generators of  as 
 with . The 
analysis for the  case is almost identical to the one for the  
case, the only change being the sign in the generators (and of course the 
different properties of the matrices representing the field , since the 
antisymmetric invariant  will enter in the intermediate steps). Because of
 this we will only state our results.
For matter in the symmetric representation the equation for  becomes
T(z)=-14 c(z)W'(z)^2 + f(z)   + 2 z  
  W'(z)- W'(z)^2 + f(z)  W'(z)^2 + f(z)  
 
for matter in the antisymmetric traceful representation
T(z)=-14 c(z)W'(z)^2 + f(z)   + 2   
d dz  ( W'(z)- W'(z)^2 + f(z)  ) W'(z)^2 + f(z)  
 
and finally for matter in the antisymmetric traceless representation
T(z) = &-14 c(z) ( W'(z)- 1 N   W'() )^2 + f(z)   &+2   
d dz  ( ( W'(z)- 1 N   W'() ) - 
 ( W'(z)- 1 N   W'() )^2 + f(z)  ) 
 ( W'(z)- 1 N   W'() )^2 + f(z)  
  

As a last example, let us consider the  gauge group with matter in the adjoint representation. This is basically equivalent to consider an  
gauge theory subtracting the trace as in  (remember that the term 
containing the trace will not produce any modification when entering in a 
commutator). Then, one can easily find

T(z) = -14 c(z) ( W'(z)- 1 N   W'() 
)^2 + f(z)  
 





The effective superpotential 



In this section we apply the previous results in order to find the effective 
superpotential for ,  and  gauge theories with quartic 
and cubic superpotential and matter in various representations.

As already mentioned, the general strategy is to write down the equation for  for every particular case, expand it in powers of  and extract the vacuum expectation values of the operators , from where the effective superpotential can be obtained by using equation 
.

Quartic superpotential 

Sp(N)/SO(N) with matter in the antisymmetric/symmetric representation 



Let us suppose the following tree level superpotential:

 
W()=m 2  ^2+g 4  ^4
 

As seen in the previous section we obtain the following equation for 


T(z)=-1 4 c(z) W'(z)^2+f(z)    + 2 
W"(z)-(W'(z)^2+f(z) )' W'(z)^2+f(z)    
 
Where  for  and  and  are polynomials of degree 2
 and  

The denominator of both terms in equation  can be factorized as explained previously. We impose (see for example ):


W'(z)^2+f(z)=g^2 (z^2 - k^2)^2 (z^2 - 4^2) 
 
From this condition we arrive to the following expressions:


k& =  - m+2g ^2  g   & = -gm +  g^2 ( -3 f_2+m^2 )   6g^2  
  

Imposing condition  gives a system of equations for  and 
 with a set of solutions. Note that we choose the particular  and 
 tending to  and  for  going to zero 
(that is the classical limit). This means we place the branch cut around zero.
In order to have the correct asymptotic behavior of  for large   
(  , see eq. ) it 
can be shown thatThe difference with  is due to our 
redefinition of .   . Similarly the correct asymptotic 
behavior of  for large  (  )  sets 
.  and  can be 
found by asking the condition that  has no poles in  and  
(i.e. we choose our vacuum around  and the gauge group remains 
unbroken) or, equivalently:

 12i _C_k  dz T(z)=0 12i _C_-k   dz T(z)=0
  
For the present case we obtain:

 
c_0 &= 4 ( 2 ( m + gk ( 3k -2 k^2 
-4 ^2   ) ) +gk^2N ) 
c_1 &= 0
   
Next, we expand  in powers of  and obtain:


W_eff  m  = 2 g  ( m+3g 
^2 + (m+6g ^2 ) ( m+2g^2 )   ) 
 + ^2 N 
  
This expression can be expanded in powers of  and integrated in order to obtain the effective superpotential up to any given order; for instance up to 
fourth order, it reads
 
W_eff  =& 1 2   (- 2+N ) S  m +g 8m^2  ( - 10+3N ) S^2 -
 g^2 16m^4  ( - 38+ 9N ) S^3 
&+ g^3 96m^6  ( - 662+ 135 N )S^4 +   

Several comments are in order. Having obtained  integrating with respect to , the result is correct up to a function of  and  (a part of which is the Veneziano-Yankielowicz superpotential); we could have chosen 
the coefficient of the term  and integrated 
with respect to . As the perturbative part of the potential depends only on
 the ratio  by dimensional reasons , a function of 
only one of the coupling constants cannot contribute. For the same reason, from now on, we will only consider the  term.  

Sp(N)/SO(N) with matter in the adjoint representation 



This case is completely analogous to the case studied before.
 Now the equation for  reads:




Where again  and  are polynomials of degree 2. The denominator of 
both terms can be factorized as before (since it is the same) and we obtain 
the same values for the parameters  and . Again  
and  and the conditions  must be imposed. The values 
obtained for  and  are:

 
c_0 &= 4 ( 2 (gk^2+m) + g k^2 N ) c_1 &= 0
   
Again, expanding  in powers of  and and extracting the coefficient of  we obtain:

W_eff  m  = ^2 (N + 2 )
 
that can be expanded in powers of  and integrated with respect to , 
to give:

W_eff =(N+2 ) ( S 2   m + 3 g S^2 8 m^2  -9 g^2 S^3 16 m^4  +45 g^3 S^4 32 m^6   - 567 g^4 S^5  128 m^8   +  5103 g^5 S^6  320 m^10     + )
 

This result agrees with the one of , where the effective superpotentials
 were evaluated using both matrix model techinques and in terms of closed 
strings on Calabi-Yau geometry with fluxes. 

Cubic superpotential 

SO/Sp with traceful symmetric/antisymmetric matter 



Now the superpotential under consideration takes the form:
 
W()=m 2  ^2 + g 3  ^3
 
The equation for  reads exactly as in  but now  and 
 are polynomials of degree . Again we factorize the denominator of 
both terms, now as follows:


W'(z)^2+f(z) = g^2 (z-k)^2 (z+a+b) (z+a-b)
 
In this case, the parameters ,  and  are complicated functions of ,  and ; because of this we will only write their expansion in powers
of :

k & = - m g  + a a & = g m^2  S + 3 g^3 m^5  S^2 + 16 g^5 m^8  S^3 +
 105 g^7 m^11   S^4 + 768 g^9 m^14   S^5 + 6006 g^11  
m^17   S^6+ 49152 g^13  m^20   S^7 + b & = S 2m  ( 2 + 2 S g^2 m^3   + 9  S^2 g^4 
m^6 
 + 55  S^3 g^6 m^9  + 1547 4   S^4 g^8 m^12     
 + 11799 4   S^5 g^10  m^15   + 189805 8  
 S^6 g^12  m^18   + ) 
  

Note that in the classical limit (that is  ) the parameters  and  go to zero, while  tends to its classical value . 
Again the asymptotic behavior of  and  imposes  and , and, as before,  is set by the condition that  does not have a pole at :



12i _C_k  dz T(z)=0 
 
and from this



As before,  can be expanded in powers of  and we can integrate the coefficient of  with respect to  in order to obtain the effective superpotential.

 We stress that without too much difficult one can obtain the result up to the desired order. For instance, up to seventh order:


W_eff = &1 2   (-2+ N )Sm -
g^2 2m^3  (- 3+ N )S^2 -1 12  
g^4 m^6  (- 59+ 16N )S^3 &- 1 24  
g^6 m^9  (- 591+ 140N )S^4 - 1 16  
g^8 m^12   ( -4775 2 + 512N )S^5 
&- 1 80  g^10  m^15   ( - 80763+ 16016N 
) S^6  - 1 96  g^12  m^18   ( - 704809
+ 131072N ) S^7 +   
 
Note that our results are in perfect agreement, up to , with the ones of  found  using the matrix model perturbative approach of .


SO/Sp with traceless symmetric/antisymmetric matter 



In the case of matter in the traceless representation, the equation of  reads:
T(z) = &-14 c(z) ( W'(z)- 1 N   W'() )^2 + f(z)   & + 2 
d dz  ( ( W'(z)- 1 N   W'() ) - 
 ( W'(z)- 1 N   W'() )^2 + f(z)  ) 
 ( W'(z)- 1 N   W'() )^2 + f(z)  
  
Here, as we will see, the strategy we follow is different, due to the fact that we are considering the traceless representation and that  appears explicitly in the denominator of . First we factorize the denominator in the usual way:


(W'(z)-1 N W'())^2+f(z) = g^2 (z-k)^2 (z^2+a z + b)
 
As we are in the traceless representation we have:


&= 0 W'() &= g ^2
  

The polynomial  can be fixed as before, and again . The condition of  implies that the coefficient of  in the expansion of  must be zero. We can use this condition together with the conditions of factorization in order to obtain a system of equations from where  can be evaluated. Equivalently the traceless condition can be used to
determine  and equation  together with the conditions from 
factorization can be used to determine .
As before we obtain from this the effective superpotential. It should be stressed that such evaluation can be done at any desired number of loops, without many technical complications. For the effective superpotential one finds:

 
W_eff = & 
  (N - 2)S 2  m +
 g^2 (-N+4) S^2   2 N m^3  
 & + g^4 (160-24 N - N^2) S^3  12 m^6 N^2   
+ g^6 (3584 - 256N  -36 N^2 - N^3)S^4  
24 m^9 N^3   &+ g^8  ( 67584- 
704 N^2- 48 N^3 - N^4) S^5  32m^12  N^4  
 &+  7 g^10  ( 1171456 +  79872 N - 8320 N^2 - 1280 
N^3 -60 N^4 -N^5 ) S^6 240 m^15  N^5  +   
Note that these results agree with the ones of ; however using 
this method is easier to compute higher loop corrections.

  with adjoint matter 



Recently in  it was found that for a cubic potential, like , 
the perturbative part of the effective superpotential is zero up to terms 
of order , due to cancellations in the diagrammatic evaluation. In this 
paragraph we will show that the generalized Konishi anomaly implies that
the perturbative part of  is exactly vanishing to all orders.
Let us consider equation  and expand it in powers of 

T(z) & = -14 c_0 + c_1 z   ( W'(z)- 1 N   
W'() )^2 + f(z)   & =
-c_1 4g  1 z  + 1 4g  ( - c_0 + c_1 m g 
) 1 z^2   
+ O  ( 1 z^3  )   
& = N z  +  z^2   + 
O  ( 1 z^3  ) 
  

From the terms of order  we find the familiar condition 
. Considering the term  and imposing the 
tracelessness of  in  we obtain the relation 
.
Again the denominator of  can be factorized as in 
then the condition  gives the following relation

With this condition only odd powers of  will be present in the 
expansion of ; in particular

from which we see that the perturbative part of the effective superpotential 
is identically zero (remember that the perturbative part depends only on a 
specific ratio of  and , in this case ). 

We stress that the vanishing of the superpotential is a particular 
characteristic of the cubic superpotential. One can easily check that for a 
quartic tree level superpotential, a non zero result is obtained. 



Conclusions 



In this paper we used the generalized Konishi anomaly approach of  
in order to compute some effective superpotentials for the gauge groups ,  and  with quartic and cubic tree level superpotential and 
matter in various representations. Our results are summarized in the appendix.

Our results agree with previous literature, where superpotentials were computed
 summing planar diagrams in the matrix model context. The method used in this
paper does not rely on any diagrammatic expansion, but simply on Ward identities that allow us to write closed expressions for the generating functions of
correlators; because of this higher corrections are easily evaluated by
power expansions without having to draw any diagram. 

In particular, the cancellation of the perturbative part of  for  gauge group and cubic superpotential, that in  was checked diagrammatically up to fourth order in , can be easily shown to hold at any order.

In , it was found within the matrix model approach, for the  
gauge theory, a result disagreeing with previous gauge theory computations 
 at  loops,  being the dual Coxeter number. 
This led the authors of  to suggest that the general Dijkgraaf-Vafa 
 conjecture needs to be modified, at least in this particular case. 
In this 
paper we reproduced their matrix model prediction from the gauge theory side, 
within the formalism of . 
Then, unfortunatly, we are not able to give any hint on this intriguing 
problem. 

Possible further developments are to apply these techniques to more general superpotentials or other gauge groups (maybe exceptional); in some cases it may be even possible to find the exact  effective superpotential.
