With  the aim of exploring a massive model corresponding to the perturbation of the conformal model the nonlinear integral equation for a quantum system
consisting of left and right KdV equations coupled on the cylinder
is derived from an integrable lattice field theory. The eigenvalues
of the energy and of the transfer matrix (and of all the other local integrals of motion) are expressed in
terms of the corresponding solutions of the nonlinear integral
equation. The analytic and asymptotic behaviours of the transfer matrix are studied and given.

 Introduction 

The computation of the eigenvalues of the conserved charges - in particular the local ones - is a very
important issue in the study of  dimensional integrable
models. For instance, the local integrals of motion have recently revealed to enter the form of off-critical null-vectors. Among the various methods of computing, a possible one uses a
discretisation of the space and the diagonalisation of the discrete
transfer matrix by means of a Bethe Ansatz technique.
The problem of recovering the continuous limit of such eigenvalues can be
tackled using nonlinear integral equations, method previously applied to genuine lattice models like the XXZ chain and the inhomogeneous six-vertex model.

In a previous paper we coupled on the lattice the Lax
operators of two - left and right - quantum (m)KdV
equations, proposing two slightly different monodromy matrices as
possible descriptions of perturbed minimal conformal field theories. The Bethe
Ansatz diagonalization of the discrete transfer matrices was
completely achieved, showing that the problem is somehow equivalent to a
twisted spin  XXZ chain with alternating
dishomogeneities. The twist was called dynamical , because it is
automatically generated by the theory (and depends on the number of Bethe roots), not introduced as an external ad hoc
parameter. 
We concluded that this lattice model describes, in some sense, a dynamically twisted version of the lattice sine-Gordon theory and, in this respect, we conjectured and partially
argued that in the continuous limit it gives a description of perturbed minimal conformal models.   

In this letter we address the problem of performing the continuous
limit of the eigenvalues of the aforementioned transfer matrices, by
finding the nonlinear integral equation obeyed by the counting function. In particular, exact expressions of all the local integrals of motion are given as nonlinear functionals of the counting function. This
problem is different from that solved in, since these papers used a lattice approach to the twisted 
sine-Gordon model based on an inhomogeneous spin  chain (with a suitably added twist). However, this
lattice discretisation does not furnish a transfer matrix for the
sine-Gordon model, whereas our
construction is endowed with an
off-critical transfer matrix, which generates all the integrals of motion, in particular the local ones. On the other hand, our lattice model satisfies a braided version of the Yang-Baxter algebra.
    


 The nonlinear integral equation for the vacuum sector 

In this paper we continue the work done in, extending it to the massive case in an unifying view of conformal and off-critical theory. In fact, we start by recalling the introduction of the mass, realised through coupling two KdV theories via dishomogeneities. More precisely, we considered on a lattice of length
, spacing  and number of sites , , 
the following monodromy matrices 
M  ()&&e^-i^2 2  _i=1 ^N/4   L_4i (+)L_4i-1 (+)L_4i-2 (4i-3 (,  
 
M ^()&&e^i^2 2  _i=1 ^N/4   L_4i (-)L_4i-1 (L_4i-2 (+)L_4i-3 (+)  
  ,
with coupling constant  and dishomogeneity  
real. In these formulae left Lax operators  and right Lax operators
 are given by
 
where  are the discretised quantum counterparts of the mKdV
variables  (left case) and  (right case) and satisfy the
nonultralocal commutation relations
 
and the periodicity conditions
 
In fact, we have proved in that,
as a consequence of (, ), monodromy matrices (
) and () satisfy braided Yang-Baxter 
equations. Moreover, the diagonalisation of the corresponding 
transfer matrices is based on the Bethe equations 
 
in which 
is the number of Bethe roots and  is equal to
 for () and to  for (
). Correspondingly, the eigenvalues on Bethe states of the transfer matrices are
 _N()= ^+_N()+ ^-_N()  ,
 
where
 ^_N()=  
e^i^2 l  _r=1 ^l  (-_r i^2) (-_r)   _N^ ()
   
and
_N ^()= 
e^-N 2   [ 4 ( -
i^2 2  )
(+
i^2 2  ) ]^N/4  .
 
Comparison with equation (2.18) of shows that, after the
identifications , 
 and the substitution , Bethe equations () coincide with
the Bethe equations for the lattice sine-Gordon model  
twisted by the dynamical factor .
Now we want to summarise all the Bethe equations () into a single nonlinear integral equation. As a preliminary,
we define the function, analytic in the strip 
, 
 
which allows us to define the counting function 
 
In terms of the counting function the Bethe equations () assume the logarithmic form
 
Between the various solutions to the Bethe equations we single out the
vacuum, i.e. the eigenstate with the minimum energy, for which  are real and  are equal
to all the numbers of the form () between  and
. From () it follows that these two extremes are
Z_N()=N 4 (2^2)l(^2)+2^2 l  .The vacuum minimises the energy - which we will define in next section - when
1 3 <^2 <2 3   , and the "twist"  is small enough mod. .

Considering  in the region (), we now want to write an equation for the counting function associated to the vacuum in the continuous limit
N+ , R   fixed    . We firstly remark that () imply that in the continuous
limit also  and 
therefore, even if we define
^2 =p p^   , p<p^  coprimes   , 
the last term in () is
divergent. Therefore, we stick to the different subsequences
l=np^+, 0p^-1  , where  with  fixed.
Since we can discard in the definition of  multiples of , we get:
Z_N(x)=N 4 [(x +,  2 ^2 )+(x -,  2 ^2) ]+
_r=1 ^l (x -_r, ^2 )+2 , where  is finite in the continuous limit (the double braces denote the fractional part):
=   p p^    . Now, using standard techniques (see,), one can
rewrite a sum over the vacuum Bethe roots of a function  with no poles on a strip around 
the real axis as follows: We are fixing  to be even in
  the following (i.e. ), as the case  odd
  can be treated along the same lines and in the end does not add new information.  

_r=1 ^l f_N(_r)=-_- ^+ dx 2  f^_N(x)Z_N(x)+2_- ^+ dx 2 f^_N (x)Im  [1+e^iZ_N(x+i0) ]  . Applying () to the sum contained in () we get
 
Let us define for sake of conciseness
 
In these notations the Fourier transform of relation () is
Z_N(k)=N 4 (k) 1-K(k) -2K(k) 1-K(k) 
L_N(k)+4^2 
(k) 1-K(k)   , where we have adopted the following convention about the Fourier transform:
f(k)_- ^+ dx e^-ikx  f(x)  .
Explicitly, the Fourier transforms of the first two functions in () are respectively
K(k)=k( 2 -    ^2)  2 k   , (k)= 4 ik k( 2 - 2 ^2)  2 k  k . Reparametrising the coupling constant , introducing the kernel  and the renormalised twist , 
(1-^2)  , G(k) -  K(k) 1-K(k) =k( 2 -   ) 2 k  2  k(     2 - 2 )   ,  ^2  , equation () takes the compact form
Z_N(k)=N 4 (k) 1-K(k) +2G(k)L_N(k)+2 
(k)   . Now we want to Fourier anti-transform and then to perform the continuous
limit: therefore, it is necessary to work out in such a limit the behaviour of  
the anti-transform of the first term in the r.h.s.
F_N(x)&& _- ^+  dk 2  e^ikx 
(N 4 (k) 1-K(k) ) =


&=&N 4i _- ^+  dk 2k 
[ e^ik(x+) +e^ik(x-) ] k( 2 - 2 ^2) k  2 ^2 k( 2 - 2 ^2)   . This driving term  may be evaluated through the residue theorem and it diverges in the continuous limit, unless 
depends on  in a peculiar way. We sketch here the evaluation, since it differs from the previous ones (even from the conformal case). All the poles of the integrand lie on the
imaginary axis and, when , the poles with smallest modulus are .
If in the continuous limit
, we evaluate for fixed  the integral
in () containing  by choosing a semi-circle contour
in the upper -complex half-plane with a small
semicircle avoiding the pole at . Since the contributions from
the other poles are damped by an exponential of
, the leading term is given by the
residue at the pole with the smallest nonzero modulus, i.e. , minus the contribution of the semicircle around , whose value is linear in : . 
Analogously, in the evaluation of the integral containing 
we close the contour - containing a semicircle avoiding  - in the
lower -complex half-plane. Now, the
leading contribution is given by the pole at , minus the contribution of the semicircle around , whose value  
 cancels the previous one.
Adding the two residue contributions we obtain (up to terms  when ):
N+ , F_N(x)&=&-iN 2 e^-  (x+) 1 i^2 2(1-^2)  
+iN 2 e^  (x-) 1 i^2 2(1-^2)   +o(N^0) 

&=&Ne^-     x ^2 2(1-^2)  +o(N^0)=mR   x +o(N^0) ,
where we have supposed a logarithmic divergence of , via a constant mass parameter  (in such a way that  is dimensionless):
 
With this result in mind it is easy to write an equation satisfied by the counting function in the continuous limit, , from relation (): Z(x)=mR  x+
2_- ^+ dy  G(x - y)Im  [1+e^iZ(y+i0) ]+  .  
This nonlinear integral equation  describes
the -vacuum of the theory at the different values of .

Remark 1  Equation () has been found for 
 and small . However, it can be considered without problems in the whole
region  and , defining by analytical
continuation a state of the continuous theory which minimises energy.


Remark 2  Equation () with  would also describe the vacuum of the continuous theory from the lattice sine-Gordon model, with lagrangian
L =1 2 ()^2+m_0^2 8^2 8    , where  is a bare mass(From () we have the renormalised mass parameter  in the continuous limit.) . 
Hence, there is a sort of interchange, given by the first of (), between the coupling constant  in the lagrangian and  in the equation ().





 Finite size correction to the energy of the vacuum 
 
The continuous limit of a sum like () can be expressed, once () has been put in, in terms of only the counting function  (and the continuous limit of ):
_N+ N=R   _r=1 ^l f_N(_r)=f_b+_- ^+ dx  
J_f(x)Im  [1+e^iZ(x+i0) ]   . We have rearranged the r.h.s. in order to separate the bulk contribution 
f_b=_N+ [-_- ^+ dx 2  f^_N(x)
( mR    x
+) ] ,  from the finite size corrections depending on the linear functional
J_f(x)=_N+  _- ^+ dk 2 e^ikx  ik f_N(k) J(k)  , J(k)=k 2  2 k  2  k( 2 - 2 )   . Formula () allows to calculate exactly state depending quantities of a Quantum Field Theory on cylinder. 
In particular this formula applies effectively to the calculation of the energy of the -vacuum. We build up the hamiltonian operator in tight analogy with the same construction in lattice sine-Gordon model
 
where we have defined
  
Using (-) and
(, ), the eigenvalues of  for a general Bethe state read as a sum on Bethe roots
_r=1 ^l h(_r,N,R)  , 
where
h(x,N,R)=-1 4^2 2  [ -e^-x -i^2 2   (x++3i^2 2 )  + e^-x +i^2 2   (x ++i^2 2  )   &&

+e^3-x-5i^2 2   (x -+3i^2 2  )   
 -e^3-x -3i^2 2   (x -+i^2 2  )   
 -e^-x +i^2 2   (x +-3i^2 2  )  & &  

 +e^-x-i^2 2   (x +-i^2 2  )   
 +e^3-x +5i^2 2   (x --3i^2 2  )   
 -e^3-x +3i^2 2   (x --i^2 2  )  ]  .&& When , extending the results of
 to , we are able to show that the -vacuum is indeed the eigenstate with the lowest eigenvalue.
Moreover, when the twist  this is the energy of the lattice sine-Gordon model.

After Fourier transformingikh(k,N,R)&=&ie^2  2^2 k k 2 ^2 k 2  [ (k-^2) e^-k 2 +k^2 -

&-&  (k+^2) e^k 2 -k^2  ]  , we are left with the evaluation of  () in the continuous limit
J_h(x)&=&_N   Nie^2  2 R 2^2 
_- ^+  dk 2 e^ikx k   k 2  [ (k-^2)
e^-k 2 +k^2  - . 

&-&. (k+^2) e^k 2 -k^2  ]   . Again, because of relation ()
we can calculate exactly this limit by using the residue method (closing the contour of integration in the upper or in the lower -complex half-plane).
Collecting the finite contributions we obtain a simple behaviour
J_h(x)=- 4m[ 2  1-2^4 1-^2  ] ^2 2(1-^2)  (1-^2)^2 ^2    x 
 . Hence, the finite size correction 
to the energy of the -vacuum is 
E-E_b=-4m [ 2  1-2^4 1-^2  ] ^2 2(1-^2)  (1-^2)^2 ^2 
_- ^+ dx      x
 Im  [1+e^iZ(x+i0) ]  . As far as the -vacuum state is concerned, this formula has been derived within a twisted lattice sine-Gordon model and hence proves the quantum equivalence with the approaches to the sine-Gordon model based on spin  XXZ chain. However, a different renormalisation of the mass occurs in ().   
  
    

 The transfer matrix eigenvalues 

As the main aim of this section we shall compute the continuous limit of the
eigenvalues of the transfer matrix () proposed in as
description of perturbed conformal field theories. 

To make formula () useful, we shall define  
F ^+_N() ^+_N() ,F ^-_N() ^-_N()  . Let us firstly concentrate on :
&&F ^+_N()=_r=1 ^l [ (-_r +i^2) (-_r)   -i^2]+

&+&N 4 [ 2 ( --i^2 2  ) + 2 ( ++i^2 2  ) -2]   . Now we restrict ourselves to the -vacua, although generalisations to excited states can be worked out along the developments of.

The last addendum in () gives a contribution whose
continuous limit is zero if  and infinity if
. Therefore, we shall regularise  for
 defining it as the analytic continuation of  with . With this regularisation in mind we obtain from () 
F ^+()=F _b^+()+_- ^+ dx  
[_- ^+ dk 2 e^ikx  ik f^+(k,) J(k) ]Im  [1+e^i Z(x+i0) ] -i , where  is the bulk contribution,  is given by () and 
f^+(x,)=(-x+i^2 ) (-x)    . The twist  comes out as in.

Since  () has the periodicity property
F ^+(+i)=F ^+()  , it is sufficient to study  in the strip
. 
Comparing () with relation (5.6) of, we remark
that the second term in the r.h.s. is formally the
same. Therefore, we can use the results of that paper:
from formulae (5.16, 5.24) of we obtain that, if 
 
F ^+()=F _b^+()-_- ^+ dx  1   (x-) Im  [1+e^iZ(x+i0) ] -i ,
and that, if 
&&F ^+()=F _b^+()-i+
 

&+&_- ^+ dx   _- ^+ 
dk e^ik(x-i^2 2 )  ik  2  2k 2 k( 2 - 2 ) Im  [1+e^iZ(x+i0) ]  .
On the other hand, from definitions () and () it follows that
F _b^+()=_- ^+ dx 2 
i^2 (i 2 ) (i 2 +i^2) [mR   x
+] . This integral is finite only for . If  its value is
F ^+_b()=-mR  ctg    ^2 2 
  +i , whereas, if  it equals 
F _b^+()=-mR  1 ^2  2  
[   (+i 2 )] +i-i . 
Let us now consider  which reads from (-) and ()
&&F ^-_N()=_r=1 ^l [ (-_r -i^2) (-_r)   +i^2 ]+

&+&N 4 [ 2 ( -+i^2 2  ) + 2 ( +-i^2 2  ) -2]   . Again, in the continuous limit the last term is zero
in the interval  and we use our regularisation
procedure. According to the latter we obtain a relation
F ^-()=-F ^+(^2 )  , which gives  for any complex . From the
knowledge of  it is simple to reconstruct

 in all the
-complex plane. 



From the classical results we can argue that the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion of  are proportional to the local
integrals of motion in involution  of perturbed conformal field 
theories. Therefore, using
the same techniques as in, we expand 
 for 
in the strip  
(which is only a technical assumption):
&&  ()   =      -
mR ctg    ^2 2   

&&2  _n=0 ^+ e^    (2n+1) 
_- ^+  dx   e^  x(2n+1)  Im  [1+e^iZ(x+i0) ]  . Now, we need to compare this expression with the conformal analogous (5.48) of and to consider the conformal normalisation coefficients  ((5.50) of), to write down
  ()   =      -
mR  ctg    ^2 2   2  _n=0 ^+ e^    (2n+1) c_n+1  I _2n+1 ^   , where the local integrals of motion have the exact expressions
 I _2n+1 ^ =1 c_n+1    
_- ^+  dx   e^  x(2n+1)  Im  [1+e^iZ(x+i0) ]  . Moreover, we have been able to build up a lattice field theory for which conjecture (3.31) of - suggested by pure analogy with the conformal case - holds. Nevertheless, the naive scaling limit of our monodromy matrix is absolutely different from the proposed (but not actually used) prescription given in. On the other hand, we are in agreement with the finding of derived using a brilliant generalisation of the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz technique in the case of Lee-Yang model.

At the free fermion point () the local integrals of motion 
() are explicitly given by the integrals
I _2n+1 ^ =-2^1-n ^2n (n+1)(2n+1)_- ^+  dx 
e^2x(2n+1) Im   1+e^i[mR2(x+i0)+2]    . As far as we know, these expressions () have not obtained previously. For the time being, we cannot give more refined expressions, but we can conjecture that they may be connected to some special functions used in mathematical physics, since they enjoy a series expansion on residues. 



 Summary and outlook 

Starting from the lattice theory of two coupled (m)KdV equations, we 
have found in the whole interval
 the nonlinear integral equation which describes the
vacuum sector and we are in the position to work out all features of excited states after. The existence in our approach of a
transfer matrix (which generates the local integrals of motion in
involution) has allowed us to give expressions for its
eigenvalues on the twisted vacua in terms of the
solutions of the nonlinear integral equation and makes possible, in the next future, to find a deep link with the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz technique of. We have found strong evidence
that local charge eigenvalues coincide with the primary state eigenvalues of the
local integrals of motion of  perturbed minimal conformal models, the primary weight being linked to the twist. The expressions become explicit at the free fermion point ().
Eventually, we want to emphasise that the wide generality of our construction makes possible its application in the domain of two-dimensional supersymmetric field theories.
