Abstract 
 
We construct 7-dimensional compact Einstein 
spaces with conical singularities that preserve 1/8
of the supersymmetries of M-theory. Mathematically they have 
weak -holonomy. We show that for every non-compact 
-holonomy manifold which is asymptotic to a cone on 
a 6-manifold , there is a corresponding weak 
-manifold with two conical singularities which, close to 
the singularities, looks like a cone on . Our construction
provides explicit metrics on these weak -manifolds.
We completely determine the cohomology of these manifolds
in terms of the cohomology of .














Introduction 

When discussing compactifications of M-theory on a 
7-manifold  down to 4 dimensions one is mainly interested in
preserving exactly  supersymmetry. If the
4-form field  of 11-dimensional supergravity has a vanishing 
expectation value, it is well-known that the compactification 
manifold  must be Ricci-flat with
holonomy group  . This can however be 
generalized, similarly to the Freund-Rubin solution, to a non-vanishing 
background value with  being proportional to the 
4-dimensional -tensor. In this latter case the 
compactification manifold must have so-called weak 
-holonomy if we want to preserve exactly  supersymmetry.
Weak -holonomy manifolds are Einstein spaces with positive 
curvature, in agreement with the fact that the non-vanishing
4-form field induces a non-vanishing energy-momentum tensor.

M-theory on -holonomy manifolds has been much discussed 
recently and many such manifolds are known with more or less 
explicit metrics. Complete non-compact metrics were first 
given in, and compact spaces, though no 
explicit metrics, were first constructed in,
see also.

M-theory/supergravity compactified on smooth -holonomy 
manifolds only has abelian gauge groups and no charged chiral fermions, 
and hence is rather uninteresting. Introducing -orbifold 
singularities, however, leads to non-abelian gauge groups, 
the symmetry enhancement being provided by M2-branes that 
wrap the vanishing two-cycles.
The presence of conical singularities was shown to lead 
to charged chiral fermions, and hence the theory could be
potentially anomalous. The issue of anomaly 
cancellation is discussed in
. The drawback of these discussions is 
that no explicit examples of compact  -holonomy
manifolds with conical singularities are known. Instead one 
considers the non-compact manifolds of 
which in a limit become  cones on some 6-manifold . 
One then assumes  that compact -holonomy manifolds 
also can develop conical singularities and, close enough to 
the singularities, look like one of these cones. While 
these discussions are very elegant, it still would be nice 
to have  some explicit examples of 
compact manifolds with conical singularities at our disposal.

Since the basic examples of conical singularities are 
limits of the non-compact manifolds of one could 
try to start with these manifolds and somehow make them compact.
This can indeed been done, as we will show in this paper,
 at the price of introducing positive 
curvature, deforming the -holonomy to weak -holonomy.

Our strategy to construct the compact
weak -holonomy manifolds
is the following: we begin with any non-compact 
-holonomy 
manifold  that asymptotically, for "large " becomes a 
cone on some 6-manifold . The -holonomy of  
implies certain properties of the 6-manifold  which 
we deduce. In fact,  can be any Einstein space 
of positive curvature with weak -holonomy. 
Then we use this  to construct a compact 
weak -holonomy manifold  with two 
conical singularities 
that, close to the singularities, looks like a cone on .

We go on to study in detail the cohomology of these
manifolds. Since, up to scale,  is completely 
determined in terms of  it is not surprising that 
the cohomology of  is determined by that of .
Due to the singularities, however, one has to specify
which class of forms one is going to allow on .
Physically it is clear that one is interested in 
square-integrable forms. We prove that all 
-harmonic 
-forms on  for  are given by the 
trivial extensions of the harmonic -forms on .
In particular,  and  ,
while .
For  the  -harmonic 
-forms on  are just the Hodge duals of the 
previous ones. We also give a simple generalisation 
of these cohomological results to analogous constructions 
in arbitrary dimensions of spaces with two conical 
singularities.

Our construction provides examples, 
with explicitly known metrics and cohomology, of compact 
manifolds
with conical singularities that are Einstein spaces and 
preserve  of the supersymmetries of M-theory. 
One could go on and further quotient  by 
some  to 
obtain -orbifold singularities. Almost the whole 
discussion of about non-abelian 
gauge groups, chiral fermions
and anomalies could then be 
repeated in this setting, but now with the advantage 
of having well-defined explicit examples at hand.

This paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 is a brief review of - and weak -holonomy.
In section 3 we explicitly carry out the construction of 
the weak -holonomy manifolds, and in section 4 we 
discuss the cohomology of these manifolds in detail and prove
the above-mentioned results. In section 5, we draw
some conclusions and discuss further developments. The
appendix contains some technical material which is
needed in the main text.

A brief review of weak -holonomy 


Compactifications of M-theory on 7-manifolds  of 
-holonomy preserve  of the 
32 supersymmetries if
the expectation value of the four-form  vanishes. It is 
known, however, that one can have non-vanishing -flux on the 
four-dimensional space-time  and still preserve the 
same amount of supersymmetry if the 7-manifold  has 
weak  -holonomy and  is . There are
several equivalent ways to characterise these manifolds. 
For -holonomy we have (exactly) one covariantly constant 
spinor 
f1 
( _j+14  _j^ab  ^ab ) =0  ,
from which one can construct (see appendix ) 
a closed and co-closed three-form 
:
f2 
,  .
This implies that  is Ricci flat. For weak  we have 
instead
f3 
( _j+14  _j^ab  ^ab ) 
= i 2  _j  ,
which implies the existence of a three-form  obeying
f4 
_l= 4   _l ,
as well as  being Einstein:
f5 
_ij =6^2 g_ij   .
It can be shown that the converse statements are also true, 
namely that eq. () implies  (), and 
eq. () implies  (). Note that for 
, at least formally, weak  goes over to 
-holonomy.

Physically, a non-vanishing Ricci tensor is due to a 
non-vanishing energy-momentum tensor . Indeed, 
eq. () precisely is the condition (see e.g. 
(
In  was normalised differently: 
.) )
for preserving  supersymmetry in four dimensions 
if the four-form  has a background value
f6 
G=-6  vol _4
where  is the volume form on , i.e. 
 and all other 
components vanish. This induces a non-vanishing 
energy-momentum tensor,  and . 

Einstein's equations are
f7 
_MN -12  g_MN  = 196  
( 8 G_MPQR G_N^  PQR  - g_MN  G_PQRS G^PQRS )


and, for the background (), they imply
f8 
_ = -12^2 g_ , 
_ij  = 6 ^2 g_ij   .
This is consistent with eq. () and the fact that 
 is .

Construction of weak -holonomy manifolds with 
singularities 

One method to construct  -holonomy or weak -holonomy
metrics is based on a certain 
self-duality condition for the spin connection, as explained 
in. This condition can be written as
f9 
_abc  ^bc  =-2l e^a
where  is the 7-bein on  and the  are 
the structure constants of the imaginary octonions.(
Note that  are "flat" indices with euclidean signature,
and upper and lower indices are equivalent.
) 
The latter are completely antisymmetric and equal 
 or 0. An explicit choice is

. Self-dual and anti self-dual
projections are explained in appendix . It was 
shown in that -holonomy/weak -holonomy 
is equivalent to the existence of a local  frame 
where the corresponding  satisfy eq. ().
We will call such a frame a self-dual frame. Most examples of 
 metrics () known in the 
literature actually are written in a self-dual frame. 
Examples of weak -metrics 
naturally written with self-dual frames
are those with principal orbits being the Aloff-Walach 
spaces  as given in,
as well as the one described in. These examples 
are smooth manifolds. They can be obtained by starting 
with an 8-dimensional manifold of -holonomy 
that is a cone over a 7-manifold . An analogous 
self-duality condition for the 8-manifold then reduces 
to the self-duality condition () of  with 
 which has weak -holonomy. In this 
construction the original  metric is a 
cohomogeneity-one metric so that the resulting 
metric on  is cohomogeneity-zero.

A basic role in establishing - or weak -holonomy 
is played by the above-mentioned 3-form . Hence, 
it is worthwile to note the following result.
The 3-form  of eq. () or  of
() is given by
f9a 
16  _abc  e^ae^be^c

if and only if the 7-beins  are a self-dual frame. 
This holds for  () and  (weak ). 
The proof is simple and is given in appendix .
Later, for weak ,
we will consider a frame which is not self-dual 
and thus the 3-form  will be slightly more 
complicated than ().

Our goal is to construct compact weak -holonomy manifolds 
with conical singularities.  Some specific examples of such
manifolds were constructed in.
Here we want to extend this construction. We will show that, 
for every non-compact -manifold that is asymptotic 
to a cone on , one can construct a corresponding compact 
weak -manifold with conical singularities, that close 
to each of the singularities becomes a cone on .

We start with any -manifold  which asymptotically 
is a cone on a compact 6-manifold :
f10 
s_X^2 r^2 +r^2 s_Y^2  .
Since  is Ricci flat,  must be an Einstein manifold with 
. In practice, 

or , with explicitly known metrics.  
On  we introduce 6-beins
f11 
s_Y^2 = _^^ ,
and similarly on 
f12 
s_X^2 = _a=1 ^7 e^a e^a  .
Our conventions are that  
run from 1 to 7 and  from 1 to 6. 
The various manifolds and corresponding viel-beins 
are summarized in the table below.
Since  has -holonomy we may assume that the 7-beins
 are chosen such that the  are self-dual, 
and hence we know from the above remark that the closed 
and co-closed 3-form  is simply given by
eq. (), i.e.
.
Although there is such a self-dual choice, in general,
we are not guaranteed
that this choice is compatible with the natural choice of 
7-beins on  consistent with a cohomogeneity-one metric 
as (). (For any of the three examples cited above, 
the self-dual choice actually
is compatible with a cohomogeneity-one metric.)

Now we take the limit  in which the 
-manifold becomes
exactly a cone on  so that  with
f14 
^= r ^, ^7 = r  .
In this limit the cohomogeneity-one metric can be shown to be 
compatible with the self-dual choice of frame 
(see appendix ) 
so that we may assume that () is such a self-dual 
frame. More precisely, we may assume that the original frame 
 on  was chosen in such a way that after taking 
the conical limit the  are a self-dual frame. 
Then we know that the 3-form   of  becomes a 
3-form  of  given by the limit of (), namely
f15 
r + r^3 with the 2- and 3-forms on  defined by
f16 
&=&12  _7  ^^


&=&16  _   ^^^ .
The dual 4-form is given by
f17 
- r^3 r where  is the dual of  in  (see appendix 
 for an explanation of the powers 
of  and the sign). As for the original , after taking
the conical limit, we still have  and .
This is equivalent to
f18 
&=& 3

&=& - 4 .
These are properties of appropriate forms on , and 
they can be checked to be true for any of the three standard 's.
Actually, these relations show that  has weak -holonomy.
Conversely, if  is a 6-dimensional manifold with weak 
-holonomy, then we know that these forms exist.
This is analogous to the existence of the 3-form 
 with  for weak -holonomy.
These issues were discussed e.g. in.
Combining the two relations (), 
we see that on  there exists a 2-form  obeying
f19 
+ 12 ,  .
This equation can equivalently be written as 
 where 
 is the 
Laplace operator on forms on .
Note that with  we actually have 
 and  is 
cohomologically trivial. This was not the case for 
the original .

We now construct a manifold  with a 3-form 
that is a deformation  of this 3-form   and
that will satisfy the condition () for weak 
-holonomy. This general construction is inspired 
by the examples of. Since weak 
-manifolds are Einstein manifolds we need to introduce 
some scale  and make the following ansatz for the metric
on 
f20 
s_X_l^2 = r^2 +r_0^2 ^2  s_Y^2  ,
with 
f21 
= rr_0  , 0r r_0  .
Clearly, this metric has two conical singularities, one at 
and the other at . Actually, it is not difficult to
prove the following result: let  be an Einstein space 
with  and let
f22 
s_X_l^2 = r^2 + h^2(r) s_Y^2  .
Then  is an Einstein space with 
iff
f23 
h^2(r)= r_0^2 ^2(rr_0 ) 
with  ^2=r_0^-2 
(up to a possible shift of ). This remains true in the limit
 with  and  where one gets 
back the cone.

We see from () that we can choose 7-beins  on 
 that are 
expressed in terms of the 6-beins  of  as
f24 
e^ ^, e^7=r  .
Although this is the natural choice, it should be noted
that  it is  not  the one that leads 
to a self-dual spin connection
 that satisfies eq. (). We know from 
 that such a self-dual choice of 7-beins must 
exist if the metric
() has weak -holonomy  
but, as noted earlier, there is no reason why this choice 
should be compatible 
with cohomogeneity-one, i.e choosing . 
Actually, it is easy to see that for weak -holonomy, 
, a cohomogeneity-one choice of frame
and self-duality are incompatibel:
a cohomogeneity-one choice of frame means  
and  so that 

 and . 
But then the self-duality condition for  reads 

. Since  
is the spin connection on , associated with , 
it contains no -piece, and the self-duality 
condition cannot hold unless . Indeed, 
the examples of self-dual  for weak  mentioned 
above were all for cohomogeneity-zero. 

Having defined the 7-beins on  in terms of the 6-beins 
on , the Hodge duals on  and on  are 
related accordingly. As shown in appendix ,
if  is a -form on , we have 
f27 
( r _p) 
&=& ( r_0 )^6-2p 
_p 

_p &=& (-)^p ( r_0 )^6-2p 
r _p  ,
where we denote both the form on  and its trivial
(-independent)
extension onto  by the same symbol .

Finally, we are ready to determine the 3-form 
satisfying . Inspired by the 
examples considered in, we make the ansatz
f28 
_(r_0)^2  r+ (r_0)^3 (  +  )
 .
Here, the 2-form   and the 3-forms  and 
are forms on  which are trivially extended to forms on 
 (no -dependence). 
Note that this  is not of the form () 
as the last term is not just  but 
. 
This was to be expected since the cohomogeneity-one frame 
cannot be self-dual.
The Hodge dual of  then is  given by
f29 
_(r_0)^4 - (r_0)^3  r ( + )
while
f30 
_&=& (r_0)^2 r(-+ 3 )
+ (r_0)^3 
(  +  )


&+&4r_0  (r_0)^3 r 
(  -  )  .
In the last term, the derivative  has exchanged 
 and  and this is the reason why both of 
them had to be present in the first place.

Requiring  leads to the following 
conditions
f31 
&=& 3

&=& 4lr_0 

&=& -lr_0 

&=& lr_0  .
Equations () and () require
f35  
r_0=1l
and 
(since for a 3-form ). Then () is
, and inserting  and 
eq. () we get
f36 
+ 12 =0  .
But we know from () that there is such a two-form 
 on . Then pick such a  and let 
 and 
. We 
conclude that
f37 
_l=(lrl)^2  r+13  (lrl)^3
(r  - r  )
satisfies  and that the 
manifold with metric () has weak -holonomy. 
Thus we have succeeded to construct, for every non-compact 
-manifold that is asymptotically (for large ) a 
cone on , a corresponding compact weak -manifold 
with two conical singularities that look, for small , 
like cones on the same . Of course, one could start 
directly with any 6-manifold  of weak -holonomy.

The quantity  sets the scale of the weak -manifold 
 which has a size of order . As , 
 blows up and, within any fixed finite distance from 
, it looks like the cone on  we started with.

Cohomology of the weak -manifolds 

We now want to investigate the cohomology of the weak 
-manifolds  we have constructed. We will 
show that it is entirely determined 
by the cohomology of . 
As before, we always assume that  is a non-singular 
compact Einstein space with positive curvature.
This implies (see e.g. p. 63 of) 
that there are no harmonic 
1-forms on  and .



Essentially, we will show that, 
on , harmonic -forms with  are given by 
those on , while harmonic -forms with  are 
given by their Hodge duals on . In particular, this means that
there are no harmonic 1- or 6-forms on .
 
There are various ways to define harmonic forms which 
are all equivalent on a compact manifold without singularities 
where one can freely integrate by parts. Since  has 
singularities we must be more precise about the definition
we adopt and about the required behaviour of the forms as the 
singularities are approached. 

Physically, when one does a Kaluza-Klein reduction of an 
eleven-dimensional -form  one first writes a double
expansion

where  are -form fields 
in four dimensions  and the  constitute, for each ,
a basis of -form fields on . It is convenient to 
expand with respect to a basis of eigenforms of the 
Laplace-operator on . Indeed, the standard kinetic term
for  becomes
c1 
_M _4X_l C_k C_k
&=&_p,i (
 _M _4  A^i_k-p A^i_k-p   
_X_l _p^i _p^i 


&+& _M _4   A^i_k-p A^i_k-p   
_X_l _p^i _p^i )  .
Then a massless field  in four dimensions arises for
every closed -form  on  for which
 is finite.
Moreover, the usual gauge condition   leads to
the analogous four-dimensional condition
 provided we also have . 
We are led to the following definition:


Definition : 
An -harmonic -form  on  is a -form 
such that
c2 
(i) & & _p ^2 _X_l _p _p <  , and 


(ii) & &_p =0 and  _p=0  .
Note that this definition is manifestly invariant under Hodge duality.
We will prove the following proposition.

Proposition :  Let  be a 7-dimensional manifold 
with metric given by (), (), i.e.
c3a 
s_X_l^2 = r^2 +r_0^2 ^2  s_Y^2  ,where   
= rr_0   , 0r r_0  .
Then all 
 -harmonic -forms  on  for  
are given by the trivial (-independent) extensions to  of the 
-harmonic -forms  on . For  all
-harmonic -forms on  are given by .

Since there are no harmonic 1-forms on  we immediately have the

Corollary :  The Betti numbers on  are given by those 
of  as
c3b 
b^0(X_)=b^7(X_)=1&,& b^1(X_)=b^6(X_)=0 , 


b^2(X_)=b^5(X_)=b^2(Y)&,& b^3(X_)=b^4(X_)=b^3(Y)  .
Before embarking on the rather lengthy proof, let us make 
some remarks. If we do not require square-integrability 
on , it is obvious that harmonic -forms on 
 () carry over to harmonic -forms 
on  as . Their Hodge duals on  
then give another set of harmonic -forms on  
(). The Betti numbers then would be 
related as  in agreement 
with the Kunneth formula. What changes this result is 
the requirement of square-integrability which eliminates 
the harmonic -forms on  for 
in the first set, and those with  in the second set.

Another subtle point is the following. 
We also have to show that on  there are no other 
-harmonic forms than those that come from the harmonic 
forms on . This would follow easily from standard arguments
if we could freely integrate by parts with respect to 
. However, due
to the singularities at  and  this is not 
allowed. Instead we have to carefully solve the
"radial" differential equation and show that there
are no "square-integrable" solutions.
Fortunately, the differential equation can be reduced 
to the hypergeometric equation where 
we have explicit formulae for the 
asymptotic behaviour of the solutions at our disposal.

Finally, we remark that it is straightforward to generalise
the proposition to  (- and -dimensional manifolds 
 and 
and/or to more general metrics where  
is replaced by a
different function  with the same linear asymptotics, so 
that one still has conical singularities. We will give 
the precise statement as a corollary, after having completed 
the proof.



Preliminaries :  
We begin by considering forms on . For some fixed ,
let  (resp. ) be a basis of -forms 
(resp. -forms) on . Since we will only be interested 
in square-integrable forms on , without loss of 
generality,
we will only consider forms on  that are square-integrable 
on  with  respect to the standard inner product for -forms
( or )
d1 
(^k_q  ,  ^l_q)=_Y ^k_q ^l_q  .
We will assume that the basis is chosen to be
orthonormal with respect to this inner product, which will
simplify the discussion below. Furthermore, we will encounter 
. Since we can freely 
integrate by parts on the smooth compact manifold  
and as , we have
d2 
(_p-1 ^i , _p-1 ^j)
=(_p-1 ^i , -_p-1 ^j)  .
Thus  is a symmetric differential operator on 
forms on  and we may as well assume that the basis of 
 has been chosen as a basis of orthonormal 
eigen-forms of this operator:
d3 
- _p-1 ^i = _i _p-1 ^i  ,_i0  ,
so that by () we have 
.

Proof : 
To prove the proposition, we consider the most general 
-form  on :
d4 
_p=rG_i(r) ^i_p-1  
+  g_k(r) ^k_p 
where sums over repeated indices  or  are understood. 
We want to see which restrictions are imposed on the 
functions  and  by equations () 
and () defining an -harmonic -form on .

First,  implies
d5 
G_i(r) ^i_p-1  = g'_k(r) ^k_p 
and g_k(r) ^k_p  =0  .
We define  
for some . Integrating the first relation
() gives
d6 
g_k(r) _p^k = F_i(r)  ^i_p-1  + _p  ,
where , and by the second equation ()
we have . Hence,  is closed on  and we can write
,
where  is a harmonic -form on . Finally, if we 
let , we see from equations
() and () that
d8 
_p&=&_p^(0)  + ( F_i(r) ^i_p-1 ) 


&=&_p^(0)  + F_i(r) _p-1 ^i 
+ F_i'(r) r_p-1 ^i  ,
with  harmonic on . Note that, in general,
 is not square-integrabel so that 
 is not -exact.

The Hodge dual of such a  on  is 
(recall eq. ())
d9 
_p=
(-)^p (r_0)^6-2p  r( _p^(0)  + F_i(r) _p-1 ^i ) 
+ (r_0)^8-2p  F_i'(r) _p-1 ^i  .
Then  implies
d10 
( (r_0)^8-2p  F_i'(r))' _p-1 ^i 
&=& (-)^p (r_0)^6-2p   F_i(r) _p-1 ^i 


(r_0)^8-2p  F_i'(r) _p-1 ^i&=& 0  .
At this point it is useful that we have chosen the 
as a basis of eigen-forms of the differential operator
 with eigenvalue  so that eq. ()
becomes
d12 
( (r_0)^8-2p  F_i'(r))' =
_i (r_0)^6-2p   F_i(r) (no sum over   i)  .
Then every solution to eqs () and () 
which leads to a square-integrable  yields an 
-harmonic -form on . From eqs ()
and () we get
d13 
_p^2&=&
_0 ^r_0   (r_0)^6-2p  r 
_Y _p^(0)  _p^(0) 

 
&+& _i_0 ^r_0  
[  (r_0)^6-2p  (F_i(r))^2 _i
+ (r_0)^8-2p  (F_i'(r))^2 ] r    ,
where we used eqs (), () and the othonormality 
of the . The cross-terms, linear in  
dropped out, upon integrating by parts on .
Since  () is a sum of non-negative terms, finiteness of
 implies finiteness of each of them separately.

In the sum over  we will distinguish the indices 
 that we will take to correspond to 
, from those  with . Since  
means , eq. () can be rewritten as
d14 
_p&=&_p^(0)  + _i=1 ^i_0  F_i'(r)  r_p-1 ^i
+ _i>i_0  ( F_i'(r)  r_p-1 ^i  
+ F_i(r)  _p-1 ^i ) 

 
&& _p^(1)  + _p^(2)  + _p^(3)   .
We will show below that if  (with  
solutions of () with ) then 
 diverges. Anticipating this result, we must take 
. Then only  with 
appear in eq. (). They are solutions of eq.
() with  so that
d16 
(r_0)^8-2p  F_i'(r) = c_i  , i=1, i_0 ,
and from eq. ()
d17 
_p-1 ^(0)  = 0 with 
_p-1 ^(0)  = _i=1 ^i_0  c_i _p-1 ^i  .
Note that this implies that  is harmonic on 
and . Then
d18 
_p^2=
_0 ^r_0  r   [ (r_0)^6-2p 
_Y _p^(0)  _p^(0) 
+ (r_0)^2p-8  _i=1 ^i_0  c_i^2 ]   .
This converges for  if and only if , i.e. 
, and for  if and only if 
.(
Note that for , 


is  square-integrabel, but
 is not, 
confirming the remark below eq. ().

) 
Hence,  is -harmonic if and only if
d19 
_p&=&_p^(0)  for   p3  ,


_p&=&(_p-1 ^(0) )     for   p4  .
Since  is a harmonic -form on 
, the -harmonic  for  are exactly the 
Hodge duals of the -harmonic  with .

Finally, we show that in the decomposition ()
of an -harmonic -form  the third part 
 must vanish. For this it is enough to show that 
 by itself cannot be . In order to do so, 
we assume  for one or more  (with ). 
For these , equations () and () must 
hold. While eq. () involves a sum over all , 
eq. () holds for every  separately. We want to 
show that there are no (non-vanishing) solutions of 
() that lead to a finite norm
(
The usual argument for this type of problem goes like this:
Assume  satisfies eq. () with .
From the asymptotics of the differential equation one 
immediately deduces that the general solution behaves as
  as  with 
 where 
, and similarly 

  
as . We may choose the coefficients  and 
 but then  and  are determined through the actual solution of the full differential equation. 
Square-integrability 
(in the sense of eq. ())
requires  and . We may freely choose 
, and then determine . If  
then there is no square-integrabel solution. The argument
we present in the text is somewhat different, although 
perfectly equivalent.
)   
of .

To proceed, we now reduce eq. () to the 
well-known hypergeometric equation. The required change 
of variables is two-to-one, so first we have to 
reformulate the problem on half the interval, i.e. on 
.
Since eq. () is a second-order differential 
equation there 
are two linearly independent solutions. Given the symmetry 
 that maps , one solution can 
be chosen 
-even and the other -odd. The
general solution  then is 
.
When computing  no cross-terms
 or 
 survive and
it is enough to show that neither 
nor   leads to a finite norm. With either choice,
 or ,
the integrand in () is -even and can
be rewritten as twice the integral over half the interval:
d20 
_p^2_F_i- contribution   =
2 _0 ^r_0/2  r   [ (r_0)^6-2p 
(F_i(r))^2 _i
+ (r_0)^8-2p (F_i'(r))^2 ]   ,
and it is enough to know the solution  for 
. 
Note that eq. () only holds if  is the even 
or the odd solution, but not for an arbitrary linear 
combination thereof.
If  is -even
then  and if  is -odd
then  . Hence we can solve the differential 
equation () on the smaller interval  
and select the even or odd  through the appropriate 
boundary condition at .

Now we make the change of variables
c27 
x=()^-2  , F_i(r)=f(x)  .
This is one-to-one on the smaller interval :
as  goes from  to , our new variable  
goes from  to 1.
One has  and
eq.  () becomes
c28 
4x (x-1) f"(x) + 2( (5-2p)(1-x) +1 ) f'(x) 
- _i f(x) = 0  ,
which is the standard hypergeometric equation. 
The vanishing of  translates
into , and the vanishing of  into
the vanishing of  at . 
Thus we have to find the solutions of the hypergeometric equation
satisfying one or the other of the following boundary conditions: 
c29 
as  x1  : 
f(x) 0 or  x-1  _x f(x) 0   ,
and show that both solutions lead to an infinite norm of 
.
The contribution of a given solution  to  is
c30 
_p^(3) ^2_F_i- contribution   = r_0^7-2p 
_1 ^  [  f^2(x) _i + 4 x (x-1) (f'(x))^2 ]
x^p-4 x-1   x .
We can integrate the second term by parts and use the differential
equation. It is precisely such that the  whole
integrand vanishes leaving us only with the boundary terms
c31 
_p^(3) ^2_F_i- contribution   
&=& 2  r_0^7-2p  x^p-3  x-1  _x f^2(x)
_x= 


&-&2  r_0^7-2p  x^p-3  x-1  _x f^2(x)
_x=1   .
But due to the boundary condition (), only the 
term at  remains.
So all we have to do is to determine the two solutions of the 
hypergeometric differential equation () that 
satisfy one or the other  boundary condition
 () and check 
whether  has 
a finite limit as  goes to . This is done in 
appendix  with the result that, for ,  

 always diverges.
We conclude that all  with  must vanish, i.e. 
. This completes the proof of our proposition.


As already noted, it is straightforward to generalise
the proposition. First, in the metric one can replace 
 by a more general function  provided
it also vanishes linearly in  as the singularities are
approached. Indeed, this is all that was used to decide the
convergence or divergence of the integrals. Furthemore, if
 is -dimensional, the exponents  and  
are replaced by  and . The only novelty occurs 
for odd . Then, if  is the middle value , 
both terms in the equation replacing () 
have a factor  and diverge. Also, in this
case, changing variables from  to  with 
 and ,
eq. () gets replaced by 
 and the 
r.h.s. of () by 
. Evidently, no 
solutions of finite norm exist. We conclude that the 
following generalisation holds:

Corollary :   Let  by any smooth compact 
-dimensional manifold and  
an -dimensional manifold with metric given by 
c32 
s^2_X=r^2 + h(r)^2 s^2_Y  ,
r_1rr_2  ,
with a smooth function  that behaves as 
 as  and  
as . We  require that  is 
such that for  the differential equation
c33c 
( (h(r))^n+2-2p  f'(r))' =
 (h(r))^n-2p   f(r)  
has no solution  such that
c34c 
 _r_1 ^r_2  r   [ (h(r))^n-2p 
(f(r))^2 + (h(r))^n+2-2p (f'(r))^2 ] 
(h(r))^n+2-2p  f(r) f'(r) ^r_2 _r_1 
is finite.
Then the -harmonic -forms 
on  are given, for , by the trivial 
extensions of the harmonic -forms on , while for 
 they are 
given by their Hodge duals on . If  is odd, 
there are no -harmonic 
-forms on .

Conclusions and discussion 

The compactifications of M-theory on manifolds of - 
or weak -holonomy lead to  sypersymmetry 
in four dimensions. If the compact -holonomy manifolds 
have conical singularities,
interesting four-dimensional physics emerges, involving 
charged chiral fermions and anomalies. As a matter of fact, no
explicit metric on such singular spaces exists.
In this paper, we constructed metrics on compact 
seven-manifolds with two conical singularities which carry
weak -holonomy. To do so, we started from any
(non-compact) -holonomy manifold  which
is asymptotic to a cone on some  and derived 
various properties of . The corresponding weak 
-holonomy manifolds then can be taken to be 
the direct product of an interval and the 
six-manifold , where the metric involves a warp 
factor .
 
Although the compactification on these manifolds
results in a four-dimensional anti-de Sitter space, 
we can read off useful information from models of 
that kind. In particular, we again expect charged chiral 
fermions living at the singularities which will in 
general lead to anomalies. A better understanding 
of the mechanism of anomaly cancellation might be 
obtained by studying these explicitly known weak
-manifolds.
 
One question that arose while studying anomalies on 
singular spaces was the determination 
of the gauge group  and more generally 
of the cohomology of . For the manifolds 
we constructed, these questions were answered 
unambiguously. The reason is that the structure of 
the weak -manifold is almost entirely determined 
by the 6-manifold . In particular, the cohomology of
 can be inferred from the cohomology of ,
with the Betti numbers being related as
 for . Thus,
Poincare duality and vanishing first Betti number
are maintained although 
is singular. An important ingredient was the physically 
motivated restriction to square-integrable forms only.
We also generalised this result to 
arbitrary  and more general warp 
factors . 
As an interesting consequence of these 
facts we find that the gauge group 
coincides with . For the standard examples 
 and  we 
thus get gauge groups  and no gauge 
group, respectively.

To generate non-abelian gauge groups one could divide
the weak -manifolds by , with
 acting non-trivially on . It is rather 
straightforward to discuss the resulting orbifolds 
and what happens at the two conical singularities,
but this is beyond the scope of the present paper.

Appendix 

In this appendix we collect some useful formulas and 
prove some results needed in the main text. 

Projectors on the  and  
of  

Every antisymmetric tensor  transforming as 
the 21  of SO(7) can always be decomposed into
a piece  transforming as the 
14  of  (called self-dual) and a piece 
 transforming 
as the 7  of  (called anti-self-dual):
fa0 
A^ab &=&A^ab _+ + A^ab _-


A^ab _+&=&23  ( A^ab 
+14  ^abcd  A^cd )   ,
^abc  A_+^bc =0  ,


A^ab _-&=&13  ( A^ab 
-12  ^abcd  A^cd ) 
=16  _abc  _cde  A^de   ,
where
fa5 
_abcd = 13! ^abcdefg _efg  .
In particular, one has
fa0q 
^ab  ^ab = _+^ab  _+^ab  + _-^ab  _-^ab   .
Self-duality and the 3-form 

It will be useful to have an  explicit representation for 
the -matrices in 7 dimensions. 
A convenient representation is in 
terms of the  asfa3 
(_a)_AB  = i(_aAB  
+_aA _8B 
-_aB _8A )  .
Here  while  and
it is understood that  if  or  
equals 8. One then hasfa4 
(_ab )_AB  &=& _abAB 
+_abA _8B -_abB _8A 
+_aA _bB -_aB _bA 


(_abc )_AB  &=& 
i_abc  (_AB -2_8A _8B )
-3i_A[ab _c]B 
-3i_B[ab _c]A 


& &-i_abcA _8B 
-i_abcB _8A   .
Now we can prove the following:

Lemma :  Let  be the 3-form that satisfies
, for -holonomy,
or , for weak -holonomy.(
Here do not distinguish between  and  but 
use the same symbol  since both cases are treated 
in parallel.) 
Then  is given by
fa1 
16  _abc  e^ae^be^c
if and only if the spin connection is self-dual, 
i.e. satisfies .

As explained in, from the covariantly
constant spinor () one can always construct 
a covariantly constant 3-form
fa2 
i6   ^T_abc  e^ae^be^c  .
This implies that  is closed
() and co-closed ().
For weak -holonomy, one defines the 3-form
 in exactly the same way by (), but
now  obeys the Killing spinor property ().
It then follows that  obeys .
Thus () is the correct 3-form . To see 
under which condition it reduces to () 
we use the explicit representation for 
the -matrices () given above.  
It is then easy to see that
 if and only if 
. This means that our 3-form 
is given by () if and only if the covariantly 
constant, resp. Killing spinor  only has an eighth 
component, which then must be a constant which we can 
take to be 1. With this normalisation we have
fa6 
^T_abc = -i _abc   ,

so that  is correctly given by ().
From the above 
explicit expression for  one then deduces that 
 and
.
Also, , so that
eq. (), resp. () reduces to
.

Compatibility of self-duality and 
cohomogeneity-one 

Next we want to investigate the compatibility of 
cohomogeneity-one 
and self-dual choices of frame. A cohomogeneity-one choice of 
frame is one where
fa7 
e^7=r  , e^() (r)  ^so that 
fa8 
^ = h_() (r) h_() (r)  ^   , 
^7 =h_() '(r) ^ .

We have already seen in the main text that for weak 
-holonomy with  this is incompatibel 
with the self-duality condition
. So let now .
Then the self-duality conditions become
fa9 
_7   h_() (r) h_() (r)  ^  &=& 0


2 _7  h_() '(r) ^
+ _   h_() (r) h_() (r)  ^   &=& 0
 .
In general, this provides constraints on the  
since all  dependence is carried by them. One simple 
solution to solve the -dependence in these equations 
is to take all  equal and  to 
be a constant which can be chosen to equal 1. This solution 
of course corresponds to the case where  and
 is a cone on . Then equations () simply
translate into conditions on the choice of frame on :
fa10 
_7   ^  = 0  , _  ^ = - 2  _7  ^ .
These conditions look similar to the self-duality conditions
for weak -holonomy, but they are conditions in 
6 dimensions on . Actually, as pointed out in the main 
text, if  is a cone on , the -holonomy of  implies
that  has weak -holonomy.
Similarly as 
in one can show that for a weak -holonomy 
manifold one can always chose a frame such that () 
holds. This then shows that for a -holonomy manifold 
that is a cone on , the cohomogeneity-one frame can also 
be chosen to be self-dual.




Relating Hodge duals 

We need to relate Hodge duals on the 7-manifolds , 
 or  to the Hodge duals on the 6-manifold . 
For the present purpose, we do not need to specify the 
7-manifold and just call it . We assume that the 
7-beins of , called , and the 6-beins of , 
called  can be related by
fa20 
e^7=r  , e^h(r) ^ .
We denote the Hodge dual of a form  on  simply
by  while the 6-dimensional Hodge dual of
a form  on  is denoted .

The duals of -forms on  and on  are defined in 
terms of their respective viel-bein basis, namely
fa21 
( e^a_1  e^a_p ) =1(7-p)! 
^a_1a_p _a_1a_p  b_1b_7-p  
e^b_1  e^b_7-p   
and
fa22 
( ^_1  ^_p ) =1(6-p)! 
^_1_p __1_p  _1_6-p  
^_1  ^_6-p    .
Here the -tensors are the "flat" ones that equal .
Expressing the  in terms of the  provides the 
desired relation. In particular,
for a -form  on  we have 
fa23 
( r _p) &=& h(r)^6-2p 
_p 

_p &=& (-)^p h(r)^6-2p 
r _p  ,
where we denote both the form on  and its trivial
extension onto  by the same symbol .

Properties of the hypergeometric 
equation 

Here, we want to show that all 
solutions  of the 
hypergeometric equation () with  
that satisfy either of the two boundary conditions 
() are such that 
 diverges 
as .

The standard form of the hypergeometric equation is 
hyper 
x(1-x) f"(x) + [c-(a+b+1)x] f'(x) - ab f(x) = 0  .
The coefficients of our hypergeometric equation
() correspond to 
c31a 
a=12  ( p + p^2+_i ) ,
b=12  ( p - p^2+_i ) ,
c=p-3  ,

with . 
As is well-known, there is a 
systematic way to obtain pairs of linearly independent 
solutions of the hypergeometric differential equation with  
cuts on  various combinations of the intervals 
,  and . They are given 
by the Kummer solutions  each of which 
can be expressed in four different ways. Since we 
implicitly assumed that the  are real, we have to be 
careful to choose  solutions  that are real on the 
positive real axis for .

For our present purpose, it is convenient to consider 
the following pair of linearly independent solutions
c32f 
u_2(x)&=&F(a,b;a+b+1-c;1-x)  ,


u_6(x)&=&(1-x)^c-a-b  F(c-a,c-b;c+1-a-b;1-x)  ,
where  are given above and  is the usual 
hypergeometric function. The function  has a cut when its 
argument  is in the interval . But this 
corresponds to  and is irrelevant to us. However, 
for ,
the power of  in front of  has a simple square-root 
branch cut from 1 to  since .
Hence we define
c33 
f_1(x)&=&u_2(x)


f_2(x)&=& e^i(c-a-b)   u_6(x+i)=
 (x-1)^c-a-b  F(c-a,c-b;c+1-a-b;1-x)


which are real and defined without any ambiguity for 
real  and
satisfy the boundary condition ()
since 
c33a 
f_1(1)&=&1 , 
2x-1  _x f_1(x) _x=1  = 0  ,

 
f_2(1)&=&0 , 
2x-1  _x f_2(x) _x=1  = 1  .
To investigate the behaviour of these
solutions as , one uses the formula 
 for the analytic continuation expressing 
 or  as  linear combinations of  and , 
both of 
which behave as powers of  as :
c34 
f_1(x) && 
(a+b+1-c)(b-a)(b+1-c)(b)  
(x^-a  + )
+
(a+b+1-c)(a-b)(a+1-c)(a)  
(x^-b  + )  ,


f_2(x) && 
(c+1-a-b)(b-a)(1-a)(c-a)  
(x^-a  + )
+
(c+1-a-b)(a-b)(1-b)(c-b)  
(x^-b  + )  ,


where the dots indicate terms that are subleading by 
integer powers of . In our case,  and the 
leading terms in  and  as  
are the -terms, unless their
coefficients, which we will call  and , happen to 
vanish. This can only happen if , ,
 or  is a non-positive integer, which is 
impossible since . 
We conclude that, as , for both solutions we have 
c35 
x^p-3  x-1  _x f_i^2(x)
d_i^2 x^p -2b  
= d_i^2 x^p^2+_i     as  x, i=1,2 .
This diverges for all  and  and, 
by eq. (), 
so does the corresponding contribution to
.
