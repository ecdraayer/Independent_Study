    Introduction 
 Since the   discovery of superstring dualities,   four-dimensional  
supersymmetric quantum
  field theories ()  have been a  subject  of great interest 
in connection with superstring compactification on Calabi-Yau manifolds and 
D-brane physics. For example,  embedding    in 
type IIA superstring  compactified on Calabi-Yau threefolds,  with K3 
fibration, has found a very nice geometric description using the so-called 
geometric engineering method. In this program, these 
models, which give  exact results for the moduli space of  the type IIA  Coulomb  
branch, are represented by Dynkin quiver diagrams of  Lie algebras 
. Quite  recently, a special interest has been devoted  to four-dimensional  
gauge models preserving only four supercharges.  These field  models  
admit a very nice description  in the so-called   webs [13-24].   
This method concerns the study of   four-dimensional quiver 
theories  arising on the world-volume of D3-branes  transverse to singular 
Calabi-Yau threefolds, . The subscript here refers to type IIB string
geometry. The manifolds are complex cones over complex   two-dimensional toric 
varieties  , e.g. del  Pezzo  surfaces.   
They are mirror manifolds of local Calabi-Yau threefolds  given 
by  elliptic and   fibrations over the  complex plane.  Under local 
mirror symmetry, a  D3-brane in type IIB geometry  becomes a D6-brane 
wrapping a   in type IIA mirror geometry. In this way, the  
four-dimensional quiver theories can be obtained from 
D6-branes wrapping 3-cycles  in the mirror manifold.  For instance, a 
D6-brane on   ,  whose   homology class is 
 
 [T^3] = _i=1 ^n_i S_i,  
      where  form a basis of , 
gives   a   four-dimensional  supersymmetric   gauge theory with    
gauge   group
           G=_i=1 ^  U(n_i), 
     and   quiver matrix 
I _ij = S_iS_j.  
     In  eqs. (1.1) and (1.2),   the  vector   is    specified by the  
anomaly cancellation  condition
        _i=1 ^  I_ij n_i=0.
       The above  identities in the method of  webs  are very exciting. 
First, the same  equation  forms   have  been used in the 
geometric engineering of  superconformal  models with eight  supercharges.  
In this case, the quiver matrix is identified  with an affine   Cartan 
matrix   and the gauge group is  
.  The positive integers  appearing in    are the usual
Dynkin weights.  They form a special positive definite integer vector 
 satisfying , as  required by the vanishing  of the beta
 function.  Second, for  corresponding to complex  two-dimensional  
weighted  projective spaces in type IIB geometry,    the   physics content 
with unitary gauge groups and charged chiral matter  seems to be similar 
to four-dimensional   models obtained from  M-theory  on singular 
 manifolds  studied first in , see also.   
These manifolds are constructed as circle quotients of eight-dimensional toric 
hyper-Kahler (HK) manifolds.  Following,   the twistor space  
over the  weighted projective space  has  an 
interpretation in type IIA superstring as an intersection of three groups of 
D6-branes with multiplicities  leading to  
gauge symmetry.   According to this  feature, one might  ask the 
following question. Is there a connection between the  approach of  
webs and M-theory on  manifolds( Besides this similarity, 
much of the D6-branes physics content can be interpreted in M-theory on 
local  manifolds, leading to  supersymmetric models in four 
dimensions.) ?  However,  this connection may naturally lead  to the need 
of a reformulation of the method of  webs. The reason for this 
is that the gauge symmetry  in the M-theory compactification involves  
the weights of the weighted projective space  .
 In   this paper we address this question using toric geometry data of 
 manifolds as   quotients of eight-dimensional HK manifolds,  
and by reconsidering the method of  webs. This study may complete 
the analysis of   dealing with   discrete   
 orbifolds     using the McKay correspondence.

 Our program will  proceed   in two steps:

(i) We study   manifolds as 
  quotients of eight-dimensional toric HK manifolds,  
. The manifold   is  obtained  using relevant  
constraint  equations in terms of two-dimensional   sigma-models  
with  gauge symmetry and  hypermultiplets.    
We show that the resulting seven-dimensional  manifolds,  in general,   
are given by  real cones on    bundles 
over complex two-dimensional toric varieties
 
 
 Explicit  models   are  presented 
in terms  of two-dimensional   sigma model  realizations  
of  . 

(ii)  We discuss the link between  the physics content of M-theory on 
such  manifolds and the methods of   webs.  In particular, 
we reconsider and   reformulate  the  web    equations 
using the toric geometry  Mori vectors  of   
and set of brane  charge constraint equations. For the  weighted projective 
space , for example, we find   the following   
gauge    group 
      G=U( w_1n)U(w_2n)U(w_3n). 
This is required by the anomaly cancellation  condition. With an  appropriate choice of weight vectors, 
we recover the result of Acharya and Witten given in. 
 The plan of
 this paper is as follows.  In  section 2, we  briefly review the main 
lines of toric
geometry  method for  treating   complex manifolds. Then we give the 
interplay between  the toric geometry and two-dimensional  
supersymmetric gauge theories.   In section 3, we
  study   manifolds as    quotients of
   eight-dimensional toric HK manifolds   constructed  from  
-flatness conditions of two-dimensional field theory with    supersymmetric.  Then we identify the   symmetry group with   the toric
  geometry circle actions  of  to   present  quotients 
 of   holonomy.  Explicit  models   are given
  in  terms of real  cones  on an   bundle over  complex two-dimensional
  toric varieties . In section 4,  we engineer 
 quiver models from  manifolds. We discuss the link 
between  the physics content of M-theory on such  manifolds and 
the method  of   webs.  We reconsider and  
reformulate  the  equations using the toric geometry  Mori vectors  of   and set of brane charge constraint equations. 
In particular,  for the  weighted projective space 
, we find that the   gauge group  is given by (1.6). 
        In section 5, we give illustrating  applications. 
         In
  section 6,   we give our conclusion.
       Toric geometry 

  In  this section,  we  collect a  few facts  on  toric geometry
 of complex manifolds. These facts   are  needed  later to   construct  
a special  type of
     manifolds,  as    quotients of eight-dimensional 
 toric HK  manifolds.  Roughly speaking, toric manifolds are complex
  -dimensional manifolds
   with  fibration over -dimensional  base spaces with boundary
 .
    They exhibit
    toric actions   allowing us   to encode the
  geometric properties of the complex spaces in terms of simple
  combinatorial data of polytopes  of the  space.
  In this correspondence, fixed points of the toric actions 
  are associated with the vertices of the polytope , the
  edges are fixed one-dimensional lines of a subgroup 
  of the toric action , and so on.  Geometrically, this means
  that  the  fibers   can degenerate over the boundary of the
  base.  Note that in the case where the base space is compact, the
  resulting toric  manifold  will be compact as well.
 
 In string theory,  the power  of the toric geometry  representation 
 is due to the following  points: 

   (1) The  toric data of the  polytope   have similar features  
 to  the   Dynkin diagrams leading to non-abelian  gauge symmetries in 
type II superstring compactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds.
   (2)  The toric fixed   loci, which correspond to
  the vanishing cycles, have been known to be associated with 
D-brane  charges.  The latter   will be  used  in section 4 
 to discuss    the physics content
  of M-theory on our   proposed manifolds of   holonomy, using  a
 reformulation of the method of   webs in type II superstring on  
 Calabi-Yau threefolds.
   To illustrate the main idea of  toric geometry, let us
  describe  the philosophy of this subject  through certain useful  examples.

   (i)   projective space .

   This is the simplest example in toric geometry which turns out to
   play a crucial role in  the  building
   blocks  of higher-dimensional toric  
varieties  and  in the study of the small resolution of   
singularities of  local  Calabi-Yau manifolds.
  has an 
   toric action
 ze^i  zwith  two fixed points
   and  on the real line. The latter  points,  which  can
  be generally chosen as  and , describe
  respectively north and south poles of the real two sphere 
. The corresponding one-dimensional polytope is just
  the segment  joining the two points  and .
  Thus,  can be viewed as a segment   with a
  circle on top,  where the circle vanishes at the end points 
  and .
  
 (ii)  projective space. 

       is a complex  two-dimensional toric variety defined by 
   
   where     acts as follows  
      
 It  admits   an   toric action (z_1,z_2,  z_3 ) ( e^i
  _1  z_1,e^i _2  z_2, z_3 ), exhibiting three
  fixed points ,  and . The corresponding polytope
   is a finite sublattice of the  square lattice.
  It describes the intersection of three 's   defining a
  triangle () in the  plane. A convenient choice
  of the data of these  three vertices  is as follows : ,
  , and . Thus,   has three edges, 
  namely ,  and  stable under the
  three  subgroups of ; two subgroups are just the two
   factors,  while the third subgroup is the diagonal one. 
  can be viewed as a triangle over
  each point of which there is an elliptic curve  . This torus  
 shrinks to a
  circle at each segment     and  it shrinks to a  point at
 each .  The above  toric realization can be pushed further for 
describing the same phenomenon involving complex  -dimensional toric  
 varieties  that are more complicated than projective spaces.  The latter
 spaces  can   be expressed in the following form
   
  where  now we have   actions  given by 
   
    In this equation,   are integers. For each  they form
the so-called  Mori
  vectors in toric  geometry. They   generalize  the  weight vector  
 of the  complex  -dimensional  weighted projective space  
 .   is a subset  of 
   chosen by triangulation. 
  
 
 Eq. (2.5) means  that    has a     fibration, 
 obtained
    by dividing     by the   gauge symmetry 
        z_ie^iQ^a_i ^a  z_i,a=1,,r,
       where  are the generators of the  factors.  
  can 
 be  represented by a  toric 
     diagram  spanned by  
     vertices  of an   lattice satisfying 
       
   The  toric  geometry manifolds we have been describing  have  an
 interesting
  realization   through    linear sigma models,    where one considers
  two-dimensional   supersymmetric   gauge systems  with 
 gauge
  group  and     chiral  fields   with  a 
  matrix
  charge.  In this way, the Kahler manifold   
 is  the minimum  of the
  -term potential (), up to  gauge transformations,
  namely
        
  where  the 's are Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) coupling parameters.
  The (local) Calabi-Yau condition  is satisfied by
   
   which means that the  system  flows in the infra-red to a non-trivial
  superconformal
  theory. 
 Under local  mirror symmetry,  this toric  Calabi-Yau sigma model maps
 to Landau-Ginsburg (LG) models.  In this  way, 
 the mirror version  of the constraint equation  (2.9),   giving the LG
 superpotential,  reads 
_i y_i=0
subject to
_i y_i^Q_i^a =e^-t_a , 
 where  are  LG  dual  chiral fields which can be related, up some 
field changes, to sigma model fields,   
and where  's are the complexified FI parameters defining  now the  
complex deformations  of  the LG Calabi-Yau superpotentials.



  Note that  the  above two-dimensional   toric sigma   models can be
 extended to   sypersymmetry models  with hypermultiplets leading to
 toric  HK geometries.  In the rest of this paper, we will use 
toric geometry and HK   analysis  to study seven-dimensional   manifolds
  with
  holonomy. The latter  are    quotients of  eight-dimensional 
toric HK  manifolds .  
    manifolds as    quotients 
          manifolds  and   -flatness conditions  
 It is known that in order to get a semi-realistic four-dimensional theory
 from M-theory  it is necessary to consider a compactification  on
 a seven-dimensional  manifold   with  holonomy  [42-51]. 
 In this way, the resulting   models with  supersymmetry  depend 
on the geometric properties of . For instance, if  is smooth,
 the low-energy theory contains, in addition  to  supergravity,
 only abelian gauge symmetry and no charged chiral fermions. Non-abelain
 gauge  symmetries can be obtained by considering limits  where  
develops   orbifold  singularities using wrapped  M2-branes on 
vanishing 2-cycles.  However, the presence of  conical
 singularities  leads  to  charged chiral  fermions. 
 Following, an interesting analysis for building such 
geometries is to consider quotients of
 eight-dimensional toric  HK  manifolds  by an    circle symmetry. 
  The   group has been  chosen such  that it commutes with the  
 symmetry,  permuting the three  complex structures of HK geometries. 
 A priori,    there are  many ways  to choose the   group  action.
 Two situations   have been given in but here we will identify
 the   group  with the  toric  geometry  circle action  of complex 
 subvarieties
  within  HK geometries. In  particular, we will  use  the HK analysis
 to present  explicit models  with  holonomy group leading to 
interesting  supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions.
 To do so,   we consider  two-dimensional   
supersymmetric gauge theories  with     gauge symmetries   and 
  hypermultiplets with  a    matrix charge.   The 
   -flatness
   equations  of such models   are  generally given by
       _i=1 ^r+2  Q^a_i

=_a
          ^_, a=1,,r.
             In these equations,
            's
          denote      component field doublets of
          hypermultiplets,  are   FI 3-vector
 couplings  rotated by 
          symmetry, and
            are the
          traceless  Pauli matrices.
             In
  this construction,
             for  each
   factor, there are three real constraint equations
  transforming as  an iso-triplet of  -symmetry ()
  acting on the HK structures.
 Using the  transformations
  ^ &=&^ _  ,  _12 =^21 =1

  (^) &=& _,   and
  replacing the Pauli matrices by their expressions, the identities
  (3.1) can be
   split as
  follows  _i=1 ^k Q_i^a(
  ^1_i^2-^2_i^2) &= &^3 _a
 _i=1 ^kQ_i^a
  ^1_i  _i ^2&=&^1_a+i^2 _a
  

  _i=1 ^k Q_i^a^2_i
   _i ^1&=&^1_a-i^2 _a. Dividing the
  resulting  space of  (3.3-5) by   gauge transformations,
  we find precisely an   
eight-dimensional toric HK manifold   .   However,  
 explicit  solutions of these geometries  depend on the values of the FI
   couplings.  Taking     and
  ,  (3.3-5) describe the
  cotangent bundle over  complex  two-dimensional toric varieties.  Indeed, if we set all ,   we get a  complex  two-dimensional toric variety    defined by  
  _i=1 ^2+r  Q_i^a^1_i^2 = ^3 _a, 
a=1,,ror  equivalently  
 
 
 Equations (3.4-5) mean
  that the 's define the cotangent orthogonal  fiber
  directions over . To better understand the structure
 of (3.3-5),  let us
  give an illustrating
application.  Consider   a model with an   gauge
  symmetry  and   hypermultiplets  with a vector charge
  . Taking  and , eqs (3.3-5)
  reduce to
     _i=1 ^3(
  ^1_i^2-^2_i^2) = ^3,  
and   _i=1 ^3 ^1_i  _i ^2=0, 
_i=1 ^3 ^1_i   _i ^2=0.Setting
  , eq. (3.8) becomes    ^1_1^2+
  ^1_2^2+^1_3^2 = ^3 and defines, up the 
    gauge  transformation,   .  Equation
  (3.9), however, means that  parameterize the
   orthogonal cotangent directions over .



 We have given a simple   example   corresponding to a  massive model.  
  In what  follows,  we will consider   special  models  corresponding to  
 conformal sigma model.  For  this reason, we will   restrict ourselves
 to     eight-dimensional  toric HK  manifolds  with the Calabi-Yau
 condition  
 
 in    supersymmetric systems.
   In this way,  the geometry of  
 depends on the manner we  choose   the     matrix  gauge charge
  satisfying (3.11).   Each   matrix charge   corresponds to a 
definite  eight-dimensional  manifold .  
To build seven-dimensional  manifolds,       
with  holonomy, we shall use   one finite toric
  geometry  circle action. The cotangent  bundle over
   is a local
      complex   four-dimensional   
       toric variety. Using the materials given in 
section 2, it is  easy  to see that this geometry
         has  four toric geometry  circle actions:
        .   Two  of them   correspond 
to the
    toric
      base space
       denoted by  , 
      while  the remaining ones, ,  act on  the  fiber
    orthogonal   cotangent directions.
      To get the   corresponding seven-dimensional manifolds with 
    holonomy, we will
       identify   the  group symmetry  of the quotient used in 
  with
         one  finite circle toric action.  Identifying this  
  symmetry  with one  , one finds the
 following
         seven-dimensional  manifold
    X_7=X_8/ U(1)_fiber  ,
          Since 

,  this  quotient  space  is now 
 isomorphic to an  bundle over  a  .
   Similarly to,  equation (3.12)  describes   real  cones  on 
 a   bundle
   over .
  Mathematically,  it is not easy to  reveal  that these quotient  spaces 
have    holonomy  group. However, one can show this using 
 a physical argument. Indeed,  , with , 
 preserves  of initial supercharges  and in the 
 presence of  it  should be  . In this  way,  
 the supersymmetry tells us that  the holonomy of (3.12)
 is the   Lie group.  
 Thus,   M-theory on  the above    seven-dimensional   manifold leads to
   theory in four dimensions.

 
     Explicit models from   geometries 
  As the space of solutions of (3.12) depend on  , we
 shall give  explicit models  in terms of   toric sigma model 
 realizations  of     . We first study 
  complex  two-dimensional weighted
    projective  spaces  , after which we will consider
      the Hirzebruch surfaces. Other extended   models   are also presented.
     as weighted projective spaces 
      For  constructing  these models,   we  consider  an    gauge
 symmetry 
  with three
     hypermultiplets   of charges   such that
       Q_1+Q_2+Q_3=0.
          This condition  means that the corresponding   model  can
 flow to a non-trivial
    conformal field theory. It turns out that  there are many ways  to 
  satisfy ().   One  way is  as follows
      Q_1&=&m_1
 Q_2&=&  -m_1-m_2
Q_3&=& m_2.
      This physics system gives    as a base 
geometry in the  structures. 
          Using examples,  let us  see how we obtain this  geometry. 



              Example 1:   .
 This example 
 corresponds to  
  three
     hypermultiplets  with  the     vector charge 
     Q_i= (1,-2,1).
 The corresponding  -flatness  is given by
      (^1_1 ^2-2^1_2 ^2+^1_3 ^2)-(^2_1 
   ^2-2^2_2 ^2+^2_3^2)&=&

  ^1_1 ^2 _1 +^1_3 ^2 
  _3 -2^1_2  ^2 _2 &=&0
  

  ^2_1 ^1 _1 +^2_3 ^1 
  _3 -2^2_2  ^1 _2 &=&0.After permuting
  the role of  and
   , the above equations may be rewritten as
      (^1_1 ^2+^1_3 ^2+2-^2_2   ^2)-
   (^2_1 
   ^2+^2_2 ^2+
   2^1_3^2)&=&

  ^1_1 ^2 _1 +^1_3 ^2  _3 +2
  ^1_2  (-^2 _2 ) &=&0
  

  ^2_1 ^1 _1 +^2_3 ^1 
  _3 +2(-^2_2 ) ^1 _2 &=&0.Making the
  following  field changes  ^1_1 =_1,  ^2_1 =_1 
 ^1_3 =_2,  ^2_3 =_3 
 - ^2_2  =_2,  ^1_2  =_2,    
eqs. (3.19-21)  become
      (_1 ^2+_3 ^2+2_2 ^2)-(_1 
   ^2+_3 
   ^2+2_2^2)
   &=&^3 

  _1 _1  +_3   _3  +2_2 _2   &=&0
  
 _1   _1  +  _3  _3 +2_2  _2 &=&0.   To handle these constraint equations, it is 
  interesting to  note that they are quite  similar to eqs. (3.8-10).
  Using the same analysis, they   describe a cotangent bundle over 
 .   Indeed,   taking  ,
       eq. (3.22) reduces to 
  _1 ^2+_3 ^2+2_2 ^2
   =^3,
     or equivalently 
  v_1+2v_2+v_3=0.
    This defines    a   weighted
    projective
    space,  where  
  is a Kahler real parameter controlling its  size.   Eqs.
  (3.23-24), for generic values  of , can be interpreted to
  mean that    parameterize  the  orthogonal fiber
  directions on  . Thus, the   total space  is isomorphic
 to the cotangent  bundle  over ,
 . Dividing by one
  finite  toric geometry circle action, we  find  a real cone on an 
    bundle over  with   holonomy.


   Example 2:  . 
 As another example,   we consider a
  vector charge   as  follows
  Q_i=(1, -3, 2).
This example is
  quite similar to the first
    one,  and its treatment  will be  parallel to the first one. We will
 see  later that this  geometry   leads to a four-dimensional model 
 which might  be  related to   the  grand unified  symmetry.
    After  making similar field changes,  this example describes  
 
 in the  base geometry of an eight-dimensional manifold. 
    After the  quotient,  the corresponding seven-dimensional 
 manifold
      will be     a real cone  on    bundle over
 .
    as   Hirzebruch  surfaces            
Hirzebruch  surfaces    are complex  two-dimensional toric
 surfaces  defined by non-trivial fibrations of
 a  over  a . These may be viewed as the
 compactification of  complex  line bundles  over   by adding
 a point to each fiber at infinity. Such line bundles  are classified by 
an  integer , being the first Chern class integrated over ; 
  the corresponding geometry is denoted 
by . For simplicity,  we will restrict ourselves to 
     with a  trivial fibration.
 To  write down  the   theoretical   physics
      realization  describing  , it is useful to
   start with   one   model and then  extend
   the result to .
    One    corresponds to an   two-dimensional   
  linear sigma model with two hypermultiplets  with  a vector charge
  .  The
  -flatness conditions of this model read
   (
  ^1_1^2-^1_2^2) -( ^2_1^2-^2_2^2)&= &^3
  

   ^1_1
   _1 ^2-_2^1  _2 ^2&=&0
  

  _1^2  ^1 _1-^2_2  ^1 _2&=&0.
     Permuting the role of  and ,  and
  making the following field changes ,
  ,   and 
, the constraint equations (3.28-30) become    ( _1^2+_2^2) -( _1^2+_2^2)&=
  &^3 

   _1
   _1+_2  _2 &=&0
  

  _1 _1  + _2_2  &=&0. 
      and describe  the  cotangent bundle over  a ,  defined by
       _1^2+_2^2=^3.     This model can be extended to  geometry by  considering  
two orthogonal copies of   in the  base geometry.  This involves 
  an     two-dimensional     
linear sigma model with four  hypermultiplets   with  the following  charges
        Q_i^(1) &=&(1,-1,0,0)

           Q_i^(2) &=&(0,0,1,-1).
              Making   a  similar analysis, the
   -flatness conditions (3.1)  reduce to     ( _1 ^2+ _2^2) -( _1 ^2+_2 ^2)&=
  &^3_1 
 ( _3 ^2+ _4^2) -(
  _3 ^2+_4 ^2)&= &^3_2 

   _1 
   _1 +_2  _2 &=&0
  

  _1   _1 + _2 
   _2&=&0
 _3 
   _3 +_4  _4 &=&0
  

  _3   _3 + _4 
   _4&=&0. Taking   , these
 equations reduce to  the following  -flatness   constraint equations of  
 two-dimensional   sigma model   with  supersymmetry
   ( _1 ^2+ _2^2) &=
  &^3_1 
 ( _3 ^2+ _4^2) &= &^3_2

 defining   .  For generic values of , eqs. (3.36-41)
 describe  the  cotangent bundle over  . After dividing by one
 finite toric  geometry circle action, we get a real cone on  bundle
 over . 
  Other  models   from  
 In this
 subsection, 
  we study some  extended models    using more
  general  two-dimensional gauge theories with  supersymmetry.    
In particular,  we consider
  two possible   generalizations for  .  The first model
 describes   the  blowing  up  of    at one  point. It has 
a  similar feature as    geometry.   The second  model 
leads to    intersecting geometries. 
     Blowing  up  of    
 For  simplicity,  we consider   as an example. 
  This space has   a    orbifold singularity
      corresponding to  non-trivial fixed points under the  homogeneous 
      identification
            (z_1,z_2,z_3)(z_1,^2 z_2,z_3).
        Taking    ,      has  a  orbifold
 singularity at 
.  This singularity  may be blown up by introducing an
 exceptional divisor.  In  two-dimensional   sigma model,  this  can be
  deformed  by introducing   an extra chiral
  field  and an  gauge group factor. In this way,  the corresponding eight-dimensional  manifolds 
 can be
 described by an  linear  sigma model with four hypermultiplets with 
the following  charges
                       Q_i^(1) &=&(1,-2,1,0)

           Q_i^(2) &=&(0,-1,0,1).Using the same procedure, the
   -flatness conditions (3.1)  reduce to    (_1 ^2+_3 ^2+2_2 ^2)-(_1 
   ^2+_3 
   ^2+2_2^2)
   &=&^3_1
 ( _3 ^2+ _4^2) -(
  _3 ^2+_4 ^2)&= &^3_2 

   _1 
   _1 +_2  _2 &=&0
  

  _1   _1 + _2 
   _2&=&0
 _3 
   _3 +_4  _4 &=&0
  

  _3   _3 + _4 
   _4&=&0.  In this case,  the base  geometry   is given by  the following  
   _1 ^2+_3 ^2+2_2 ^2
   &=&^3_1
  _3 ^2+ _4^2 &= &^3_2 
or equivalently
v_1+2v_1+v_3=0

v_3+v_4=0, 
where  are in a  lattice. 
Note that this model may give the same   
 manifold   corresponding to  the    Hirzebruch surface. 
      intersecting geometry  
   Another  generalization    is to consider the
   intersecting  weighted  projective  spaces according to   
 Dynkin diagrams by imitating the analysis of  sigma model.  These involve   two-dimensional     supersymmetric  gauge theory with 
    hypermultiplets  with     Cartan matrices as gauge charges. 
   For simplicity, let us consider the   Lie  algebra where the
   matrix charge is given by
    
  Putting  these   equations into the -flatness equations (3.1), one
  gets the following  system of  equations 
      (^1_a-1 ^2+^1_a+1 ^2-2^1_a ^2)-(^2_a-1 
   ^2+^2_a+1 ^2-
   2^2_a^2)&=&_a 

  ^1_a-1 ^2 _a-1 +^1_a+1 ^2 
  _a+1 -2^1_a  ^2 _a &=&0
  

  ^2_a-1 ^1 _a-1 +^2_a+1 ^1 
  _a+1 -2^2_a  ^1 _a &=&0 . An examination 
 of these equations  reveals   that 
    consists of
    intersecting
     according to the  Dynkin  diagram. 
 Actually,  this geometry   generalizes the usual   geometry 
corresponding to  two-cycles  of K3 surfaces .  The latter was introduced in
  string theory compactification to engineer more complicated gauge theories.   One expects to have a  similar  feature  in  M-theory on   compactifications.



 Note  that the previous  analysis could  be done  for   models with del Pezzo  surfaces as base geometry
  These   complex surfaces  can be  constructed by  blowing  up   seven  points  at zeroth
 Hirzebruch surfaces, or  by  blowing  up   eight   points at  . . Alternatively, 
 these  geometries    have been used   in the  building   of    supersymmetric gauge 
 theories in four dimensions using the so-called    webs.   These  gauge theories    
arise  on the world-volume of D3-branes  transverse to local Calabi-Yau threefolds  
 given by complex cones over  del Pezzo  surfaces.   Under mirror  symmetry,
  the corresponding  field   models  map  to  D6-branes wrapped on  
intersecting 3-cycles in .  This physics   could be  related to  the interpretation of M-theory on
  manifolds given by Acharya and Wittten.   In the rest of the 
present paper, we address  
this link using toric geometry data of   manifolds. 
  On  M-theory on    Manifolds   and  webs   
 So far, we have constructed a special type of  manifolds  as     quotients of
 eight-dimensional  toric HK  manifolds. 
   This section will be concerned  with M-theory on  such  manifolds.   We will try to find  a
 superstring interpretation of this using D-brane physics. In particular, we will discuss the 
connection between the physics content of  M-theory on  such   manifolds and the method of
   webs, leading to  supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions.  The analysis
 we will be using here is based on a 
reconsideration of the method of  webs   and reformulating 
 the intersection number structures in terms of toric geometry  data of   varieties. 


  Before  proceeding,  let us     quote  some crucial  points  supporting our discussion. 
 First,  according to ,   M-theory on  manifolds  as   quotient  of 
 eight-dimensional conical toric  HK   manifolds,  has an interpretation in terms of intersecting 
D6-branes in type  IIA superstring model.  In particular, the geometry of  
  describes  the intersection of
   three groups  of D6-branes, with multiplicities ,  and .
   The corresponding gauge group is
  given by the following    supersymmetric gauge  theory    SU(m)SU(m)SU(n)with chiral multiplets in the 
   bi-fundamental
  representation.  This gauge system   could be   represented  by  a    quiver     triangle  
which may be viewed as the toric geometry graph of .
 Second,   similar  physics content  models   can  appear  in type IIA superstring compactified on  local elliptic
 fibration  Calabi-Yau threefolds   in  the presence of    
D6-branes  
   wrapping      3-cycles    filling the four-dimensional Minkowski space-time. 
   In this representation, each 3-cycle  is associated to a
  single gauge group  factor and the intersection numbers    I_ij =S_iS_j
     count the number of 
   chiral multiplets which transform in the bi-fundamental
   representation.   Under mirror  symmetry, this model is  equivelent   to type 
IIB D3-branes transverse to local Calabi-Yau threefolds . 
The latter are    complex cones  over 
 del Pezzo surfaces or more  generally complex two-dimensional toric manifolds  .   The
 toric skeletons of these  varieties are defined by  the   web charges of   D5-branes. They    
correspond  to the loci of points at which some 1-cycles of the elliptic  curve  fibration  of 
  shrinks  to zero radius.   Following, the physics  content of these
 models   can be  determined explicitly from the geometry of the   webs.  Indeed,  if  
the vanishing 1-cycles  of the elliptic fibration 
   , the intersection  numbers,   in type IIA  mirror geometry,    read as 
   I_ij = S_iS_j= C_iC_j=p_iq_j-p_jq_i
 In this  representation, the set of the ranks  of the gauge groups  is a  null vector of this matrix.
 For example,      consider   with the   following  homology class 
[T^3] = _i=1  ^n_i S_i,  
      where   is  the   wrapping numbers.  The D6-branes 
wrapped on  this torus 
  give rise to   four-dimensional  supersymmetric   gauge theory with    gauge   group
           G=_i=1 ^U(n_i),
            where the  vector   is    specified by the  anomaly cancellation  condition
        _i=1 ^I_ij n_i=0.
     A priori, the  connection between  the method  of    webs  and the
 Acharya-Witten
  interpretation is not obvious.  
 After several attempts at the clarification, however, we arrived to the
 conclusion that the link could be  possible if we introduce the Mori vector charge  in the 
method of   webs. Our  solution   was  inspired by the following:

(1) The  study of  M-theory on local geometry of  Calabi-Yau threefolds  having  toric realization in terms of   D5-branes of
 type IIB superstrings.

(2)  The  result of  Acharya-Witten  on M-theory on  manifolds, where the set of ranks of 
gauge groups  coincide with   the weight  vector of the . 

(3) The  local mirror symmetry  application in type II superstrings, where the mirror 
constraint equations   involve the toric 
geometry data of the original manifolds.

 Besides  these points,  a  close examination of  the formulation of the     webs
   reveals, however,  that 
 the  matrix  intersection (4.3) appears in the ordinary and weighted projective spaces and 
 does not  carry  any  transparent toric geometry    data    distinguishing  these geometries. 
 Taking into  account this observation,  the connection we are after  leads  us to reformulate the
  intersection  number structures    by introducing  the  toric geometry Mori  vectors  and 
 a set of brane charge constraint equations.    
To make connection with  ,   we  restrict ourselves to the   weighted projective  
spaces  where  .  Given a set of  charges , ,   we propose the  intersection  number formula 
     I _ij  =w_iw_j (p_iq_j-p_iq_j)
    with the following constraint equations
    w_1^2 p_1+w_2^2p_2+w_3^2p_3=0

    w_1^2q_1+w_2^2q_2+w_3^2q_3=0.
     Now, the set of ranks  of the gauge groups    should  satisfy 
    _i I  _ij n_i=0, 
      as required by  the anomaly cancellation condition.  
Using equation (4.8),  it is easy to  see that   this condition    
can be  satisfied in terms of the weights of  as follows   
     n_i=w_in, 
     
and so the  corresponding gauge symmetry is given by       G=_i=1  U(w_in).
     
 Our   reformulation of the   webs  has the following nice features:

(1) This  formulation  is quite similar to the geometric engineering of
 four-dimensional 
  superconformal field theories with gauge  group
   where 
   the 's are the usual Dynkin labels  being a  null vector of
 affine Cartan matrices as
 required by the vanishing of the beta function.
 
(2)  For  , we recover the  simple model with gauge group   and  matter
 triplication in each bifundamental  . 
  (3)
 For , the corresponding   gauge theory  is now  
quite similar  to the interpretation
 of M-theory on  manifolds given  in. 
In this way, the gauge group  reads 
      G=_i=1 ^3 U(w_i).
     
 In the infra-red limit the  factors decouple and one is left with the gauge  symmetry 
      G=_i=1 ^3SU(w_i).
     
Taking  an appropriate  choice of weights, we recover  
the physical model given   
in equation (4.1).

(4) The corresponding field models  can be  represented by a  triangle quiver diagram



















 


 To  summarize,  the physics content of  M-theory  on such 
 manifolds,  with   base geometry,  might  be  equivalent to  type IIB superstring on
  complex lines on   in  the  presence of  brane  charges.  Performing 
  local mirror  symmetry, we  end with local elliptic type IIA geometry with D6-branes  filling
 four-dimensional space-time.  The corresponding gauge group and  quiver diagram can be
 obtained using  the   webs  toric geometry data of .   
    Illustrating Models 
In this section we   will  give  two   illustrating applications. They concern the examples
 studied in section 3:    and  .   
  
   gauge  theory 
   Consider,  first,   the geometry of    in M-theory compactifications.   In  webs, this  is equivalent to  taking three stacks of  branes  each, wrapping  the following  1 cycles
    C_1=(-2,0), C_2=(0,-1), C_3=(2,4). 
  
 In this case,  the intersection numbers read as 
I _12 &=&4

I _31 &=&8 

I  _23 &=&4.
  For one D6-brane, this   example leads to a      spectrum with gauge group   gauge group and bifundamental matter. 
 This model  agrees  with  the  result of  Acharya and Witten given   in.  While for   D6-branes, the above  charge configurations    gives a       spectrum with gauge group   gauge
symmetry  and bifundamental matter.

   gauge model 
 The geometry of   is  very exciting    in  this analysis
  because it may  lead  to the  symmetry of  the grand unified  theory (GUT) ( This  is not a  surprise  since
    it was shown in that one gets the GUT  gauge symmetry from  M-theory on   manifolds with  singularity) . 
  For this example,   we    consider  three stacks of  D6-branes  each, wrapping  the following  1 cycles
    C_1=(4,9), C_2=(-1,0), C_3=(0,-1). 
  
 In this case,  the  intersection numbers  read as 
I _12 &=&18

I _31 &=&12

I  _23 &=&6

 This   yields a      spectrum with gauge group  gauge group and bifundamental matter. For , one gets U(1) U(2) U(3)  as gauge symmetry. 
  Concluding   this section, it is interesting to   make a comment 
 regarding the numbers appearing in (5.2) and (5.4),  counting the  number of   chiral  multiplets  in the corresponding gauge systems.  The latter have  a remarkable feature which has a  nice interpretation using  the recent derivation of local   mirror symmetry in two-dimensional field theory with 
 supersymmetry. Indeed, in the above two  examples,   can be written as follows 
f_1&=&w_2w_3d 

f_2&=&w_1w_3d

f_3&=&w_1w_2dwhere   is   the degree of the following  homogeneous  LG  Calabi-Yau superpotentials   
y^2 +x^4  +z^4  +e^txyz&=&0

y^2 +x^3  +z^6  +e^txyz&=&0
 mirror to type IIB   sigma model on the anti-canonical line bundles  over
  and    respectively. 
   Conclusion 
   In this paper, we have studied     supersymmetric   gauge theories 
embedded in  M-theory  on local
  seven-dimensional 
   manifolds  with    holonomy  group.   We have engineered  the  quiver models from
    manifolds,   as     quotients of eight-dimensional  toric HK   manifolds.  The corresponding quiver models have been obtained  using a reformulation of the method of  webs. Our main results may be summarized as follows:

(i) Using  two-dimensional   sigma-models  with  gauge symmetry and  hypermultiplets,  we have constructed a special kind of    manifolds. The    latter  are      
  quotients of eight-dimensional  toric  (HK)  manifolds,  
. We have  shown  that these seven-dimensional   manifolds,  in general,   
are given by  real cones on    bundles over    complex  two-dimensional   toric varieties
.
 Explicit  models  have been given  in terms  of   sigma model  realizations  of  . 

(ii)  We have  discussed  the link between  the physics content of M-theory on such  manifolds and the method of   webs.    We have  reconsidered  and    reformulated  the method of   the   webs  using the toric geometry  Mori vectors of   and brane charge constraint 
 equations. For the  weighted projective space ,  we have  found  that the corresponding  field model  has 
 as gauge symmetry group. This is 
required by the anomaly cancellation condition.
