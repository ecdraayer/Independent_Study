  The modular invariance of the one-loop partition function of the closed bosonic string in four dimensions in the 
presence of general time independent exact pp-wave background is studied.  In the absence of an axion field the 
partition function is found to be modular invariant.  In the presence of an axion field modular invariace 
is broken. This can be attributed to the light-cone gauge which breaks the symmetry in the -, -directions.
Introduction 

It has been known for some time that there are certain solutions to the vacuum Einstein equations in 
four dimensions, 
with a covariantly constant null Killing vector, that 
can be interpreted as plane fronted gravitational waves, the so called pp-waves.  These are of the form 
ds^2=-dX^+dX^-+ _i=1 ^2 (dX_i)^2+F(X^+,X_i)(dX^+) ^2
where .  It was shown in that pp-waves are exact solutions of the spacetime 
string equations 
to all orders of perturbation theory.  So if this metric is used as a spacetime metric in string theory, 
the -function is zero, so conformal invariance is preserved.  
This class of solutions can be extended by the introduction of an antisymmetric tensor and a dilaton field 
so that the -function remains zero
. The axion field strength corresponding to the antisymmetric tensor is given by
H_ =A_ij (X^+)l_[  _ X_i _] X_j

where  is the null Killing vector. The metric, axion and dilaton have to satisfy the 
equation
_T^2F + 1 18 A_ij A^ij + 2^" =0
for the -function of the theory to be zero.
The action corresponding to the above exact solution of the spacetime string equations is 
S=1 2 ddt (h^ab  _a X^+ _b X^- - h^ab  _a X_i _b X_i
-h^ab F _a X^+ _b X^+ -1 3  A_ij  X_j _a X^+ _b X_i ^ab  )
where ,  and . Note that . This 
action as it stands is not quadratic in the string coordinates so it is difficult to manipulate. For a particular 
class of pp-waves, the exact plane waves, it turns out that by choosing the light-cone gauge it is possible to make 
this action quadratic and hence quantize it. Interestingly enough the transverse string coordinates become massive 
bosonic fields. Nevertheless the conformal invariance is manifested in the partition function. The modular invariance 
of the partition function for the Nappi-Witten model has been investigated in.  
This paper is organised as follows. In section one the canonical momenta are used to write the phase-space 
action before fixing the light-cone gauge. From this we read off the phase-space Hamiltonian in the light-cone gauge. 
Next we specialize to time-independent exact plane waves. The transverse string coordinates and the canonical 
momenta are decomposed into oscillator modes. Finally each oscillator Hamiltonian is diagonalized through a canonical 
transformation. In section two the partition function for  is computed in the path integral formalism following 
a deformed zeta function regularization scheme. This partition function is explicitly modular invariant, although it does 
not split into a finite sum of holomorphic times antiholomorphic blocks in any obvious way. In section three the axion 
field is interpreted as an  worldsheet gauge field in the -direction. This is shown to break the modular 
invariance due to inequivalence of the  and  directions in the worldsheet, 
for which the light-cone gauge is responsible. The modular invariance is only 
recovered after an integration over the twists.         

Quantization 

The canonical momenta corresponding to the action 4  are
P _+ &=& L X ^- = 1 2  h^a0 _a X^+ 

P _- &=& L X ^+ = 1 2  
(h^a0  _a X^- -2FP ^+ + 1 3  A_ij X_j X_i^' ) 

P _i &=& L X_i = - 1 2  
(2 h^a0 _a X_i + 1 3  A_ij  X_j X^+ '  ). 
Substituting in the action we get
S &=& 1 2 ddt [ 2P _+ X ^- 
+ 2P _- X ^+ + 2P _i X _i
+ h^01  h^00  (2P _+ X^- '  + 2P _- X^+ '  
+ 2P _i X_i^'  ) 

&-& 1 h^00  (4^2 P _+ P _- + 4^2 F (P _+)^2 - ^2 (P _i)^2 + 
X^+ ' X^- '  - F (X^+ ' )^2 - (X_i^' )^2 ) 

&+& 1 h^00  (2 3 A_ij P _+ X_j X_i^'  + 2 6  A_ij  P _i X_j X^+ ' 
+ (1 6 A_ij X_j X^+ '  )^2  ) ]. 
In the conformal gauge  and  so we are left with the constraint 
P _+ X^- '  + P _- X^+ '  + P _i X_i^'  =0

and the action 
S &=& 1 2 ddt [ 2P _+ X ^- 
+ 2P _- X ^+ + 2P _i X _i 

&+& (4^2 P _+ P _- + 4^2 F (P _+)^2 - ^2 (P _i)^2 + 
X^+ ' X^- '  - F (X^+ ' )^2 - (X_i^' )^2 ) 

&-& (2 3 A_ij P _+ X_j X_i^'  + 2 6  A_ij  P _i X_j X^+ ' 
+ (1 6 A_ij X_j X^+ '  )^2  ) ]. 
From this we can read off the Hamiltonian in the light-cone gauge. Setting  we obtain  
H=d 2  [2p_+ P _- + ^2 (P _i)^2 + X_i ' X_i ' -F p_+^2 
-p_+ 3 A_ij X_i ' X_j ].
Note that  is unconstrained in the light-cone gauge since it disappears from the constraint equation 
7 .
Next we specialize to the time independent exact plane waves. For these we have 
F(X^+,X_i)=W_1 (X^2_1 -X^2_2)-2W_2 X_1 X_2 +  (X_1^2 +X_2^2).

Note that . Setting  the spacetime field equation 3  
demands that 
 =-1 36  A^2 - 1 2 
Substituting 10  into 9  we obtain
H &=& 1 2 d[ 2p_+ P _- + ^2 (P _i)^2 + X_i^2 '  

&-& p_+^2 ( W_1 (X^2_1 -X^2_2)-2W_2 X_1 X_2 - (1 36  A^2 + 1 2 )
(X_1^2 +X_2^2)) 

&-& p_+ 3 A (X_1 ' X_2 - X_2 ' X_1  ) ]. 
We proceed by expanding  and  in oscillator modes
X^i(, t) &=& 1 2  _n Z X_n^i (t) e^in  

P ^i (, t) &=& 1 2  _n Z P_n^i (t) e^in . 
Reality of ,  demands that , . 
This implies in particular that ,  are 
real. The commutation relations of the  in the operator formalism are given by 
[X ^i_n, P ^j_m]=i^ij _nm .
The Hamiltonian now becomes
H=2p_+p_- + H_0 + H_osc. 
where  is the average value of the momentum density ,  
H_0=1 2  (P^i_0)^2 - 1 2  p_+^2 W_1 ((X^1_0)^2 - (X^2_0)^2)
+p_+^2 W_2 X^1_0 X^2_0 + 1 2 p_+^2 (1 36  A^2 + 1 2 (X^i_0)^2 
and
H_osc.  &=& 1 2 _n Z -0  [ P^i_n^2 + n^2 X^i_n^2 
- p_+^2 W_1 (X^1_n^2 - X^2_n^2)+ p_+^2 W_2 (X^1_n X^2_-n + X^1_-n  X^2_n) 

&+& p_+^2 (1 36  A^2 + 1 2 
X^i_n^2 - in p_+ 3 A (X^1_n X^2_-n  - X^1_-n X^2_n) ]. 
If we define_1 &=& p_+^2 (-W_1 + A^2 36 + 2  ) 

_2 &=& p_+^2 (W_1 + A^2 36 + 2  ) 

&=& W_2 p_+^2 

&=& 1 3  p_+ A
we have
H_0 &=& 1 2  (P^i_0)^2 + 1 2  
( X^1_0 X^2_0 )
(  _1 & & _2   )
(   ) 

H_osc.  &=& 1 2  _n Z-0  [ P^i_n^2 +n^2 X^i_n^2 + 
(X^1  _n  X^2  _n )
(  _1 & (+ in) (-in) & _2   )
(   ) ].
It is possible to transform canonically the phase-space variables so as to diagonalize the Hamiltonian. Let 
X ^i_n = M^ _ij X^j_n P ^i_n = M_ij P^j_n 

where
(M_ij )=i ^2 + n^2 ^2  (   _- e^i & _+ _+ & -_- e^-i   ),

_  &=& 1 G_ ^2 + ^2 + n^2 ^2   

G_  &=& (_1 -_2 2 ) + 
(_1 -_2 2 )^2 + ^2 + n^2 ^2  
and . The diagonalized Hamiltonians become
H_0 &=& 1 2  (P ^i_0)^2 + 
1 2  ( S_0,+ ^2 (X ^1_0)^2 + S_0,- ^2 (X ^2_0)^2 )  

H_osc.  &=& 1 2  _n Z- 0  [ P ^i_n^2 + n^2 X ^i_n^2 +
 S_n,+ ^2 X ^1_n^2 + S_n,- ^2 X ^2_n^2 ] 

&=& _n > 0 i=1,2   H^i_n  
where 
H^i_n=P ^i_n P ^i_-n  + (^i_n)^2 X ^i_n X ^i_-n ,  
S_n,  ^2= (_1 +_2 2 ) 
(_1 - _2 2 )^2 + ^2 + n^2 ^2  
and . Here we have assumed that the gravitational wave amplitudes are small 
compared to  so as to 
have positivity of . In case the gravitational waves have large amplitudes then the average number of
excitation modes of the string diverges exponentially and a string singularity appears. 



Partition Function when  
In the particular case of  we have , 
,  and , so 

 becomes independent of . Time independence of 
, ,  demands that the dilaton is at most quadratic in ,  and 
that ,  are independent of . So we have 
S_ ^2= p^2_+ (c_1  W_1^2 + W_2^2   )= p^2_+ S ^2_ .
The partition function now becomes
Z _A=0 =_F   dd  _2 Z_A=0 (,  ) 
where 
Z_A=0 (,  )= C dp_+ dp_- Tr(e^-2i_2 H e^2i_1   ), 
 
 is the momentum operator of the string, 
 is the Hamiltonian and  is the fundamental 
domain of the modular transformations. Substituting the above operators in 24  
and using the results of appendix A we get, in Euclidean time, that
Z_A=0 (,  )&=& C dp_+ dp_- e^-2_2 p_+ p_-  _i=1 ^2 ( Z^i_0 _n>0 Z^i_n )


&=& C dp_+ dp_- e^-2_2 p_+ p_-  _i=1 ^2 ( det^-1 2  (D^i_0) _n>0  det^-1 (D^i_n)
) 

&=& C dp_+ dp_- e^-2_2 p_+ p_-  _i=1 ^2 _n Z  det^-1 2  (D^i_n)
 

where  for  are given in appendix A. Using now the determinant formulae derived in appendix B we have
_n Z det (D^i_n) = _n Z  e^2^i_n _2  (1-e^-2^i_n _2 + 2in _1 )
(1-e^-2^i_n _2 - 2in _1 ) 
= e^4_2 _i  f_i^2 (,  ) 

_(1,2) =_p_+S _(+,-)   = 1 2 _n Z  ^i _n = 1 2  
_n Z  n^2 + p_+^2 S _(+,-) ^2 =
-1 2^2  _n=1 ^  _0 ^  ds e^-n^2 s - p^2_+ S ^2_(+, -)  ^2 s   
and 
f_i(,  )=_n Z  (1-e^-2^i_n _2 + 2in _1 ).
Note that in formula 27  we have regularized the sum by analytically continuing the formula
_n=1 ^  1 (n^2 + c^2)^  = -1 2c^2   +   2c^2-1 () 
[ (-1 2 )+4_n=1 ^  (n c)^- 1 2   K_- 1/2 (2nc)]   

to  and dropping the infinite uniform vacuum energy 
. 
We also make use of the fact thatK_-1 (z)=1 z  _0 ^ e^-t-z^2 4t  dt.
This regularized  is the Casimir energy of the theory. 
The regularization procedure we followed corresponds to a deformed zeta function regularization. 
Using the notation of deformed modular forms as defined
in appendix C we have  so 
Z_A=0 (, ) = 
C dp_+ dp_- e^-2_2 p_+ p_-  [  _p_+ S _+ (,  )
  _p_+ S _- (,  ) ]^-1 . 

The function  has the modular properties 
 
 _c (+1,  +1) &=&   _c (,  )  

 _c (-1  , -1   ) &=&   _c/ (,  )

and in the limit  it degenerates according to
 _0^R (,  ) = () () .
Here the symbol  means that we have regularized  by dropping a zero 
factor in the limit . 
Because 
of the modular properties 32  and the fact we integrate over ,  we have that the partition function 
transforms according to
Z_A=0 (+1,   +1)=Z_A=0 (,  ) 
Z_A=0 (-1  , -1   )= ^2 Z_A=0 (,  ) 
so  is modular invariant. It should be mentioned that in order 
to avoid infinities coming from the momenta integration a UV regularization is needed.


The partition function when  

When  the above calculation does not lead to a modular invariant partition function. This is because 
 assumes the role of a worldsheet  gauge field in the -direction. It is possible to write the 
light-cone gauge fixed Hamiltonian
12  in the following form
H &=& 2p_+ p_- +1 2 d[ 2p_+ P _- 
+ ^2 (P _i)^2 + (D_ X_i)^2 

&-& p_+^2 ( W_1 (X^2_1 -X^2_2)-2W_2 X_1 X_2 - 1 2 (X_1^2 +X_2^2)) ] 
  
where . This suggests that 
 is an  connection along the -direction. 
It is more convenient to define a complex spacetime coordinate 
to turn the  connection to a  connection.  If  then the Hamiltonian takes the form 
H = 2p_+ p_- + 1 2 d[ (2)^2 P_z P_z  
- p_+^2 2 W Z^2 -p_+^2 2 W Z ^2
+ p_+^2 2 Z  + D_ Z D_ Z ] 
where now  and . 
If we make the gauge transformation 
Z=e^-ip_+ A 6   Z 
then the Hamiltonian becomes 
H = 2p_+ p_- + 1 2  d[ (2)^2 P_z   P_z   - 
p_+^2 2 W e^-ip_+ A 3   Z ^2 
-p_+^2 2 W  e^ip_+ A 3   Z  ^2 
+ p_+^2 2 Z Z   + _  Z  
_ Z  ]. 
The boundary condition satisfied by the gauged transformed variable  is
Z  (+ 2, t)= e^i 3 p_+ A Z (, t).
Expanding the fields 
Z (, t) &=& 1 2   _n Z  Z_n(t) e^i(n + p_+ A 6 )  

P_Z  (,t) &=& 1 22   _n Z  P^Z _n(t) e^i(n + p_+ A 6 ) 
we get the Hamiltonian
H  =2p_+p_-+ 1 2  _n Z  [ P_n^ZP_n^Z  -p_+^2 2 WZ_nZ_-n -
p_+^2 2 W Z _nZ _-n +p_+^2 2 Z _n+(n+p_+A 6 )^2Z_nZ _n].
This is the same Hamiltonian as 14  when  with the only difference that the term  
is replaced by the term .  
Also note that the momentum operator  that appears in appendix A changes to 
 _n=i(n+p_+A 6 ) ( Z _n P ^Z_n  - Z _-n  P ^Z  _n ).
This momentum operator generates  translations in , . This means that it 
generates covariant  translations on , .   
Again the only difference is that  has been replaced by .  
So the partition function becomes
Z_A(,  )=Cdp_+dp_-e^-2_2p_+p_- _i=1 ^2_nZ 
det^-1 2  (D^i_(n+p_+A 6 ) ).
The product of determinants has been computed in appendix B so if we define 
 ^(1,2) _n+ p_+ A 6  =(n+p_+ A 6 )^2 + p_+^2 S^2_(+,-)   
we have 
&&_n Z det (D^i_(n+p_+A 6 ) ) = _n Z  e^2 ^i_(n+p_+A/6)  _2 
(1-e^-2 ^i_(n+p_+A/6)  _2 + 2i(n+p_+A 6 ) _1 ) 

&&(1-e^-2 ^i_(n+p_+A/6)  _2 - 2i(n+p_+A 6 ) _1 ) 
= e^4_2 _i(p_+ A 6 )  f_i[p_+ A 6 ] (,  ) f_i[-p_+ A 6 ] (,  ) 
where
^(1,2) _p_+ A 6  &=& _p_+ A 6  (p_+ S_(+,-) ) = 
1 2 _n Z  (n+p_+ A 6 )^2 + p^2_+ S ^2_(+,-)   
 
&=&
-1 2^2 _n=1 ^ _0^  ds e^-n^2 s -p^2_+ S ^2_(+,-) ^2 s  
(p_+ A 3 n) 

f_i[p_+ A 6 ] (,  ) &=& _n Z  
(1-e^-2 ^i_(n+p_+A/6)  _2 + 2i(n+p_+A 6 ) _1 ). 
In terms of the deformed theta functions of appendix C the partition function becomes
Z_A(,  )=Cdp_+dp_-e^-2_2p_+p_- 
(   _p_+ S _+ [   ] (,  )   _p_+ S _- 
[   ] (,  )    _p_+ S _+ (,  )
  _p_+ S _- (,  )  )^-1 2  
This is not modular invariant since we only have twists in the -direction. The reason for this is the choice 
of the light-cone gauge. Consider the action 4  in the conformal gauge. This can be written in the form  
S &=& 1 2 ddt [ - _t  X^+ _t X^- + _  X^+ _  X^- 
+ (D_tX)_i (D_tX)_i - (D_ X)_i (D_ X)_i 
 
&+& F  _t X^+ _t X^+ - F  _  X^+ _  X^+ ] 
where 
(D_t X)_i &=& _t X_i - 1 6  A_ij (X^+) _ X^+ X_j 

(D_  X)_i &=& _  X_i - 1 6  A_ij (X^+) _t X^+ X_j 

F  &=& F + 1 36 A_ij (X^+)A_il (X^+) X_j X_l.
 
Note that 3  implies that  satisfies the equation
^2_T F + 2^" =0.
The action 47  implies that we also have a covariant derivative in the -direction. In the light-cone 
gauge  so the symmetry in the - and -directions is broken. This explains why 
the partition function we obtained is not modular invariant.    

Conclusion 

In the case  the partition function is explicitly modular invariant. Nevertheless it still needs to be regularized
in a way that does not break this invariance. 
In the case  the partition function is not modular invariant since we have a twist only in the -direction
which breaks the equivalence of the - and -directions. One way to recover modular invariance is to 
integrate over all the possible twists in both directions. However it seems necessary to develop a covariant 
quantization procedure to justify such an integration. Another way to 
obtain the modular invariant partition function is through equivalences that exist between the bosonic string in 
certain pp-wave backgrounds and Wess-Zumino-Witten models based on non-semisimple Lie groups of the type discussed in 
.  

Appendix A  

Let us consider the generators of  and  translations on the n-mode part of the field operator 
 
expansion,  for .  
In this appendix to simplify notation we omit 
the tilde from the  and the . The generator of  translations is just 
the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian  while the generator of  translations is

 ^i_n=in ( X ^i_n P ^i_-n  - X ^i_-n  P ^i_n ). 
It satisfies 
[ ^i_n,X ^j_m (t) e^im  + X ^j_-m  (t) e^-im ]
=-i^ij _nm   
(X ^i_n (t) e^in  + X ^i_-n  (t) e^-in  ).
We want to compute the partition function of the oscillators on the torus. To do this we propagate 
oscillator states from ,  to ,  along a path in the 
worldsheet which we discretize. Now we have

e^iP^i,j _-n  (X^i,j+1 _n  - X^i,j _n )  e^iP^i,j _n  (X^i,j+1 _-n  - X^i,j _-n ) 
e^- it H^i_n (P^i,j _n , X^i,j _n )  e^i
^i_n (P^i,j _n , X^i,j _n )  + quad.
Now, since the momentum and the Hamiltonian commute, the partition function is independent of the path by which 
we join ,  to ,  so we can take this path to be a straight line.
Hence we have that  so 
Z^i_n && <X^i,final _n, + 2_1, t+_2X^i,initial _n, , t -_2> 

&=& C _j dX^i,j _n  dX^i,j _-n dP^i,j _n  dP^i,j _-n  
e^iP^i,j _-n  (X^i,j+1 _n  - X^i,j _n )  e^iP^i,j _n  (X^i,j+1 _-n  - X^i,j _-n )  

&& e^- it H^i_n (P^i,j _n , X^i,j _n )  e^i _1 _2 t 
^i_n (P^i,j _n , X^i,j _n ) . 
In the continuum limit this becomes
Z^i_n = C DX^i _n  DX^i _-n DP^i _n  DP^i _-n  e^i(P^i_-n X ^i_n + P^i_n X ^i_-n 
-H^i_n (P^i _n , X^i _n )+ _1 _2  
^i_n (P^i _n , X^i _n ) )dt . 
Analytically continuing to imaginary time by letting ,  and 
performing the  integrations we get
Z^i_n &=& C DX^i_n DX^i_-n  e^-X^i_n (-d^2 dt^2 +2in_1 _2 d dt  + n^2 
_1^2 _2^2  + (^i_n)^2 ) X^i_-n  dt   

&=& C det^-1 (-d^2 dt^2 +2in_1 _2 d dt  + n^2 
_1^2 _2^2  + (^i_n)^2 ). 

For the zero mode  formula a10  is no longer valid because we do not have a complex pair of modes, 
but instead we have a real mode. Doing a similar calculation we get
Z^i_0 &=& C DX^i_0 e^-1 2 X^i_0 (-d^2 dt^2 + (^i_0)^2 ) X^i_0  dt   
= C det^-1 2  (-d^2 dt^2 + (^i_0)^2 ). 




 
Appendix B  

Consider now the operator
D_(n+a)  = -d^2 dt^2 +2i(n+a)_1 _2 d dt  + (n+a)^2 
_1^2 _2^2  +  ^2_(n+a)  
acting on periodic functions on . The basis of eigenfuctions is 
f_m(t)=e^imt _2  , mZ.

The corresponding eigenvalues are
_m ^n+  = (m-(n+a)_1 )^2 ^2_2 + ^2_(n+a) .
In computing the determinant of  we are going to use the zeta function regularization. This means that 
_n=- ^  =^2(0)+1 =1, 
_n=1 ^  n^ = e^-(2)^ 2   

and
_n=- ^ (n+)=_n=1 ^  (-n^2)(1-^2 n^2  )
=2i.
Now 
det(D_(n+a) ) &=& _m Z  ^n+ _m = _m Z  ^2_2  ^2_(n+a)  
+ (m-(n+a)_1)^2 ^2_2  

&=& _m Z  (m-(n+a)_1 -i _(n+a) _2 )(m-(n+a)_1 +i _(n+a) _2 ) 

&=& -4[((n+a)_1 + i _(n+a)  _2)]
[((n+a)_1 - i _(n+a)  _2)] 

&=&-e^2 _(n+a) _2 ( 1-e^-2 _(n+a) _2+2i(n+a)_1 )
( 1-e^-2 _(n+a) _2- 2i(n+a)_1 ).


Appendix C  

It is possible to define a deformed version of the product  where  
is the Jacobi -function in such a way that it transforms simply under modular transformations. Define
 _c(,  )= e^2_2 (c) _n Z 
(1- e^-2_2 n^2 + c^2  + 2in _1 )
where 
(c)=-1 2^2 _n=1 ^ _0 ^ ds e^-n^2 s - c^2 ^2 s  .
The modular properties satisfied by  are given by 
 
 _c (+1,  +1) &=&   _c (,  )  

 _c (-1  , -1   ) &=&   _c/ (,  ).

Note that in particular . When , , 
but it is possible to regularize it by dropping the factor that goes to zero. In this way we obtain 
 ^R_0 (,  )_c0  
 _c(,  ) (1-e^-2c _2 ) = () () .

It is also possible to define deformed -function bilinears. Define
 _c [   ] (,  )&=& 
e^2_2  _a+1 2  (c) 
_n Z (1-e^-2_2 n^2 +c^2  + 2in _1 ) 

&& (1-e^-2_2 (n+a+1/2)^2 +c^2  + 2i(n+a+1/2) _1 + 2i(b+1 2 ) ) 

&& (1-e^-2_2 (n+a+1/2)^2 +c^2  - 2i(n+a+1/2) _1 - 2i(b+1 2 ) )
   
where 
 _a (c)= -1 2^2  _n=1 ^ _0 ^  ds 
e^-n^2 s - c^2 ^2 s  (1+2(2a n)).
The modular transformations of the deformed -functions are given by
 _c [   ] (-1  , -1   )&=&
 _c    [   ] (,  ) 

 _c [   ] (+1,   +1)&=&
 _c  [   ] (,  ).
Again, when , 
, but it is possible to regularize it by dropping the factor that goes to zero. 
In this way we obtain  
 _0^R  [   ] (,  ) =
_c0   _c  [   ] (,  )  
1-e^-2c _2  .
One can easily prove that this regularized deformed -function is given by
 _0^R  [   ] (,  ) =
[   ] (0, )
[   ] (0, )   
where the -functions that appear on the righthand side of c8  are the usual theta functions with 
characteristics. It is worth mentioning that in this context the factor  that appears in the modular 
transformation properties of the usual -functions can be attributed to the necessary regularization when 
 since 
 _0^R  [   ] (-1  , -1   ) =
_c0  1-e^-2c  _2  1-e^-2c _2 ^2    
 _0^R  [   ] (,  ) =
 _0^R  [   ] (,  ).

Furthermore the deformed -functions have the following symmetry properties
 _c[   ] (,  )=
 _c[   ] (,  )=
 _c[   ] (,  )

and 
 _c[   ] (,  )=
 _c[   ] (,  ).
