Heterotic  supergravity on
 
sc:HetOrbi 

The low energy description of heterotic  string
theory consists of ten dimensional  supergravity coupled to the
super Yang-Mills gauge theory of this group. (For a textbook
introduction seegsw_2,pol_2 .)  The supergravity multiplet
contains the vielbein , the dilaton , the anti-symmetric
2-tensor , the left-handed gravitino ,  and the
right-handed dilatino . (Here  are ten dimensional
spacetime indices, and  is a corresponding tangent space index.)
The super Yang-Mills theory consists of a ten dimensional gauge field
 and a left-handed gaugino .  Their adjoint indices 
 correspond to the generators   and
are often repressed for notational simplicity. Here  represent the
generators of the Cartan subalgebra, and  the remaining
generators of  labeled by the root vectors . 
Their components are given by the structure constants in the
Cartan-Weyl basis: . We introduce the notation
,  
, and 
. 
Notice that this implies that . 
Furthermore we assume that the algebra is normalized such that
.


This theory can be compactified on an orbifold , which
is constructed as follows: The torus  is obtained
from the complex three plane, parameterized by complex coordinates
, by modding out the lattice ,
generated by the identifications  and 
. (For the definition of complex
coordinates and their conjugates, , , in
terms of real coordinates, see CmplxBss  in 
appendix sc:Spinor6D ).
Here  denote three real radii of the torus, and 
 are third roots of unity: 
. (The equivalence relation  means that 
.) The orbifold twist  acts component wise on the
coordinates of the torus  as 

( z_i)  = _i  z_i.
 
Modding out this twist defines the orbifold . 
From now on we make the convenient choice  
. Then these third roots of unity
are equal . (Notice that 
, where  is the
complex conjugate of .) This orbifold twist does
not act freely, and therefore results in orbifold fixed points. 
In each of the three complex tori we have three fixed points: 
 and 
. They are fixed points using shifts over
the lattice of the torus: 

 _0 = _0, 

_1 = _1 - 1, 

_2 = _2 - 1 - .
fixedpoints 
 
Collectively, the  fixed points are denoted by  

_s = _s_1 s_2 s_3  = 
( R_1 _s_1 , R_2 _s_2 , R_3 _s_3  ) 

with the integers . 


Since gauge fields are only defined up to group
transformations, the 1-form gauge potential  is not
necessarily invariant under the torus periodicities and the
orbifolding twist. This leads to the introduction of the Wilson lines
 () and the gauge shift vector  by 

cc 
A_1(z + ) = A_1(z +  ) = T_j A_1(z) T_j,
& T_j = e^2 i a_j^I H_I , 


A_1(z) = U A_1(z) U, 
& 
U = e^2i v^I H_I ,  
 
 
with  and 
.
Here,  and  denote the generators of
the torus lattice. The three vectors  have length 
and are mutually orthogonal. This is the Hosotani mechanism
Hosotani:1989bm  which  implements the Scherk-Schwarz boundary 
conditionsScherk:1979ta  for the gauge symmetries.
By combining these conditions with the relations fixedpoints ,
it is not hard to show, that the following four dimensional untwisted
states

R _s =  w     v_s^I w_I +   0 ,

survive the orbifold projection at fixed point . Here the local
shift vector  is introduced. The gauge group 
corresponding to  is denoted as . It is important to
note, that the local shift vectors  of all fixed points together
decide whether a consistent string model corresponding
to the gauge shift  and the Wilson lines  exists: Modular
invariance requires that the level matching conditions are satisfied

We close this subsection with a few words concerning the conventions,
we employ in the remainder of this work.  As
 is conjugated to  
, we may take the latter as
fundamental. (We will see in the next subsection that the  become  
the  supersymmetric partners of left-handed fermions in chiral
multiplets.) From the four dimensional point of view at fixed point
 the states  can 
be interpreted as scalar matter fields in the representation
. The representation  is with
respect to the holonomy group 
. (To be 
precise, the holonomy group of the blow up, the holonomy of the
orbifold is .)  Finally, unless otherwise
stated, expressions like  implicitly assume, that Einstein's
summation convention is employed. 






Effective four dimensional supersymmetry  
sc:4Dsusy  


The  orbifold twist is chosen such that only 
supersymmetry in four dimensions is preserved at the zero mode
level. The twist acts on a six dimensional internal spinor as 

:   __3_2_1  
e^ -i  ^i _i    __3_2_1 ,
 
where  represent the internal two dimensional
chiralities. (Conventions and properties of the six dimensional
spinors used in this work have been collected in appendix
sc:Spinor6D .) The components of the original 10-dimensional
supersymmetry parameter , corresponding to the supersymmetry 
which remains unbroken by the orbifolding, can be represented as   

_4  = _+++ _L - _-  _R, 
^C_-  = .
4Dsusy 
 
Here  is a Majorana spinor w.r.t. the four dimensional charge
conjugation matrix  and the subscript  refers to the
four dimensional chirality. This expression is obtained by
exploiting Majorana-Weyl condition of the supersymmetry parameter
 in ten dimensions (see
Expn10DF  of appendix sc:Spinor6D ). 
Notice, that this decomposition can be applied, even
if  is a function of both the four dimensional
Minkowski and orbifold coordinates,  and  respectively. 


Following the method of ref. Mirabelli:1998aj  we can decompose
the ten dimensional supersymmetry transformation in terms of the
unbroken four dimensional supersymmetry. Contrary to the five
dimensional situation under investigation in ref.
Mirabelli:1998aj , for the ten dimensional theory there
is no off-shell formulation available. However, by rewriting the ten
dimensional super Yang-Mills such that only the remaining four
dimensional supersymmetry is manifest, it becomes rather
straightforward to infer the  four dimensional off-shell
formulation of the theory. As we will see, this approach is particularly
useful to describe the interactions with the twisted states (see
section sc:InclTwisted ).  

A ten dimensional supersymmetry variation  of the gauge
field  and the gaugino  read 

A_M = 12 _10  _M , 

= - 14 F^MN  _MN  _10  + ,
 
where the dots represent terms of higher order in the 
fields(Notice
that we have absorbed a dilaton factor into the definition of the
gaugino as compared togsw_2 .
This means that the normalization of
the gauge field and the gaugino is the same; the modifications in the
supersymmetry transformation are higher order in the fermion fields.) , and the field strength is defined as 

i F_MN  = _M i A_N - _N i A_M + [ iA_M, iA_N ].
  
By substituting  given in 4Dsusy  and the
decomposition of the gaugino  Expn10DF  of appendix 
sc:Spinor6D , and 
using table tab:CmplxClifford  together with the multiplication rules 
BasicCliffordAction  of appendix sc:Spinor6D , 
we find the following four dimensional  supersymmetry transformations

Using the linear part of the supersymmetry variation of the fermion
the off-shell multiplet structure can be (re)constructed. For a

f_1  = 12 2 F_23 , & 
f_2  = 12 2 F_31 , & 
f_3  = 12 2 F_12 . 
 
BulkMultiplets 
 
As these are ordinary  off-shell multiplets in four dimensions,
the standard multiplet calculus, see for example 
VanProeyen:1983wk,Cremmer:1983en,deWit:1983tq , 
or superspace methodswundb , can be applied. This holds
true even though all these fields are still functions of the internal
dimensions. Alternatively, we could perform Fourier decompositions of
the internal dimensions, but then one has to keep track of many 
Kaluza-Klein towers. Of course, both approaches are equivalent, but
in order to avoid writing complicated sums and to be able to trace local
effects easily, we choose to work in coordinate space.  



Elements of the super Yang-Mills Action 
sc:EffSYM 

The ten dimensional Yang-Mills action takes the form 

L_YM  = - 14 F_MN  F^MN  = 
- 14 F_  F^  
- F_i  F^ _    
- 12 F_i j  F_  
- 12 F_i   F_j , 
DecompYM 
 
in the decomposition to four dimensions. (We have made
the simplifying assumption that the dilaton is constant.) It is instructive to
interpret this action from a four dimensional point of view. The first
term in this equation represents the four dimensional gauge field
Lagrangian. The second term gives the kinetic action for the four
dimensional scalars : 

- F_i  F^ _    = 
- D_A_i D^A_  - _i A__A^
+ _i A_D^A_+ _A_D^A_i,
  
with the covariant derivative 
. 
The second term in this expression corresponds to Kaluza-Klein masses
if one would choose to work in momentum space. The last two terms 
constitute the mixing between the massive Kaluza-Klein
excitations of  and . 
The final two terms in DecompYM  can be expressed as 

- 12 F_i j  F_  - 12 F_i   F_j 
= 
- 12 [A_i, A_] [A_j, A_] 
+ i (_i A_- _A_i) [A_j, A_]


- [A_i, A_j] [A_, A_] 
-i (_i A_j - _j A_i) [A_, A_] 
-i (_A_- _A_) [A_i, A_j] 
6DYMpre 

 
- _A_i _j A_+ 
12 _i A__j A_+ 
12 _A_j _A_i 
- 12 (_i A_j - _j A_i) (_A_- _A_). 

 
Here we have used the Jacobi identity to rewrite 
, and applied partial integrations to
the term  and its conjugate. 
(In ref. Witten:1985xb  it was first realized that by using the
Jacobi identity, the dimensional reduced heterotic theory could be
formulated as  supergravity in four dimensions.) Clearly
the first line resembles the structure of -terms in 
supersymmetry, while the second line takes the form of an -term
potential. To make this four dimensional off-shell structure explicit, 
we use the auxiliary fields ,  and , which were
introduced in
BulkMultiplets , and rewrite that part of the action as 

- 12 F_i j  F_  - 12 F_i   F_j 
= 
( 
f_i f_- 12 2 _ijk  f_F_   
- 12 2 _    f_i F_j k  ) 
+ 12 ^2 - i F_i  . 
6DYM 
 
In this work we do not attempt to obtain the full superpotential and 
potential of the heterotic theory, which is fully equivalent to the
original ten dimensional description. 


Finally we give some other parts of the super Yang-Mills action we need in
the calculation of tadpoles below. The gaugino Lagrangian is given by 

L_gaugino  = - 12 ^M D_M . 
 
This fermionic action can also be decomposed into four dimensional
fields. However, for the tadpole calculations we present
later, it is more convenient to keep the ten dimensional
structure manifest. 
As usual computations of loop corrections involving gauge fields,
require a gauge fixing prescription in order to be able to define
their propagators. All loop computations in this work are performed
using the ten dimensional Feynman gauge: 

L_g.f.  = - 12 (_M A^M)^2 = 
-12 (_A_)^2  + (_i A_)^2 
+ (_A_i)^2  

 
+ 2 (_A_) (_A_i + _i A_) 
+ 2 (_i A_) (_A_j).
  
The resulting ghost action is 

L_ghost  = _MD^M 
= _D^+ 
_i D_+ _D_i.
 
This completes our description of the ten dimensional gauge theory,
decomposed into an  four dimensional language. 




Twisted fixed point states 
sc:InclTwisted 


In addition to the requirement of modular invariance, which resulted in
the stringent conditions LevelMatching , string theory also
gives definite predictions of the states present at the orbifold fixed
points. These twisted states can be thought of as originally open
strings, which only become closed upon non-trivial orbifold twist
identifications. For the  orbifold this leads to the
following spectrum of chiral multiplets  

(1 _H, S _s: 
(w^I + v_s^I)^2 =    ), 

(3 _H, T _s: 
(w^I + v_s^I)^2 =    ), 
twistedmatter  
 
at fixed point . 

In the previous subsection the ten dimensional super Yang-Mills action
has been (partly) decomposed into four dimensional states. Only the
four dimensional  supersymmetry, which is preserved by the
orbifolding, was left manifest. 
This four dimensional  language was extended to an off-shell
formulation, involving the auxiliary fields ,  and 
as functions of the ten dimensional coordinates. Therefore, the
standard rules of  multiplet calculus 
can be used to obtain the action for the twisted chiral multiplets
, residing at fixed point  in the
representations twistedmatter , and their interactions with the
off-shell untwisted multiplets BulkMultiplets . For the
purpose of the tadpole calculations later, it is sufficient to give
only the scalar part of their action

+ 
) 
^6(z - _s - )  ^6 z  ^4 x.

The dots here may represent -term contributions linear in the
auxiliary fields ,  and their conjugates. We have
introduced the delta function on a fixed point of the orbifold, which
satisfies 

(z - ^-k z - ) = 127  _s ^6(z - _s - ), 

k = 1,2.

Models with anomalous 's 
sc:AnomModels  

In a previous publicationGmeiner:2002es  we have computed the
local anomalies at the fixed points of the orbifold . We
found that the anomaly at fixed point  was fully determined by
the local spectrum at this fixed point (given by LocReps  and
twistedmatter ), and hence ultimately by its local shift
vector . This naturally leads to the introduction of the concept
of fixed point equivalent 
models, which allows one to identify the local spectrum of this model 
at fixed point , with the spectrum of a pure orbifold model
(i.e. with no Wilson lines) with shift vector . The advantage of
this is, that only a few inequivalent pure  orbifold models
exist. Therefore, the investigation of local anomalies reduces to
the analysis of those pure orbifold models. 

The full four dimensional anomaly  at fixed point
, is given by the solution GenAnomaly  (c.f. appendix
sc:AnomPolyFact ) of the descent equation from the anomaly
polynomial 

I_6s  = 

327  R _s iF_2 
+ 3 T _s iF_2 
+ S _s iF_2 

A  [R_2] _6s ,
AnomPoly6pre 
 
where wedge products are implicitly understood. The subscript 
indicates that this formal expression is restricted to the 6-form
part, and refers to the anomaly at fixed point 
. This requires that both the field strength  of
 and the curvature 2-form 
are restricted to this fixed point. Here the Chern character
 is
computed in representation , and 
denotes the roof (Dirac) genus. (For an exposition of some useful
properties of (Chern) characters, see appendix sc:char .) 
We have used that pure gravitational anomalies can never arise in
four dimensions. The factor of  appears because the bulk fields  
constitute at a given fixed point of  only  part of
the usual anomaly.  

As was shown inGmeiner:2002es  using fixed point equivalent
models, the non-Abelian gauge anomalies always cancel. Therefore we
only need to  consider the possible Abelian anomalies (both pure and
mixed) more carefully. At a given fixed point  we may have at
most one anomalous . Its gauge field is denoted by ,
while the other gauge fields that exist at this fixed point are
collectively referred to as . Employing similar notation for
the corresponding field strengths, the anomaly polynomial becomes

Here we have utilized the symbolic short-hand notation 
 to
denote the local matter representations with their relevant
normalizations at fixed point . In addition, from the fixed
point model analysis it followed, that there are 
only two types of anomalous 's at a given fixed point

The spectra corresponding to the pure orbifold models have been

anomalous charges . Since  in the  model is

each representation. The one but last column gives the traces over the

comparing these two final columns, in the  model the generator
 of the  is traceless, and therefore anomaly free, only

The remainder of the appendix is composed as follows: in appendix 
 a number of useful features of characters are
reviewed. These properties are then used in
the subsequent subappendices to compute the quadratic traces
for the gauge groups that appear in the anomalous  models.


General properties of characters 
sc:char 

To relate traces of the field strength  in various
representations of different groups to each other, a convenient tool
is the Chern character 

ch _r  [ i F]_Ad   = 
_r   [ i F 2  ]_Ad  . 
 
Here  denotes the algebra in which the field strength 
lives, and  denotes the representation of this algebra over
which the trace is taken. From the definition of the character it
follows,  that the dimension of a representation is given by 




(Many useful properties of characters and indices are
collected in.) 
The following properties of the Chern character are very useful

ch _r _1 r _2 [ i F]_Ad   = 
ch _r _1 [ i F]_Ad   
ch _r _2 [ i F]_Ad  , 

ch _r _1 + r _2 [ i F]_Ad   = 
ch _r _1 [ i F]_Ad   + 
ch _r _2 [ i F]_Ad  .  
 
For example, the trace over the adjoint  
of  over the field strength squared, can be expressed as:

Ad _N + 1  = N  N  
_Ad _N  [ (i F)^2]_Ad   
= 2N _N   [ (i F)^2 ]_Ad  . 
TrAdSUN 
 
Next we obtain the characters for anti-symmetric representations 
obtained from a representation . We denote the th
totally anti-symmetric product of  by . (Of
course, we set  and .) 
Because the determinant, in the representation , is fully
anti-symmetric, we can define the generating function of the
characters of the anti-symmetric products  as 

_k=1 ^r  
x^k  [r ]_k iF 
=  _r   ( 1 + x e^iF  ) 
= G_r   (x, iF). 
 
The function  has the properties:

G_r  (x, iF) = _n1  (-)^n-1  n  x^n
r  n iF ,  

G^p_r   = . (  x  )^p 
G_r  (x, iF) _x=0  = 
(-)^p-1  (p-1)! r  p iF .
 
In the following we only need the first (non-trivial) characters 
of fully anti-symmetric representations  explicitly:

l 
[r ]_2 iF  = 
12 [ (r  iF )^2 - r  2iF  ], 


[r ]_3 iF  = 
13!  [ (r  iF )^3 
-3 r  iF  r  2iF 
+2 r  3iF 
 ], 


[r ]_4 iF  = 
14!  [ (r  iF )^4 
-6 (r  iF )^2 r  2iF 
+8 r  iF   r  3iF 
. 

 . 
+3 (r  2iF  )^2 
-3! r  4iF 
 ]. 
 
 
By substituting  these characters give the dimensions of the
representations: 

[r ]_2 = r -1 2  r , 

[r ]_3 = r ^2 - 3r  +2  3!  r ,

[r ]_4 = r ^3 - 6r ^2 +11r  -6  4!  r .
DimAntiSym 
 
Furthermore, for a simple Lie group the traces of  over these
anti-symmetric representations read 

c 
_[r ]_2  (iF)^2 = ( r  - 2) _r  (iF)^2, 

_[r ]_3  (iF)^2 = 
r ^2 - 5 r  + 6 2  
_r  (iF)^2, 


_[r ]_4  (iF)^2 = 
r ^3 - 9 r ^2   +26 r  - 24 6  
_r  (iF)^2.
 
 
It is important to note that these formulae can be applied for any
representation  not necessarily the fundamental one.

To be able to use the general formulae derived above, we identify these
representations as follows: , 
 and . (Using the
dimension formulae DimAntiSym  for the anti-symmetrized
representations these
identifications can be confirmed easily.) Moreover, for the quadratic
traces we find  

_56   (iF)^2 = 12 _8   (iF)^2, 

_133   (iF)^2 = 36 _8   (iF)^2.
  
(This confirms that the quadratic index of  equals .) We
conclude that  

160  _248  [(iF)^2]_7   = 
112  _56  [(iF)^2]_7  .  
 

 quadratic trace  

For the  factor in the first  the computation 
is more straightforward, since we only have to take the dimensions of 
the  representations and their charges into account. This gives 

160 _248  [(iF)^2]_1   = 
160  ( 2 56 (1)^2 + 2(2)^2 ) 
[(iF)^2]_1   = 2 [(iF)^2]_1  . 
 

 quadratic trace  

For the quadratic trace in the adjoint of  the relevant branching

, hence we find their traces can be expressed as 

_80   [(iF)^2]_9   = 18 _9   [(iF)^2]_9  ,

_84   [(iF)^2]_9   = 21  _9   [(iF)^2]_9  ,
 
in terms of the reference representation  of . This
confirms that the index of  is : 

160  _248  [(iF)^2]_9   =
160  ( 18 + 221 ) 
_9  [(iF)^2]_9  
= _9  [(iF)^2]_9  .
 

 quadratic trace 

Using the expression for the character of the spinor representation 
, given in, we find for the quadratic 
trace of the spinorial representation  of

_64   [(iF)^2]_14   = 
2^72^2-1 4 2!  B_2 _14   [(iF)^2]_14   =  
8 _14   [(iF)^2]_14  ,


_91   [(iF)^2]_14   = 12 _14   [(iF)^2]_14  ,
 
 
with the Bernoulli number: . For the second relation, we used 
that the adjoint of  is obtained as the anti-symmetric
representation . Following the branching
branchings   of  to  representations gives 

160 _248   [(iF)^2]_14   = 
160  ( 12 + 2 + 28 ) _14   [(iF)^2]_14  
= 12  _14   [(iF)^2]_14  .

Finally, we compute the quadratic traces of the  factor in the 
second  gauge group. As for the previous  factor, we
can use the charges given in the branching rules branchings 

160 _248   [(iF)^2]_1 '  = 
160  ( 2 14(2)^2

Introduction 
sc:intro  



The present paper is the follow up investigation of our recent work
 on localized anomalies in heterotic orbifold
models. Let us therefore briefly summarize the general context and the
main findings of that article. We considered the effective field
theory description of ten dimensional heterotic string theory compactified on
the six dimensional orbifold . Strings on orbifolds have been
discussed first by the authors of refs.
 and with the inclusion of non-trivial
gauge field backgrounds, so-called Wilson lines, in
. Recently there 
has been a strong effort to understand the shape of anomalies on 
orbifolds. First in ref.  the anomalies on 
 were computed and it was found that they localize
at the fixed points of this orbifold. Afterwards, various groups
computed anomalies on the orbifolds , 
 and 
.
These results, and the questions on anomaly cancellation in heterotic
orbifold models raised in, led us to
calculate the gaugino anomaly in ref. .
The following two observations form the main conclusions of that
investigation:  
 

First of all, the untwisted bulk gaugino states lead to localized
anomalies at the fixed points of . These anomalies are
entirely determined by the local spectra of those untwisted states, that
survive the orbifold projections at the corresponding fixed points. By taking 
the twisted states at the fixed points into account, we showed that
no non-Abelian anomalies arise at any of the fixed points. 

However, the structure of the localized anomalous 's turned out
to be more complicated. Using the fact that the spectrum of a model
with Wilson lines at each fixed point is equivalent to the spectrum
of a model without Wilson lines, it followed, that at most
one of essentially two types of anomalous 's can be present
locally at each fixed point. The sum of the local anomalous  generators
corresponds to the possible anomalous  generator of the zero
mode theory. If this sum vanishes, no anomalous  appears at the
zero mode level. 
 


The appearance of global anomalous 's in heterotic orbifold
compactifications has been
studied extensively in the past and we would like to remind the reader of
the most important results (see ref.  for details). 
In heterotic models at most one anomalous  exists at the zero
mode level. 
Gauge invariance is restored by a four dimensional
remnant of the Green-Schwarz mechanism, which 
leads to the coupling of the model independent axion to the 
anomalous Abelian gauge field 
. However, as observed in 
, the sum of the charges does not vanish for the
anomalous , and therefore a quadratically divergent
Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) tadpole arises at one-loop.
By direct calculationsof scalar masses it has been confirmed, that this tadpole
arises in string theory as well.(Similar tadpoles in open
string theory turn out to vanish.)  
However, in that case the string scale  provides the cut-off for
the quadratic divergence. In  supersymmetric field
theories in four dimensions, the Fayet-Iliopoulos D-term can either
lead to supersymmetry or gauge symmetry breaking. 
For heterotic orbifold models only the latter possibility seems to be
realized: the anomalous  is spontaneously broken; its gauge
field acquires a mass of the order of the string scale, which
effectively removes it from the low-energy spectrum.


With these introductory remarks in mind, we are now in the position to
formulate the central issues we wish to address in this work. 
Comparing the situation of the zero mode anomalous  in
heterotic orbifold models to the structure of localized 
anomalous 's at the orbifold fixed points, the
following questions naturally arise: 
 

How is local gauge invariance restored at the fixed points of ? 

What is the profile of the Fayet-Iliopoulos tadpoles over this orbifold?
What are the consequences of these tadpoles? 
As for the first question, we will show, that by a local version of the
four dimensional Green-Schwarz mechanism the local Abelian anomalies
are canceled at the various fixed points. 


The structure of Fayet-Iliopoulos tadpoles on orbifolds has received
a lot of attention recently. The existence of quadratically divergent
tadpoles on five dimensional supersymmetric orbifolds, like  and
, was realized in
 and the shapes of these tadpoles over such
orbifolds have been computed in refs.  
. These tadpoles 
of the even auxiliary field components of the five dimensional gauge
super multiplets  
possess both quadratically and logarithmically divergent parts. The latter
are proportional to the double derivative of the fixed point delta
functions. As noticed in ref. , at these branes
the auxiliary field of the four dimensional gauge multiplet is shifted
by the derivative of the odd real scalar of the gauge
multiplet. Therefore it has the same tadpole structure as the even 
auxilary field component. In refs. 
 it was shown,
that such localized tadpoles lead to peculiar shapes of the
corresponding real scalar background, which, in turn, often gives rise
to strong localization of bulk
states to one or both fixed points. This effect appears in particular
due to the double derivatives of the fixed point delta functions. 
For gauge theories in six dimensions compactified on two
dimensional orbifolds, like  and , tadpoles
were found for the internal part of the gauge field strength  
at the fixed points. 


With these results in mind, one can speculate on the properties of tadpoles
in heterotic models on . One complication is, that the ten
dimensional super Yang-Mills theory is only known on-shell. Therefore, 
one cannot directly identify the Fayet-Iliopoulos tadpoles. However,
with respect to the remaining  supersymmetry in four dimensions,
one may introduce the appropriate   
auxiliary fields by hand. In addition, as mentioned above, for the
anomalous 's one
may expect tadpoles of the internal gauge field strengths at the fixed
points. In this paper we introduce
such a four dimensional off-shell formulation, and explicitly compute
the tadpoles of the corresponding auxiliary components and the internal gauge
fields. The comparison of the results for these two types of tadpoles
provides an important cross check of our computations. Motivated by
the results in five dimensions, we also investigate some consequences of these
localized tadpoles.





Paper organization 

In section  we introduce the basic elements of
heterotic  theory on the orbifold 
with Wilson lines. We explain how the four dimensional 
supersymmetry, which survives the  orbifolding, can be
realized off-shell in the full ten dimensional theory. (The necessary
spinor algebra is reviewed in appendix .) This
off-shell formulation makes the coupling of the twisted string
multiplets at the fixed points straightforward. A review of the
possible fixed point equivalent models, that contain (anomalous)
's, concludes this section. 

Section  is devoted to the question how the
Green-Schwarz mechanism is realized on the orbifold, such that the local
Abelian anomalies are canceled at the fixed points. Important
factorization properties and trace relations needed to check that our
modifications of the Green-Schwarz action cancel these anomalies, are
provided in appendices  and ,
respectively.  

Section   is devoted to the computation of tadpoles. The
Fayet-Iliopoulos tadpoles, corresponding to the auxiliary 
fields introduced in subsection , are computed in 
subsection . (Properties of wave functions on the torus
 can be found in appendix ). To confirm these
results, we calculate the tadpoles for the internal gauge fields in
the following subsection. 

In section  we 
investigate the consequences of the modifications of the BPS
background equations. The question of spontaneous symmetry breaking is
addressed, and we show that the internal Cartan gauge fields in
general have non-trivial profiles over the orbifold . 

Finally, we conclude with a summary of the main results and give an
outlook on possible further research directions.

Decomposition of ten dimensional spinors 
sc:Spinor6D 

This appendix provides some useful properties of ten dimensional
spinors and their decomposition to a four dimensional Minkowski space
times an three dimensional complex internal manifold. (Details can be
found in.) To change from the six
dimensional real coordinates, , to the three
dimensional complex coordinates, ,  we use the 
following redefinitions  

x^2i+2  = x_2i+2   = 12   ( z_i +  _), 

x^2i+3  = x_2i+3  = -i 2   ( z_i -  _), 
CmplxBss 
 
and the induced transformations on covariant vectors. Here, we have
used that we work with a metric with the signature:  
. Hence for the six dimensional part of the
ten dimensional Clifford algebra we get 

c 
 ^2i+2  =  _2i+2  =  12   ( _i + _),


 ^2i+3  = _2i+3  = -i 2   ( _i - _), 
 

 _i, _ = 2 _i . 
 
For the decomposition of the ten dimensional supersymmetry transformations 
in section  it will be convenient to rewrite this
six dimensional internal Clifford algebra in terms of two dimensional
Clifford algebras. 

A convenient complex basis for the two dimensional  Clifford algebra
is defined by  

_+ = 0 & 2  
 0 & 0 , 

_- = 0 & 0 
 2 & 0 , 

_3 =  1 & 0 
 0 & -1 , 
_0 = 1 & 0 
 0 & 1 , 
 
where . It has the properties 

_3 _= - __3 = _, 
_^2 = 0, 

_+ _- = 2 _+ = 2 1 & 0 
 0 & 0 ,

_- _+ = 2 _- = 2 0 & 0 
 0 & 1 .
 
Let  with  form the basis of two dimensional
spinors, with the properties 

_0 ^= ^, 

_3  ^= ^,

_^= 2 ^, 

_^= 0,

By introducing the notation 




with , we can represent the six dimensional
Clifford algebra in complex coordinates (here and below the tensor
products are understood). 

The embedding of this six dimensional Clifford algebra
in the ten dimensional one can then be represented as   

_= _6 _,

_1 = _00+ ,

_2 = _0+3 ,

_3 = _+33 ,

 
_1  = _00- ,

&
_3  = _-33 ,
 
 
where  is the four dimensional chirality operator. The
(anti-symmetric) products of the six dimensional Clifford algebra
generators have been collected in  table . The
main advantage of this basis is that the action of the Clifford
algebra elements on the six dimensional spinors 
 can be worked out straightforwardly.

Tadpoles 
sc:Tadpoles  


In four dimensional  supersymmetric  gauge
theories coupled to chiral multiplets, one can show that the auxiliary
field of the gauge multiplet acquires a quadratically divergent
tadpole at one loop, which is proportional to the sum of charges 
. In section  we showed that also
the full ten dimensional super Yang-Mills theory can be cast in the
form of an  off-shell theory in four dimensions. Therefore, it
is natural to consider the possibility of tadpoles for the auxiliary
fields  introduced in section . These tadpoles are 
computed in the next subsection. Because of the supersymmetry structure
of the -term scalar potential in 6DYM , one would expect
that a tadpole for  arises if and only if there is also a tadpole 
for . Therefore (as a cross check) we compute 
all tadpoles for  in section . 


Before, we turn to the details of these tadpole calculations, we first
describe the basic technique to perform the loop calculation for the
bulk states on the orbifold . Obviously, it is much
more convenient to perform the whole computation on the torus .
To take the orbifolding into account we insert an explicit orbifold
projection operator that projects onto orbifold covariant
states. (This method has been applied for the related anomaly
calculation in ref. , see also ref.
 for a string computation of Fayet-Iliopoulos
tadpoles in type I models.) To explain the method, consider an operator
 that acts on a Hilbert space associated to a scalar field
 on the torus . Let  be an orthonormal basis for
this Hilbert space. For example, the basis TorusWave  defined in
appendix , can be used. However, it should be
stressed that our results are independent of the basis chosen for this
Hilbert space. The expectation value of  on the
torus reads  

(z) _T^6  = 
_q _q^(z)  (z)  _q(z). 
 
For the computation on the orbifold, it is essential that this scalar
 transforms covariantly under the orbifold twist: 



where the eigenvalue  is defined modulo . The
expectation value of the same operator on the orbifold is defined as 

(z) _T^6/_3  = 
13  _k ^-  k 
_q  ^(^-k  z)  (z) _q (z). 
OrbiProjc 
 
The part of this expression with  gives the same
contribution as the torus expectation value, up to the 
normalization factor . It is straightforward to extend this
procedure to other fields on the orbifold in more complicated
representations. In the tadpole calculations below we apply this
technique to the homogeneous twist components of the gauge fields,
gauginos and ghosts. Their symmetrization factors have been collected
in table . 

Before we turn to the explicit tadpole calculation, we make one
technical comment: All our integrals are taken over Euclidean momentum
space; i.e. the Wick rotation from Minkowskian momentum space has
been performed implicitly.

Fayet-Iliopoulos tadpole for  
sc:FItad 

In figure  we have given the possible tadpole diagrams
for .  We have employed the following notation for the 
 first diagram of figure , which has internal gauge
fields  in the loop (corresponding to the second term in the
second line of equation 6DYM ). The dotted lines refer to gauge
index contractions using the inverse Killing metric  
and a vertex of dotted lines refers to the structure 
coefficient . This means that loops of dotted lines
imply that we have to sum over all generators of . 
The solid lines refer to contractions of spacetime indices.  
Since  is described as a complex manifold, these solid lines
carry a complex orientation, which we indicate using open arrows. In
the second diagram of figure ,  
the fixed point twisted scalars  run around in the loop, see 
the interaction term in FixPointLagr . 


 









The following diagrams give rise to FI-tadpoles of . 
In the loop we have internal gauge fields , and fixed point
states .  
fig:FItadp 



Only auxiliary  with a Cartan gauge index
() can develop a tadpole: The propagators are diagonal in the gauge
indices, therefore, it is not possible
to form a closed tadpole diagram with a root index () on the
external line. Since both the Wilson lines and the orbifold twist 
are generated by the Cartan subalgebra, such tadpoles are allowed by
the boundary conditions of the heterotic orbifold theory. 


 
The diagram with the internal gauge fields (untwisted states) in the
loop gives rise to  

_Iun  =  
13  ^4 p (2)^4  
  _k, w, q,   ^-(, w)k    
_qw ^(^-k  z)  1 p^2 +    _qw (z) 
 f_Iw ^   w , 
 
where we have introduced the internal Laplacian 
. The case  does not
contribute, since it is proportional to the trace of the Cartan
generator  over the full adjoint of . 
For  we would like to rewrite the sum over mode functions 
as fixed point delta functions, using identity CombiWaves  
of appendix . Clearly, we are only able to do so, 
if the Laplacian acts on the product of the mode functions . 
This can be achieved with the help of DerProducts  of the same
appendix, and we obtain 

_Iun  =  
13  
  _k, s,w,   
    
^-(,w,s)k    f_Iw ^   w   
  ^4 p (2)^4  1 p^2 + 13   
127  (z - _s - ). 
subresultFI 
 
Here we have introduced the fixed point dependent symmetrization
factor  corresponding to the local
shift vector  at the fixed point . This can be rewritten
further, as a sum over the local representations 
 and  defined in
LocReps .  
Of course, the trace of  in the local adjoint 
vanishes, and hence will be dropped. Furthermore, we have
that   



 
We use the notation:  for 
 and , respectively. 
With these definitions the expression above becomes  

_Iun  =  
13  
_k, s,  
_R _s (H_I)
_r  = R _s, R _s   
^-(, r )k  
 
(-)^r  
 
 ^4 p (2)^4  1 p^2 + 13   
127  (z - _s - ). 
subresultFI2 
 
To evaluate this we need to compute the sum: 

_k=1,2  _r  = R _s, R _s 
^- (, r )k  (-)^r  
= 3(2 -  ^2  - ) = 9.
SymmSurf 
 
By Taylor expanding to first order in  , and performing
the resulting divergent integrals using the cut-off scheme, we find 
that the FI-parameter takes the form  

_Iun  =  _s
 3 _R _s (H_I)  
 ( 
^2 16 ^2  
+ ^2 16 ^2   
13 
) 
127   (z - _s - ),
 
where  denotes the cut-off scale.

The brane contributions are easier to obtain, as they are already
confined to the four dimensional orbifold planes. Their effect on the 
FI-parameter can be 
read of straightforwardly from FixPointLagr . As the complex
scalars  of fixed point  reside in the representations 
twistedmatter , their tadpole contribution reads 

_I tw  = _s ( _S _s+ 3 T _s )(H_I)  
^2 16 ^2    (z - _s - ). 
 
Combining these results, we find the expression for the 
full FI-term 

L_FI =-_I^I,_I  = _s
( 
^2 16 ^2   _L _s (H_I)
+ 
127  
^2 16 ^2   _R _s (H_I)
 
) 
(z - _s - ). 
FItadp 
 
The sign in this Fayet-Iliopoulos action is dictated by the Wick
rotation. 
Here we have again used the notation  which has been
introduced in eq. AnomPoly6 . The quadratically divergent part
of the FI-parameter  is proportional to precisely the same
trace which determines the localized anomalous 's, see
AnomPoly6 . The logarithmically divergent part of this
expression is proportional to the trace over the bulk states only. As
can be seen from the one but last column of table
, for all local  factors, not just the
anomalous ones, this logarithmically divergent part is present. 

It is not difficult to see that this expression reduces to the
well-known result at the zero mode level, by integrating out the
internal dimensions of the orbifold. In particular the second term,
with the Laplacian , then drops out. In fact, since we are
considering the low energy regime of a heterotic string model, the
cut-off  should be related to the string scale. The
calculation of the zero mode Fayet-Iliopoulos terms has been performed
in full heterotic string theory, see refs.
. From these calculations we infer that
 with  the string tension. 














Tadpoles of the internal gauge fields 
sec:TadpolesIntGauge 


This section is devoted to the computation of tadpoles of internal
gauge fields. As for the auxiliary fields, it is not possible to have
tadpole diagrams of internal gauge fields with non-Cartan indices. The
computation of tadpoles for  and  are completely
analogous and hence we focus on the tadpoles of  only. As the
contributions of the internal gauge fields  to the tadpoles 
of  are rather subtle, we discuss them first and in more detail.

Only three cubic terms in 6DYMpre  are relevant for scalar
contributions to the tadpole of . (The reason is, that for 
cubic terms with two  one cannot close the loop if 
represents an external leg.) In figure  we
have collected these three terms and drawn the corresponding
vertices.  In addition to the Feynman rules introduced in the previous
section, a solid arrow at the end of a solid line indicates
differentiation w.r.t. a holomorphic coordinate .  
Using these vertices one can draw four different diagrams which give
rise to tadpole contributions of . They are depicted in
figure . The first and the second tadpole diagrams
result from the first vertex given in figure . The
last two diagrams, both, have a multiplicity of two, since they 
can be obtained from the middle as well as the last vertex of figure
. The expressions for these tadpole diagrams are
given by

For diagrams  and  of fig. , 
we have to sum over
,  since all of the complex components of the internal gauge
field contribute. The last three diagrams of figure all have  derivative inside the loop. It is important to
realize, that only for diagram  the orientation of the
differentiation arrow and the complex index arrow are opposite. This
signifies, that the derivative is not hitting  but rather 
. As can be inferred from the first formula 
in DerProducts  of appendix , this implies
that this diagram picks up an additional factor .

In addition to these four dimensional scalar loop diagrams, we have
contributions from the four dimensional vector , the ten
dimensional gaugino  and the ghost . 
As the bulk theory is non-Abelian, the resulting ghost sector does
not decouple from the calculation.  In ten dimensional Feynman
gauge  the ghost has a ten dimensional propagator. In figure 
 these other tadpole diagrams are collected;  
their contributions read

Before we discuss the details of the evaluation of these tadpoles, we
first turn to the following cancellations, which are ultimately due to 
supersymmetry. Symbolically they may be represented as  

E + F_+++  + G 4 - 2 -2 = 0; 
D + F_(+-)  3*2 - 3 *2 = 0.

the internal gaugino chirality . Similarly,  refers to the
sum over the three cyclic permutations of the chirality indices 
of expression . We have used table  to 
conclude that the corresponding expressions are equal up to the given
multiplicities.  
This shows that we are left with the three diagrams
 and  (see figure ).  
From this point onwards it
is important to distinguish between the cases  and ;
we will denote the expressions for the corresponding diagrams with
subscripts. Let us first consider the remaining diagrams for .

: bulk tadpoles  



As can be inferred from the discussion below definition
OrbiProjc , the case  corresponds to the calculation on
the torus. It is not difficult to see that  vanishes: The sum is over
all positive and negative  and , by taking  and 
 the resulting expression remains the same, except that the structure
coefficients change sign: 
. But since the
summation indices  and  are dummy indices, this implies that 
. For  and  a similar
argument does not hold: Because of the extra derivative 
sandwiched between  and , those expressions
do not vanish. However, the expression for the tadpole can be represented as
a derivative w.r.t.   

B_k=0  + C_k=0  = - i A_^I  
 R_i  16 i  -  -1  
[]a_^I  
  1V_6  _q,w  ^4 p (2)^4  
[ p^2 + (2)^2  q_i + b_iw ^2/R_i^2  ]
f_Iw ^   w ,
 
where  is the volume of the torus and  is defined 
in Defb  of appendix . 
This completes the computation of the case . 
The interpretation of this tadpole is the following: Because we have
allowed for Wilson lines in the model, it is not surprising, that these
constant gauge backgrounds will receive quantum corrections. 
To see that this interpretation makes sense, we observe that if there
are no Wilson lines: . Hence, the whole expression
vanishes due to the derivatives  . 
Since our main interest in this paper is to investigate the new
counter terms at one loop, we will ignore this contribution from now on.  



: localized tadpoles  


For the case  similar methods can be employed as in the previous
section for the derivation of subresultFI . We need a
subsequent partial integration to put the single derivate   on
the external line of , which gives  

lcl 
A_k0  & = & _i A_^I(z)

(  i f_Iw ^   w )

B_k 0  & = & _i  A_^I(z)   
13  ^4 p (2)^4

 (  i f_Iw ^   w )  
 ^-(, w, s)k  
 ( ^k 1- ^k  ) , 


C_k 0   & = & _i A_^I(z)   
13  ^4 p (2)^4  
1 p^2 +       
 _k, w, s   
(z - _s -) 27   
( i f_Iw ^   w )  
^-(, w, s)k  
( 2 1- ^k  ). 
 
 
Here we encounter another, more subtle, cancellation: 
The sum of the contributions  and  is proportional to 

_k = 1,2  _r  = R _s, R _s  
 2 + ^k 1- ^k  ^- (, r )k  (-)^r  
= - _k = 1,2  _r  = R _s, R _s  
 ^- ((, r ) -1)k  (-)^r   = 0.
 
In the last step we have used that  
and . Therefore, the only
non-vanishing contribution for  comes from diagram A of
 figure .  As can be seen from the expression of
, the sum over the twist factors is the same as the one 
already computed in SymmSurf . Hence we obtain  

A_k 0  = 
_i A_^I  
_s 
3 i  _R _s (H_I)  
^4 p (2)^4  
1p^2+ 13    
127   (z - _s - ).
 
Again, we use the cut-off scheme to compute the divergent integrals. 
Clearly, the calculation of the tadpole of  is completely
analogous to the one just presented, except that in the whole calculation
. Therefore the two expressions are related by
Hermitian conjugation, and we obtain a relative minus sign. Hence the full
expression for the gauge field tadpoles on the orbifold takes the form:

L_tadp un  = 
-_s    
3  i  _R _s ( _i A_- _A_i )  
( 
^2 16 ^2  
+ ^2 16 ^2   
13 
) 
127   (z - _s - ).
full4Dtadp  
 
 

In addition to the contributions of the gauge multiplet in the
bulk, the twisted states at the fixed points supply us with an
additional source of a tadpole for , see FixPointLagr . 
As we discussed there, the inclusion of the
twisted states is performed most conveniently using a four dimensional
off-shell formulation. This results in the last tadpole diagram of
figure  in which the auxiliary field  is
exchanged; the tadpole for  due to twisted states, therefore, 
becomes 

L_tadp tw  =  
-_s 
i  _S _s + 3T _s (_i A_- _A_i)  
^2 16 ^2   (z - _s - ).
div4Dtw  
  
Hence the total expression for the tadpoles of  reads 

L_tadp  = -  i  (_i A^I_- _A^I _i )
_s [ 
_L _s (H_I)  
^2 16 ^2   + 
127  _R _s (H_I) 
^2 16 ^2    
] 
(z - _s - ).
div4Dtot  
  
This is precisely the expression for the localized tadpoles one would
expect on supersymmetry grounds from the tadpole for the auxiliary
field , as computed in FItadp . 
An additional cross check of the off-shell -tadpoles calculated 
in section 4.1, can be provided by a direct computation of the mass terms 
of . We will not present this in this paper.

Abstract 

We investigate the properties of localized anomalous 's in 
heterotic string theory on the orbifold . We argue that
the local
four dimensional and original ten dimensional Green-Schwarz
mechanisms can be implemented simultaneously, making the theory
manifestly gauge invariant everywhere, in the bulk and at the fixed
points. We compute the shape of the 
Fayet-Iliopoulos tadpoles, and cross check this
derivation for the four dimensional auxiliary fields by a direct
calculation of the tadpoles of the internal gauge fields. Finally we
study some 
resulting consequences for spontaneous symmetry breaking, and derive
the profile of the internal gauge field background over the orbifold.
