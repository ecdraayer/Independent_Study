We study exclusive scattering of 'hadrons' at high energy and
fixed angle in (nonconformal) noncommutative gauge theories. Via
gauge-string duality, we show that the noncommutativity renders
the scattering soft, leading to exponential suppression. The
result fits with the picture that, in noncommutative gauge theory,
fundamental parton contents constitute wee-partons only and
'hadrons' are made out of open Wilson lines.




In this Letter, we pose the question: "what are the
fundamental degrees of freedom in noncommutative gauge theory? "
and find an answer to it.  Study of noncommutative gauge theory
, motivated prominently
because the theory describes D-brane worldvolume dynamics under
B-field background in string theory, has brought us many
surprises. First, what one might counted as an ultraviolet (UV)
effect is sometimes transmuted to an infrared (IR) effect.
Diagrammatically, origin of this so-called UV-IR mixing
 is quite reminiscent of the channel duality between
open and closed strings. Second, the quantum dynamics is
describable entirely in terms of open Wilson lines(see also). The open Wilson linesare nonlocal, gauge-invariant operators, and behave as a dipole
under a strong magnetic field, analogous to fundamental strings.
Both features point to the possibility that partons in the
noncommutative gauge theory are not gluons but some extended
objects. We will attempt to answer the question posed by utilizing
the gauge-string duality, and by examining exclusive processes
such as high-energy, fixed-angle scattering.

For commutative gauge theory, Polchinski and Strassler
 recasted the fixed-angle scattering of glueballs
entirely in terms of gauge-string duality, and
have shown that the known power-like behaviorat high-energy regime is retractible. In terms of the gauge-string
duality, the glueball scattering in the gauge theory side is
described by the dilaton scattering in the bulk string theory
side. At high-energy, as the latter process is described by the
Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude, one might naively expect that the
scattering process is exponentially suppressed.

The above expectation turns out incorrect. By the
holography principle in anti-de Sitter space and the superposition
principle in quantum mechanics, the scattering amplitude in gauge
theory is given by a coherent sum of the string scattering
amplitude over the bulk location where the scattering takes place.
For this, because of the holographic UV-IR relation
 in the gauge-string duality, one finds that the
sum is dominated by the process taking place near the boundary.
Key feature here is that, because of the warp factor, the local
inertial momentum  is mapped to the conserved,
gauge theory momentum  via 
, so, for any value of
, one can locate a bulk position , where
 becomes , leading
to  contribution of the string amplitude. This
explains why the glueball scattering as deduced via the
gauge-string duality actually behaves power-like at high-energy,
and reveals point-like, hard parton nature of the fundamental
degrees of freedom in commutative gauge theory.

From the gauge theory viewpoint, one can portray the question
posed from a different angle: "is it possible to find a
field-theoretic  deformation of commutative gauge
theory so that low-energy dynamics remains unmodified but
high-energy parton content is dramatically modified?" The answer
is affirmatively yes, and is achieved by defining the theory on a
noncommutative space-time. Our result would be considered as a
direct  evidence for the assertion.










For  supersymmetric gauge theory with noncommutativity
on -plane turned on, the background fields in the dual
string theory is given by
 ds^2 &=& ^2_st  [ u^2 R^2   - dx_0^2 + dx_1^2 +
  1 1+  a^4 u^4   (dx_2^2 + dx_3^2 ) 
  + R^2 u^2   du^2 + R^2 d_5^2 ] 

  e^2   &=& g_st ^2 ( 1 + a^4 u^4
  )^-1 
    G_0123u  = 1 g_st  
  _u ( ^4_st  R^4  u^4 )
  (1 + a^4 u^4 )^-1 
  

  B_23 ^NS  &=& ^2_st   
  ^2 R^4  u^4 ( 1+ a^4 u^4
  )^-1 
    C_01 ^RR  = 1 g_st   ^2_st   
  a^4 u^4.
  
Here, the curvature radius is given by , where
 is related to the string coupling parameter and number of
colors by . The
parameter  sets the noncommutative scale. In
the coordinates adopted, the noncommutativity is denoted by
. As we are
interested primarily in studying how the noncommutativity affects
high-energy fixed-angle scattering processes, we will restrict the
kinematics so that the scattering takes place in the
noncommutative subspace. The momentum  in local
inertial coordinates and the conserved momentum  at the
holographic boundary are then related by the geometry
Eq.() as

 p _m =
e_m ^m   p _m   =
   _st   ( R^2 / u^2  +
 u^2 R^2 /   )^1/2  p _m .  
In the commutative regime, , and the
relation reduces to the same as in the conformal gauge theory
 
.

As such, for a high gauge-momentum , it was always
possible to find a region in the bulk, where the string-momentum
 is of order unity. On the other hand, in the
noncommutative regime, , and the
relation is given by 

.
 
 Thus, for a fixed string-momentum ,
 the gauge-momentum is inversely 
 proportional to , precisely the opposite to the commutative
 regime.

So, what makes the story so interesting for noncommutative gauge
theory is that, for the very high gauge-momentum , there is
no -region in the bulk where the inertial string-momentum
 can be made small enough
- the conversion factor in Eq.() is bounded below.
This will become the key reason why noncommutative gauge theory
behaves string-like at high energy. For the scattering at high
enough energy, one cannot adjust -location of the scattering
center so that  remains small. The local inertial
string-momentum  has to grow in proportion to
the gauge-momentum . Thus, up to a finite rescaling,
high-energy processes in gauge theory corresponds to high-energy
processes in string theory as well. We will see momentarily that
the string theory processes take place at the location 
. Notice that, at this location, the
proportionality factor in Eq.() beomces
independent  of the 't Hooft coupling parameter.

We now investigate the high-energy, fixed-angle limit of exclusive
 scalar glueball scattering, and compare the result with the one
for commutative gauge theory. In exclusive processes, in- and
out-states are created by gauge-invariant operators. In
noncommutative gauge theory, this requires adjoining the
leading-twist glueball operator  with open Wilson lines
. The simplest exclusive process would be the
elastic two-body scattering, and the scattering amplitude in gauge
theory is obtainable by convoluting the corresponding string
amplitude over the wave function of the bulk state, e.g. the
dilaton for scalar glueballs. Thus,

 A _NCYM (p ) = _0^u _S_5  _5
 g_(10)    A _string (p , _5)
_i=1 ^4 _i(p _i, u),
  
where  is the normalized wave-function
of the dilaton field in the bulk, and  is the volume
factor of the ten-dimensional space-time (in type IIB string
frame). From Eq.(), 


.

The string scattering process taking place in the bulk is
complicated as background fields - metric, dilaton, NS-NS 2-form,
and R-R 2- and 5-forms - are turned on. In particular,
contribution of the R-R field background is of the same order as
that of the NS-NS fields, since the former has strength of order
. With currently available methods, analytic
computation of string scattering amplitude in such situation is
impossible. Nevertheless, in the limit , the
background is reduced to the one with flat space-time, constant
dilaton, and vanishing NS-NS and R-R field strengths. Thus, at
leading-order in , the string scattering amplitude can be
approximated by the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude.

Consider a large  but fixed  gauge-momentum .
When converted into the inertial string-momentum 
, the conversion factor depends on the -coordinate. At the
minimum of the conversion factor, both  the mean-value and
the variance of the -coordinate is set by 
. Thus, by letting the noncommutativity 
 but 
, one can always find a situation that the scattering
process is pinned at a fixed -position and the wave function is
spread out typically only over the string scale .
In such a case, combined with the argument given in the previous
paragraph, we can adopt the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude, which
refers to the scattering process in a flat ten-dimensional
background, as the leading-order string scattering amplitude. We
recall that the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude is given by

 A _string (p  )= g_s^2 _st ^6   (-1 4  _st ^2 s  )
    (-1 4  _st ^2 t  )
    (-1 4  _st ^2 u  )
     (1+1 4  _st ^2 s  )
    (1+1 4  _st ^2 t  )
    (1+1 4  _st ^2 u  )  
   K_c,

where  is a kinematical factor. For high-energy and
fixed-angle scattering,  and
 with
 held fixed, and the string
scattering amplitude exhibits a soft behavior

 A _string (p ) g_s^2 _st ^6 (_st ^2 s )^3
^2 [ (f() 2 )]^-_st ^2 s  . 
Here, we have used the mass-shell condition
, and defined the scattering
angle  as 
and . The parametric
function 


is a positive-definite function of  in the entire range
.

What becomes modified dominantly by turning on the
noncommutativity is the normalized wave-function of the bulk
scalar field, . The wave-function was computed
already in, and is given by 




where  denotes the second kind of the Mathieu function,
 and  refers to so-called Floquet coefficient (which depends
 implicitly on the momentum ). For foregoing
 analysis, we have found it sufficient and more illuminating to
 understand asymptotic behavior of the normalized wave-function,
 . The wave function obeys the dilaton
 equation of motion: 
.
Fourier transforming with respect to , taking S-wave mode on
, and rescaling as 
, we recast the equation of motion into a form of
the Schro dinger equation:

-_u^2 (u, p ) + K ^2(u, p ) (u, p ) = 0 where  K ^2(u, p )
= ( R^4 p ^2 u^4  + 154  1 u^2  +
p  ^2 ).  
Classical turning point  of Eq.() is
determined by . At high-energy
limit  we are interested
in, it turns out the turning point is located at 
, and this is precisely the scale set by the
noncommutativity, as seen in Eq.(). Asymptotic form of
the wave function is obtainable via the WKB method. The result is

 (u, p )  
    .

Here,  is a momentum-dependent normalization constant,
 is defined as 
, and  refers to the Airy
function. In the high-energy limit, the coefficient function
 is approximated as 
. The normalization constant  is
determined by requiring that the wave-function obeys correctly
normalized commutation relations, and this results in the
condition: 
. As  in Eq.() is
exponentially damped for large  and rapidly oscillatory for
small , the normalization integral is dominated by the region
near . Evaluating the integral by the saddle-point
method, we determined  in terms of the coefficient
function  as 

.

It now remains to collect all parts and put them together.
Re-expressing all momentum dependence in terms of gauge-momentum
Eq.(), we obtain the string scattering amplitude
Eq.() in the high-energy limit as

 A _string  (p ) g_st ^2
 _st ^6 (s)^3 ^2  ( u_*^2 u^2 
  + u^2 u_*^2  )^3  [ ( f() 2 
   ) ]^- ( u_*^2 u^2 
  + u^2 u_*^2  ) s  .

With the above WKB results, the convolution integral
Eq.() is not doable analytically, so we shall evaluate it
via the saddle-point method. For large and small values of ,
the integrand in Eq.() is exponentially suppressed, as we
see from Eq.(). The suppression is dominantly due
to the string scattering amplitude Eq.(), and the
normalized dilaton wave function renders further, sub-leading
suppression at large . Thus, leading contribution to the
convolution integral Eq.() comes from the region around
the saddle-point . Near the saddle-point, the Airy function
yields  contribution. Consequently, we find that
exponentially soft behavior dominates the gauge theory amplitude
at high-energy:

A _NCYM (p )  (g_YM ^2 N)^1 2  N^2 
  (s)^3 ^2 [
e^f()  ]^-s  for  p  ,  
where subdominant terms are omitted. Notice that, in
Eq.(), dependence on the string scale 
is cancelled out while dependence on the gauge theory coupling
parameters is identical to the commutative counterpart
, as anticipated. As Eq.() refers to the
leading-order result at large noncommutativity, 
, naive commutative limit of Eq.() is
not permitted. Redoing the saddle-point analysis at finite
, however, one readily finds that Eq.()
interpolates smoothly to the commutative result of:
from Eq.(), the exponential suppression disappears, and
the pre-exponential part is replaced by a constant (up to
sub-leading corrections).

Eq.() is the main result of this Letter. What is most
remarkable of the result Eq.() is that, in
noncommutative gauge theory, the exclusive scattering amplitude is
extremely soft at high-energy, damped exponentially. In fact, the
scattering amplitude is the same as that of the string theory
except the role of the string scale  is now played
by the noncommutative scale . The stringy behavior
is pronounced most for the energy-momentum exceeding the value set
by the noncommutativity scale: 
.

According to the gauge-string duality, the dilaton scattering in
the string theory is described by the glueball scattering in the
gauge theory. In noncommutative gauge theory, it is known that the
interpolating operator of the glueball is not just 
but the one adjoined by the open Wilson line.
The size  of the open Wilson line grows linearly with the
center-of-mass momentum : 
. It then implies that, in noncommutative gauge theory, stringy
behavior of the partons are manifested by the open Wilson lines,
whose size grows larger at stronger noncommutativity: 
.

As such, 'hadrons' adjoined with such large open Wilson lines are
interpretable as a sort of 'closed string' modes emergent in
noncommutative gauge theory.

In, Gross et.al.  also reported soft behavior
of high-energy scattering in noncommutative gauge theory. There,
however, despite apparent similarity of the result with ours, the
exponential suppression bears no connection to the exponential
suppression in the dual string scattering amplitude. This is
because their exponential suppression originates from the
bulk-to-boundary propagator ( region of Eq.())
and was entirely within the supergravity approximation, under
which no stringy features would remain. In contrast, in our result
Eq.(), exponential suppression originates dominantly
from the full-fledged string scattering amplitude 
 (dilaton wave function served mainly to provide the
requisite kinematical parameters and coupling constant of the dual
gauge theory). We emphasize importance of string theoretic
computation in the bulk. Had we taken a supergravity approximation
and replaced Eq.() by the four-point dilaton
scattering amplitude, the result would come out glossly different
and incorrect at high-energy. For that reason, in our result,
correspondence of exponential suppression between the string
theory and the noncommutative gauge theory is exact.

Obviously, next task is to compute high-energy scattering
amplitude directly from the noncommutative gauge theory and to
confirm the stringy behavior for the scattering among four
'glueball' operators involving open Wilson lines. In
, such processes were studied, but exclusively
at leading order at weak coupling regime. An interesting issue for
future study is to establish a suitable interpolation from weak to
strong coupling regime, and relate to our result.

We showed explicitly, in terms of gauge-string duality, how
'closed string'-like behavior appears in noncommutative gauge
theory. Though, from purely field theoretical consideration, the
appearance of 'closed string' behavior in noncommutative field
theories is rather surprising, we have learned that exclusive
high-energy processes offers an ideal set-up for answering the
reason why via the gauge-string duality. A further hint may be
learned from the full-figured ten-dimensional geometry of D3-brane
before taking the near-horizon limit. The geometry is claimed
 to be dual to a UV-flow of the four-dimensional
 supersymmetric gauge theory once special irrelevant
operators are turned on. If, tentatively, the holographic boundary
is placed at asymptotic infinity (which is the ten-dimensional
flat space-time), one obtains the local inertial momentum 
 is related to the gauge theory momentum  as

, we see that the resulting relation is qualitatively
similar to Eq.(): if we take large 
,  is proportional to . This
means that closed string modes do survive, and the holographic
theory would behave precisely like IIB string theory in ten
dimensions.

Summarizing, we have demonstrated that noncommutative gauge theory
exhibits dramatically modified parton contents from commutative
counterparts. At energy-momentum transfer well below the
noncommutativity scale, both theories are indistinguishable. As
energy-momentum transfer is increased toward the noncommutativity
scale, both theories exhibit point-like, hard momentum-carrying
partons. At energy-momentum transfer well above the
noncommutativity scale, the two theories display dramatically
different parton contents - while commutative gauge theory
continue exhibiting partons carrying hard momentum, noncommutative
gauge theory begins to expose stringy constituents. Fundamental
constituents of the noncommutative gauge theory consist of wee
partons only.
