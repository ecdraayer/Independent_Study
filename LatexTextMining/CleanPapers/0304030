In this paper the Seiberg-Witten map for a time-dependent background
related to a null-brane orbifold is studied. The commutation
relations of the coordinates are linear, i.e. it is an example of the
Lie algebra type. The equivalence map between the Kontsevich star product for
this background and the Weyl-Moyal star product for a background with
constant noncommutativity parameter is also studied.

Introduction 

Recently there has been much interest in time-dependent backgrounds
.
One of the examples which has been studied is a null-brane orbifold
 of the four-dimensional
Minkowski space. In Sethi and Hashimoto
compute the noncommutativity parameter  for such a background, by
following the procedure introduced in to compute the
commutation relations of the space-time coordinates. The string derivation
of this is in.
It turns out that in this example  has a linear dependence on
the space-time coordinates, i.e. it defines an algebra of the Lie algebra type.
It is an interesting example, since it is an algebra with particularly
simple properties, for which one of the coordinates is central and the
higher commutators of any element vanish. This makes it possible to perform
many computations explicitly.

This paper is divided as follows. In section 2 the algebra 
is recalled and the corresponding Kontsevich star product,
which generalizes the Weyl-Moyal star product when  is not constant, 
is calculated by the Weyl quantization procedure.
In section 3 an equivalence map in the sense of deformation 
quantization of this star product with the Weyl-Moyal star product for a 
certain algebra with constant  is constructed. This is possible
because for the null-brane orbifold there is a coordinate transformation
 relating the two descriptions.
Finally, in the last section the Seiberg-Witten map, which expresses
a gauge theory defined on a noncommutative space-time in terms of a
corresponding commutative gauge theory, is computed for this background to
the lowest non-trivial orders in . It is verified that 
while there are no corrections due to the time-dependence of 
for the gauge parameter  to the first order in , there are to
the second order.
For the gauge field  there are time-dependent corrections already 
to the first non-trivial order in . In order to obtain these 
results the cohomological method discussed in is used.

The algebra and the star product 

In this paper the Seiberg-Witten map for the four-dimensional
noncommutative time-dependent background obtained in,
 by T-duality of a null-brane orbifoldis studied. 

The algebra  formed by the coordinates is generated by
 with relations
[x^i,x^j]=i  ^ij 
where , for , i.e. 
,
^xz =-^zx =R x^+, ^x^-z =-^zx^- =R x
and all the other components of  vanish. Here  is 
constant and the orbifold identifications are
x^+ &&x^+; x &&x+2 x^+; 

x^- && x^-+2 x+(2 )^2 x^+; z&& z+2 R . 
The algebra defined by (),() is of the Lie algebra
type, since the commutation relations of the coordinates are linear and the
Jacobi identity is satisfied.
Moreover, it is nilpotent (thus solvable), in the sense that the third
commutator of any four elements of  vanishes
[x^i,[x^j,[x^k,x^l]]]=0 x^i .
A further observation is that  is in the center of .
For these reasons it is a particular interesting example, because these
properties ensure that many computations can be actually carried out
explicitly.

As a first step, the explicit formula for the Kontsevich star product
 corresponding to this algebra is calculated, by using the Weyl
quantization procedure. 
The result, which will be derived below in ()-(), is
f g&=&f  exp( i 2  R x^+( 
_x    _z-  _z 
  _x)
+i 2  R x (  _x^- 
  _z-
  _z    _x^- ) . 
 

&&+. 1 12  R^2 x^+(  _x^-

-  _z    _z 
  _x^- -  _x^-  
  _z    _z
+  _z    _x^-  
  _z))  g. In order to compare this result with Kontsevich's formula explicitly, it can
be seen that to the second order in  () reduces to
f g&=&f  g+i 2  R x^+ ( _x f  _z g 
-_z f  _x g ) +i 2  R x (_x^-  f 
_z g -_z f  _x^- g  ) &&-1 8  R^2 (x^+)^2 ( ^2_x f  ^2_z g +^2_z f 
 ^2_x g -2 _x _z f  _x _z g ) &&-1 8  R^2 x^2 ( ^2_x^-  f  ^2_z g 
+^2_z f  ^2_x^-  g -2 _x^-  _z f  _x^-  _z g
)

&&+1 4  R^2 x^+ x (-_x^-  _x f  ^2_z g

+_z f _x^-  _z g)) +...       which coincides with Kontsevich' s expression to this order.
f g&=&f  g+i 2  ^ij  _i f _j g 

&&-1 8  ^ij  ^kl  _i _k f _j _l g
-1 12  ^ij  _j ^kl  (_i _k f _l g -
_k f _i _l g)+... The star product () is associative and the 
appearing in () satisfies the Jacobi identity^ij  _j ^kl +^kj  _j ^li +^lj  _j ^ik =0.
In this particular example the star product () can be computed by
simply applying the Weyl quantization procedure, following the
method of. Starting from the Fourier transform of a function
, with  commutative variables
f(k)=dx e^-i k_j x^j  f(x)
the Weyl operator associated to  is defined as
W(f)=dk e^i k_i x^i  f(k)
where the commutative variable  is replaced with .
In this way a particular ordering of the elements  is
picked, i.e. the most symmetric one. Moreover, if the product of two
such operators  is considered
W(f)W(g)=dk  dp e^i k_i x^i  e^i p_j x^j  f(k)
 g(p),
then the star product  can be constructed as the 
function corresponding to , i.e.
f g=dk  dp   e^i (k_j+p_j+g_j(k,p)) x^j  f(k)  
g(p) ,
where the expression of  is obtained through the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula for the product of two exponentials
e^A e^B=e^(A+B+[A,B]+1 12  [A-B,[A,B]]+...) 
applied to .

For the algebra  defined in () and () the triple
commutator of any four elements vanishes ().
Therefore in the formula () the contribution from the ellipses
vanishes and the result () for the star product is obtained.

The coordinate transformation and equivalence map 

For the example (), () an equivalence map to a background
with constant  is now constructed.
According to,, the same background
described by (),() can be described also
in terms of another algebra generated by the elements 
with commutation relations
[y^i,y^j]=i  ^ij 
where ,
^y z =-^z y =R
for  constant, and the other components of 
 vanish. 

The map  relating the two algebras is
 
The orbifold identification () in the new variables becomes
 
It can be noticed that the coordinate transformation ()
is not linear and that it is singular for .

According to Kontsevich's formality theorem, where  is
well-defined, the star products  and  corresponding
to  in () and  in () respectively
are equivalent up to the coordinate transformation .

This means that if the coordinate transformation () is applied to
the Weyl-Moyal product
f g= f e^i 2  R
( _y  
 _z - _z 
 _y  )  g
associated to , then the new star product
f g=f g-1 24 R^2 x^+ (_x^- f ^2_z
g+ ^2_z f _x^-  g+2 _z _x^-  f _z g+2 _z f 
_z _x^-  g)+...
has to be equivalent to  defined in ().

Notice that to obtain () the following relation
_y =x^+_x+x_x^- 
has been used, which follows from ().

Two star products are equivalent if there exists an equivalence map 
, i.e. a differential operator, such that
f g=R^-1  ( R(f) R(g)).
 and the star products are expanded in powers of 
R(f)=f+R^(1) (f)+R^(2) (f)+...
and
 
Here , ,  denote the contribution of order
 in .
Then () becomes
 
In this case the equivalence map to the fourth order in  is 
found to be
R^(1) (f)=0, && R^(2) (f)=-1 24  R^2 x^+ _x^- 
^2_z f=1 24  ^zx  _x ^x^-z  _x^- 
^2_z f, R^(3) (f)=0, && R^(4) (f)=1 1152  R^4 (x^+)^2 
^2_x^-  ^4_z f=(R^(2) )^2(f),
which suggests that the equivalence map is actually generated by the flow 
of , i.e.
R  f=e^-1 24  R^2 x^+ _x^-  ^2_z   f.
It can be seen that it is singular for .

The equivalence of the star product () to the Weyl-Moyal product
 is what guarantees that it is associative and hence that
the Jacobi identity () is satisfied. 

The Seiberg-Witten map 

The Seiberg-Witten (SW) map relating the commutative
and noncommutative gauge theories for the star product ()
is now derived. In order to achieve this, the covariant coordinates
X^i=x^i+A^i(x^j), i=1,,d
are introduced, according to and.
Here  is the space-time dimension, in this case .
The name covariant coordinates is justified by the observation that they
are required to transform like
X^i=i[X^i] i (X^i-X^i )
under an (infinitesimal) noncommutative gauge transformation 
with gauge parameter .
The gauge potential  in () is required to transform like
A^i=i [ x^i]+i [ A^i].
It is a non-trivial result that for the case of  in
(), which is linear, it is consistent
to identify 
in (), because it is possible to write
 for any , where
the Jacobi identity is used to verify the Leibniz rule, and the index of the
derivative is raised with .

The eqns. () and () guarantee that for a scalar field 
 transforming as  the following is true
(X^i )=i (X^i ).
It is necessary to introduce the covariant coordinates through the shift 
(), because, unlike for a commutative gauge theory, 
on a noncommutative space 

.

The gauge parameter  is required to transform under  as
 . The SW map is constructed by considering the noncommutative gauge potential 
 and the noncommutative gauge parameter
 as
functions of the commutative gauge potential , the commutative gauge
parameter  and their derivatives. 
The functional dependence is defined by the equations () and
().
Notice that throughout this section the convention is used, that 
quantities with capital letters such as ,  refer to the 
noncommutative theory, while quantities such as ,  with lower
case letters refer to the corresponding commutative theory.

In order to solve the equations () and (), a cohomological
method can be used, as it has been discussed in 
. Even if  in () is linear and 
not constant, in this case this technique still works. Here, the main
results of are briefly recalled.

The gauge parameter  is promoted to a ghost
field and  to a BRST operator, which satisfies
^2=0, [,_i]=0, (f_1 f_2)=(f_1) f_2 +(-1)^deg(f_1)  f_1 (f_2),
 where  gives the ghost number of the expression .

The noncommutative gauge parameter and gauge potential can be expanded in 
powers of :
(1) +, A^i=^ij  a_j +A^i ^(2) +In this formalism the index of the lowest order term of the gauge potential
is raised with , so that the first non-trivial order in the expansion
of  is the second.

The equations () for  and () for  become
 
where  and  collect all the terms of order  which
do not contain  and  respectively.
In order to solve () it is useful to introduce the new operator

 
.
which is nilpotent, obeys the same Super-Leibniz rule as , and
commutes with the covariant derivative 
D_i=  
.
With the notation , it can be seen that 
, .
It is not possible to invert the nilpotent operator  to solve
(), but, following, if an homotopy operator  
is introduced such that
K +K=1,
then for a quantity  such that 
the equation  is solved by  for any  such that
.

As in the case of constant  to construct , the first step is
to introduce the operator , which obeys the Super-Leibniz rule and satisfies
L  b_i=a_i, L  a_i=0,
then define , where  is a linear operator which when
acting on a monomial of total order  in  and  multiplies that 
monomial by . Both  and  do not act on , i.e.
 and .

The nilpotency of  implies the consistency condition for
 and 
M^(n) =0, U^i ^(n) =0.
There are no corrections to the first order term  of 
 due to the time-dependence of , because the Kontsevich star
product () does not contain terms in .
Therefore, to the first order the known expression
 is recovered.

However, there is a correction to the second order term. If 
is split in  with
 denoting the known terms (see e.g., 
,) which do not depend on derivatives
 of , and  denoting the
correction due to the fact that  is not constant, then
(2) =-1 4  ^ij  _j ^kl  ( 1 6  (
a_i,b_k,a_l+i[D_i a_k,b_l]-i[D_i b_k,a_l]). 
 

+. 1 9  ([[a_i,b_k],a_l]-[[a_i,a_k],b_l])) , which in this case becomes
(2) &=&1 4 R^2 x^+ ( 1 6  (
a_z,b_x^- ,a_z+i[D_z a_x^- ,b_z]-i[D_z b_x^- ,a_z])
. 

&&+1 9  ([[a_z,b_x^- ],a_z]-[[a_z,a_x^- ],b_z])
-1 6  (a_z,b_z,a_x^-  &&. +i[D_z a_z,b_x^- ]-i[D_z b_z,a_x^- ])
- 1 9  ([[a_z,b_z],a_x^- ]-[[a_z,a_z],b_x^- ])).
The expression () for  is determined by solving
the equation
(2) =M" ^(2)  -1 4  ^ij  _j ^kl  
([b_i,b_k,a_l]+1 3 iD_i b_k-[a_i,b_k],b_l) ,
since  can be also split in a part  which does not 
depend on derivatives of the noncommutativity parameter and a correction
 due to the fact that  is not constant and then the
two equations  and 
 can be solved separately.
In particular  satisfies the consistency condition () 
 by itself, therefore 
has to satisfy it by itself as well.
This is ensured by the Jacobi identity () for .
M" ^(2) =1 6  ^ij  _j ^kl (b_i b_k b_l
+ b_k b_l b_i+b_l b_i b_k)=0.
An analogous computation can be done for the gauge potential.
Splitting again 
in a part  which does not depend on  and in a part
 which does, then the result 
 is
recovered, with  the field strength. The lowest order 
correction due to the fact that  is time-dependent is found to be
A" ^i ^(2) =-1 4  ^kl  _l ^ij  a_k,a_j,
which in this case means
A" ^i ^(2) =

 
.
The result () can be obtained by applying the homotopy operator 
 to  and thus solving the equation
A" ^i ^(2) =U" ^i ^(2)  1 4  ^ij  _j ^kl  
b_k,a_l-^kl   _l ^ij b_k,a_j.
Again, the consistency condition 
is guaranteed by the Jacobi identity for .

Notice that the expressions () and () for 
and  are valid for a general non-abelian gauge group,
but they reduce to the known expressions given in in the case
of an abelian gauge theory.

For simplicity the correction to the next order of  due to the fact
that  is not constant is computed here only in the
abelian case, even though in principle it would be possible to solve
it even in the more general non-abelian case. The result is
A" ^i ^(3) &=&1 4 ( -4 3  ^ij  _j ^rs 
^kl  a_k a_r (_l a_s)_S . +^sj  _j ^ir  ^kl  a_k a_r 
(f_ls +2 3  (_l a_s)_S) &&. + ^rj  _j ^si  ^kl  a_r a_k (2 f_sl  -4 3  
(_l a_s)_S ))   

&& +1 12  ^ij   ^kl  _l ^rs  a_k a_s (5 f_jr 
-2 (_j a_r)_S)+1 6  ^kl   _l ^rs  _s ^ij 
a_k a_r a_j , where  is the symmetrized
derivative of the gauge potential and  is the 
abelian field strength. 
The expression () can be found by applying K to
U^i ^(3) =^ij  _j ^(2)  -
^kl   b_k,_l A^i ^(1)  -^kl   _k 
^(1) ,_l (^ij  a_j ) .
Again, the consistency condition  is verified because
of the Jacobi identity for . Moreover, it is necessary to apply the
constraints  and 
by hand, as explained in, in order to obtain ().

The results (), () and () 
for ,  and  respectively
are valid in the general case of a linear  which satisfies the
Jacobi identity.

Conclusions 

Time-dependent backgrounds have recently attracted much attention
in 
 string theory-. 
Although it can be difficult to
interpret singular time-dependent backgrounds in string perturbation theory
, here only the scaling limit at the level of the
corresponding noncommutative gauge theory is considered.

The results for the SW map in section 4 are a generalization to higher 
orders in  of the formula (105) in.
For an algebra related to (), (), the corresponding
noncommutative gauge theory and its relations to matrix theory are studied 
in.

The equivalence map in section 3 could be used in principle, where it is not
singular, i.e. outside , to map the results known for the
case of constant  to the case of the algebra (),
().
