In this note we show that a simple modification of
  supersymmetric quantum mechanics involving a
  mass term for half the fermions naturally leads to a derivation of
  the integral formula for the  genus, a quantity that interpolates
  between the Euler characteristic and arithmetic genus. We note that
  this modification naturally arises in the moduli space dynamics of
  monopoles or instantons in theories with 16 supercharges partially
  broken to 8 supercharges by mass terms.

SWAT- 

Index theory, as developed by Atiyah and Singer,  
has many important applications in theoretical physics. For the
physicist, many of the
mathematical complications of index theory can be avoided by following
Alvarez-Gaume (see also) 
and formulating it
in the context of a suitable supersymmetric quantum mechanical
system. The crucial idea is to find a supersymmetric quantum
mechanical system whose Witten index yields the topological index of
the elliptic complex in question.

On the other hand, there are situations in which supersymmetric
quantum mechanics arises naturally. The one we have in mind here, is
in the semi-classical quantization of solitons in field theory. In the
classical limit the dynamics can often be described in the terms of
motion on the moduli space of the soliton (the space of classical
solutions). Semi-classical effects are then described by quantum
mechanics on the moduli space. In a supersymmetric theory, soliton
solutions generally preserve half the supersymmetries of the parent
theory and these are inherited by the quantum mechanical system.

An example of this set up is in five-dimensional gauge theories which
have soliton solutions consisting of conventional instanton solutions
embedded in the four spatial dimensions. Semi-classical effects are
described by quantum mechanics on the moduli space of Yang-Mills
instantons of a given charge 
. If the parent theory has 16 supercharges ( in four
dimensions) then the quantum mechanical system is the one associated
to the de Rahm complex which usually admits 2 supercharges but since
 is hyper-Kahler this is enhanced to 8. On the other hand if
the parent theory has 8 supercharges ( in four dimensions) then
the quantum mechanical system is the one associated to the Dolbeault-or
equivalently, since  is hyper-Kahler, the Dirac-complex 
which usually admits 1 supercharge but, as above, this is enhanced to 4.
A similar application concerns the semi-classical
quantization of monopoles in the same theories in four dimensions. In
this case the same kind of quantum mechanical systems arise but now
associated to the monopole moduli space (see, for example,
). 

It is well known that the gauge theories with 16 supercharges can
be broken to one with 8 supercharges by adding suitable mass
terms. In four dimensions the mass deformed theory is sometimes called
the  theory. These mass terms induce terms in
the quantum mechanical system describing the soliton dynamics which
have the effect of breaking one half of the supersymmetries. This
suggests that the system with the supersymmetry-breaking terms will
somehow interpolate between the de Rahm complex and Dolbeault complex 
and, in particular, its Witten Index will interpolate between the
associated topological indices; that is the Euler characteristic  and
the arithmetic genus . In the applications to 
instanton-solitons 
in five-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theory the index is directly
relevant because it determines the instanton contributions to the
prepotential.  

Although the problem
was inspired by instanton solitons in five-dimensional gauge theory
(or monopoles in the associated four-dimensional theory)
we shall divorce our discussion from these particular examples because
there are additional complications in these cases. In particular, the
moduli spaces of instantons or monopoles are 
non-compact and this leads to subtleties
in defining the Witten Index. We shall work with a target space 
which is compact. In addition, in both the instanton and monopole examples,
VEVs for scalar fields in the parent theory lead to more complicated
quantum mechanical systems involving potentials induced by 
vector fields on the moduli
space, as one can see in the instanton case in and in the
monopole case in. This leads to an 
equivariant generalization of 
index theory and once again we shall avoid these complications in this
note.

Following Alvarez-Gaume, 
we start with the quantum mechanical system associated to the de Rahm
complex of a compact manifold . Let , , 
be local coordinates for  which become
one-dimensional fields  in the quantum mechanical system. 
Associated to these bosonic quantities, we have 2-component 
fermions , ,
which are Grassmann-valued fields. The basic Lagrangian that defines
the system is 
g_ X ^X ^+
    i 2 g_ ^_ ^_+
    i 2 g_ ^_^_ 
X ^^_+
    1 4 R_ ^_1^_1
^_2^_2 ,
 
where  is the metric on  and
 is the usual Riemann tensor associated to
the Levi-Civita connection . 

The quantization of the theory follows by imposing the following canonical
(anti-)commutation relations:

[X^,p^]=ig^  ,^_a,_b^=_ab g^  .
 
It is useful to define the super-covariant momentum 

_ ^_1^_2 .
 
The system is invariant under 2 supersymmetries generated by the supersymmetry
charges 

Q_.
 
It is important to realize that operator ordering here is
significant. The Hamiltonian is obtained by the anti-computation of
two super-charges:

Q_,Q_=2_  ,
 
yielding

2g _gg^ _ .
 

The Hilbert space of the model is realized in terms of a fermionic
Fock space, with creation operators and annihilation operators given
by the combinations

b^ =12 (^_1-i^_2) ,b^ =12 (^_1+i^_2) .
 
The states

f__1_p (X)b^_1 b^_p 0 
are in one-to-one correspondence with the de Rahm complex of ;
for instance, the above state corresponds to the -form

f__1_p (X)dX^_1 dX^_p  .
 
Under this correspondence the supercharges  are realized in
terms of the exterior derivative  and its adjoint :

Q_1=-i2 (d-d^) ,Q_2=12 (d+d^) .
 

We now suppose that  is a Kahler manifold for which  is the
Kahler metric. So  has a Kahler
form  that is closed. The Kahler metric  is Hermitian with
respect to the complex structure  and furthermore 
, for 2 arbitrary tangent vectors  and . 
Under these circumstances, it is well known that the quantum
mechanical system admits 2 additional supersymmetries generated by the
supercharges

Q'_.
 
Since  is a complex manifold we can choose (anti-)holomorphic
coordinates , , compatible with
the complex structure:  and 
. In this coordinate system, the Hilbert space can be built
on a fermionic Fock space for which 
 and  are the creation operators while
 and  are the annihilation operators. States
in the Hilbert space are naturally identified with elements of the
Dolbeault complex via the correspondence 

&_1^j_1 _1^j_p _2^k_1 _2^k_q 0
dz^j_1 dz^j_p dz^k_1 dz^k_q  . 

Since  is Kahler, we can add a kind of mass for one of the
species of fermions to the Lagrangian:

_m=-12 m
(_2,_2)+c=-12m^_2_ _2^+c
=-12m_2 (_2)^+c ,
 
where  is a parameter. In the application to instantons, such a
term was derived in the effective quantum mechanics on the moduli
space in. In the monopole application, such a term can be
extracted indirectly from, by choosing the
matter content of the  theory to transform in the adjoint
representation. In both cases  is the mass of the adjoint
hypermultiplet in the parent theory.

The term pert  is only invariant under half the original 
supersymmetries; namely those generated by  and , 
following from the fact that the Kahler form is
covariantly constant on a Kahler manifold. In pert ,  is a
constant that arises via a normal ordering prescription and its value 
is fixed as follows. In the canonical formalism, we require that
the term pert  leads to a modification of the Hamiltonian operator of
the normal-ordered form

,_m=12 m:_2 (_2)^: ,
 
in order that it annihilates the vacuum state . 
Notice in the language of the Dolbeault complex, , up
to the factor of , simply counts the anti-holomorphic
degree. Ensuring that pert  leads to perth , fixes

c=mn/2 .
 
With the mass term added, the supersymmetry algebra gains a central
charge:

Q_1^2=,Q_1^2 =,Q_1,Q'_1=0 ,
 
where it is immediately apparent-since  is unchanged-that 

.
 

The question is what does the modification do to the Witten Index of the
model? Since we have remarked that 
has a very simple action on the Dolbeault
complex-it simply counts the anti-holomorphic degree of a
form multiplied by -the Witten Index of the deformed
system will be given by

ind _W=_i,j (-1)^i+j b_i,j e^-m j  ,
 
where  are the Betti numbers of the Dolbeault complex with 
and  being the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic degrees,
respectively.

So the addition of the term pert  or perth , 
which breaks half the
supersymmetry, is to deform the index. When  we recover the Euler
characteristic. In the limit, , the index reduces to the
arithmetic or Todd genus . In fact the interpolating
quantity witi  is the -genus of Hirzebruch
_y=_i,j (-1)^iy^jb_i,j  ,y=-e^-m  .
 
Now we see how it can naturally be obtained from a deformed quantum
mechanical supersymmetric -model. Note that the -genus
has also been related to supersymmetric quantum mechanics in,
via a twisted of the boundary conditions on the fermions. Our
approach obtained by adding the deformation pert , motivated by 
the application to soliton dynamics, is different. In related work,
a geometric interpretation of the -genus has
been given for hyper-Kahler geometries in
. In particular, this is
relevant for the application of our results to soliton quantization
for which the relevant geometry is hyper-Kahler. 

It remains to derive the known 
integral expression for the -genus by
computing the partition function of the deformed quantum mechanical
system. The steps are a simple generalization of the standard
derivation of index densities of supersymmetric quantum mechanics.
As usual the Witten Index can be calculated by computing the Euclidean
functional integral with fields being periodic in . We define
 to be the period. The resulting functional integral expression is then 
independent of -apart from via the
combination -and may be readily evaluated in the limit
 (with fixed ). 
In this limit, constant configurations of  and
 
dominate the functional integral and one can integrate out the
fluctuations to Gaussian order. 
To this end we expand around constant configurations: 
 
X^x^+X^(t) ,^_^_+^_(t) .
 
We can now 
integrate out the fluctuations separately and this is greatly
facilitated by choosing at each 
 normal co-ordinates for which:

g_ (x)=_ +O (X^2) .


 
The Euclidean action then splits in two:

S=S_c+_0^dt _f .
 
The constant part is

S_c=-14R_ ^_1^_1^_2^_2
+12m^_2_ ^_2+12nm ,
 
where the final term arises from the normal-ordering constant in pert .
This expression implies that the fermions zero-modes  scale
like , while  do not scale with 
(remember that  is fixed). The fluctuation part is then 

_f=12 X^^B_ X^+1 2 ^^F_ ^+ ,
 
where the ellipsis represent non-Gaussian terms which only contribute
at a higher order in  and hence can be ignored. Using the fact
that in normal coordinates nc 

^_1_ (X)X^^_1
=12X^R_ (x)^_1^_1X^+ 
to leading order and up to total derivatives, the bosonic operator is

^B_ =-_ _t^2-
1 2 R_ ^_1^_1_t+ ,
  
to leading order in . The fermionic operator is matrix-valued:
 
^F_ =( )+ ,
 
to leading order in .

We can now integrate out the fluctuations  and ,
as well as the constant modes  keeping careful track of
the overall normalization of the functional integral. As usual we can
write the resulting integral over  and  as an
integral over differential forms by identifying
. Finally we have

ind _W=
(i2 )^n/2 e^-nm/2 _    det ^1/2 (R/2
(R/2-m/2 ) 
(R/2) ) ,
 
where  is the matrix-valued curvature 2-form. This can be written as 

  ind _W=_ _i=1 ^n/2 x_i(1+ye^-x_i ) 1-e^-x_i   ,
 
where  are the skew eigenvalues of  and
. This reproduces the integral form for the 
genus.
