The response of the one loop effective action for a gauge theory with local
couplings  under a local Weyl rescaling of the background metric
is calculated. Apart from terms which may be removed by local contributions to
the effective action the result is compatible with  symmetry acting on
. Two loop effects are also discussed.

Requiring that a renormalisable quantum field theory is extended to be finite
for local couplings, so that the usual coupling constants are arbitrary
functions of position, ensures that functional derivatives of the effective 
action with respect to the local couplings directly define finite correlation 
functions for all composite operators that appear in the basic lagrangian. In 
supersymmetric theories local couplings, which may be given by supergravity
backgrounds, are directly relevant in constructing low energy effective theories and 
also for understanding the interplay of various anomalies ,, . 
The use of local couplings also avoids the requirement in more conventional
treatments  of introducing additional local counterterms which are necessary for 
finiteness of composite operator correlation functions since they are
essentially included in the renormalised quantum action.
Further the usual renormalisation group equations can be extended to
equations corresponding to local Weyl rescalings of the metric. Imposing the
necessary integrability conditions has proved to
a convenient method for deriving non trivial relations amongst the  
and other functions that enter into the renormalisation of quantum field 
theories and the correlation functions of composite operators .
In two dimensions the necessary 
consistency relations involve identities which are equivalent, within
the allowed ambiguities, to the Zamolodchikov -theorem and in four
dimensions similar results are obtained which are sufficient to show
irreversibility of renormalisation group flow in the perturbative regime
where the associated metric on the space of couplings can be calculated
and shown to be positive (unlike in two dimensions there is no presently
known connection to a two point function with manifest positivity properties).
The resulting equations then reflect some of the fundamental aspects of
quantum field theories.

Previously  we calculated the various renormalisation quantities that
were necessary for a finite quantum field theory with local couplings
for general renormalisable theories in four dimensions at one and two loops.
In this note we extend these considerations to include the  coupling
which is of course present in a general four dimensional gauge theory. 
Assuming a Euclidean metric , and arbitrary local couplings
 the gauge invariant  Euclidean action has the usual form

S = 14   ^4x  ( 1g^2   F^ 
F_   - i   F^  (*F)_  ) , (*F)_ = 12  1  _ _ 
^ F_  ,
 
with  the usual field strength and we define

= 8 ^2   .
 
For calculational convenience we choose a gauge fixing term of the form

S_g.f.  = 12   ^4x  g^2  
^( 1g^2  A_) ^  (
1g^2  A_)  ,
 
and the associated ghost action is

S_gh  =  ^4x  1g^2   ^c 
D_  c  , D_c = _c + A_c  .
 
Adding  and  and expanding to quadratic order gives

S_quadratic  = 12   ^4x  
A^(_1 A) _ ,
 
where, using form notationThus  is the exterior derivative with
 and 
for a scalar   while  is its adjoint with

,

. Also for a vector  and a -form 
 we define 
. ,

_1 = 1g^2  + 1g^2   g^2 1g^2 
+ i  _  * 
= 1g^2  + 1g^2   g^2 1g^2  
+ i   _  *  .
 
If we introduce a modified connection

_A_= _A_+ i g^2  
1  _ _ 
^  _ A_ ,
 
then  may be written in the form,

_1  ^  = & -^1g^2  _ 
_ ^  + 1g^2  X_ ^   , X_  = & g^4 _1g^2  _1g^2 
- g^2 __1g^2  + g^4 (
^_ _ 
- _ _) + R_   .  
 
The corresponding ghost operator
obtained from  is

_0 = 1g^2  =  - ^1g^2  _ .
 
Using 

g ^1g^2  _g = ^2 - X  , X =  g^2 ^2 1g^2  -  
 g^4 ^1g^2  _1g^2   ,
 
we may easily see from  and ,

 _1 = g _1 g = -  ^2 1 + Y_1  ,  _0 = g _0 g = -  ^2 + Y_0  ,
 
with .

The one loop effective action is then defined by

W^(1)  = -  _1 +  _0  .
 
For an operator  the functional determinant may be
defined in terms of the heat kernel,

- = _  '(0)  ,  _(s) = 1(s)  _0^  
^s-1   ( e^-  )  .
 
We here consider the response to a local Weyl rescaling of the metric
 for this classically
conformally invariant theory. Using  and
 we have

_ _1 =  & - 2  _1
+  2 1g  g^2 1g  + 1g 
 g^2 1g   2- 1g  4 g^2 1g  ,
_ _0 = & - 4  g  1g^2   g +
g   21g^2   g  ,  
 
so that, since 
 and using cyclicity of the functional trace,

_( (  e^- _1   ) -
2  (  e^- _0   ) ) = - 2  ( ( e^- _1   ) -
2   ( e^- _0   ) )  .
 
Hence with the definition  we have

_W^(1)  = ( e^- _1   ) 
_^0  - 2  ( e^- _0   ) 
_^0   ,
 
where  denotes the term  in the heat kernel
expansion. For operators of the form  we have

( e^-     )_^0  = 116^2  
^4 x   ( a_2^ )  ,
 
where the diagonal DeWitt coefficient is given by 
a_2^ = 1360  (3F-G)1 + 112  F^ F_ 
+ ( Y - 16   R )^2 -  16  
^2 Y +  130   ^2  R  1 .
 
with  the square of the Weyl tensor,  the Euler density, both
quadratic in the Riemann tensor

. , and .

Since according  both  and  are
of the required form we may readily obtain 
and  using . For the former we may note
that



















where  denotes the trace over vector indices and 
 is the Einstein tensor. In addition 

where  and












With these results it is straightforward to obtain from , 

16^2 _W^(1)  =  ^4 x  
( ( a_2^ _1  ) - 2 
( a_2^ _0  ))  ,
 
where, for  vector fields, we may write

( a_2^ _1  ) - 2  
( a_2^ _0  ) = c F - a G - h ^2 R 
+ n_V ( L- _^+ ^2 )  ,
 
which may be identified with  at one
loop.  can be reduced to the form

L= & g^4 (^2 1g^2  ^2 1g^2  +
^2 ^2 - 2 G^ ( 
_1g^2  _1g^2  +__)&  - R (^1g^2  _1g^2 
+ ^_) ) & - g^6 ( ^1g^2  _1g^2  ^2
1g^2  + 2 ^1g^2  _^2 - ^2
1g^2  ^_) & + g^8 ( 516   ^1g^2  _1g^2 
^1g^2  _1g^2  + 1312  
^1g^2  ^1g^2  __&  + 1124   ^1g^2  _1g^2  
^_+ 516   ^_
^_)  .   
 
In  we should take 
 but
they may be left general since they are altered by one loop contributions
for scalar and spinor fields.
,  and , which depend on , 
are not so affected. For  we also obtain

^=  & G^ g^2 _1g^2  +  g^4
^1g^2  ^2 1g^2  + 16   g^4
^^2 &  - 12   
g^6 ^1g^2 ^1g^2 _1g^2 
+ 112   g^6 ^1g^2  ^_-  g^6 ^1g^2  ^_ , = & 16   g^4 ^1g^2  _1g^2 
- 16   g^4 ^_ .   
 

We now demonstrate that  may be expressed in a form which exhibits manifest
 invariance. We define as usual

= 2  + i  4 g^2   ,
 
where  acts according to 
.
The quadratic terms in  correspond to the invariant line interval on the upper
half complex plane defined by

s^2 = 1(Im  )^2   ,
 
which describes the constant negative curvature hyperboloid.
With this metric the Christoffel connections are just 

, and we may then define

D^2 = ^2 +i Im   ^_ ,
D^2 = ^2 - i Im   
^_ .
 
and consequently rewrite  in the form

L=  & 14(Im  )^2  ( D^2 D^2 - 2 G^ 
__- R  ^_) & + 116(Im  )^4  ( ^_)^2
+ 148 (Im  )^4  ( ^^__- ( ^_)^2 
)  .   
 

The remaining terms given by  cannot be expressed in an 
invariant form but they can be removed by taking 
 with,

16^2 W_loc  =  & - n_V8   ^4 x  
g^2  G
&  -  n_V   ^4 x  (
18    g^4 ^2 1g^2  ^2 1g^2  +
124    g^4 ^2 ^2 - 16  R  &   -  
g^6  ^1g^2  _1g^2  ^2 1g^2  
- g^6   ^1g^2  _^2 + 
124  g^6 ^2 1g^2  ^_) ,
 
 
where we may easily calculate  using

 and 
. Save for the  term, 
which cancels the term involving 
 in , the terms present in 
reflect the usual arbitrariness up to local expressions in the effective action
arising from renormalisation scheme dependenceIn
 a calculation for  based on dimensional regularisation
gave different results for coefficients of the terms in  except for
the one involving . .

The possible presence of such additional local contributions may be seen 
by considering an alternative one loop effective action instead of 
W ^(1)  =  -  _1 +  _0  ,
 
where the operators  are given by  and ,
without the rescaling in  which is equivalent in the original action
to taking  and correspondingly for the ghost fields. With
the zeta function definition  we have for arbitrary 

- = 
(  e^-     )_^0   .
 
Hence we have
 16^2( W ^(1)  - W ^(1)  ) = 12  
 ^4x  g^2  (  c F - a G - h ^2 R 
+ n_V  ( L- _^+ ^2 ) )  .
 
The  term in  matches that in  if .
This is exactly the result for  supersymmetric gauge theories 
(when ). Under a Weyl rescaling 

the remaining terms just lead to an expression for 
which is of the form  with the same result  for  although
a modified . Exactly the same set of independent terms 
appear in the new  as are present in the formula in .
As before these may then be cancelled by a simple local counterterm 
of the same form as , with differing coefficients, but 
without the need now for a  term. To show this we need to
note that 

& _L= - 4L+ _( _ ^  )  , _  =  & g^4 ( _1g^2  _1g^2  
+ __) - _   g^4
( ^1g^2  _1g^2  
+ ^_)  .  
 
The form for  with  follows from
the consistency relations in , this condition constrains the
quadratic and cubic terms in  although it is not fully determined.


It would of course be interesting to extend these considerations beyond one loop
and to see whether  invariance is maintained.
In general we may write
 
16^2 _W =  &  ^4 x  (
c F - a G  - h ^2 R - 19   b R^2
+ L - _Z^+ ^2 Y  )  , _=  &  ^4x  ( - 2 ^  
^   + ^i g^i   )  ,  
 
for local couplings , with corresponding -functions , and where
 depend on their derivatives. Various consistency conditions were
derived in  from . For a simple gauge coupling ,
with , we may write

L = n_V& 1g^2  (  (^2 g)^2 - 2  G^ 
_g _g - 13    R ^g _g )  
&  - 2  1g^3  ^g _g ^2 g + 2  
1g^4  ^g _g ^g _g   ,  
 
and to two loop order using dimensional regularisation, for ,
extending the results in The coefficient of  in  is
corrected from . ,

=  & 1 + 13   ( 51 C - 20 R_- 72  
R_) ^2  , =  & 1 + 13   ( 29 C - 12 R_- 52  
R_) ^2  , =  & 1 + 43   ( 11 C - 4 R_- 12  
R_) ^2  , =  & 1 + 118   ( 323 C - 76 R_- 252  
R_) ^2  ,  
 
where it  are the gauge group generators acting on scalar,
fermion fields, 
. The results are scheme dependent.
For supersymmetric theories it is more natural to transform to a dimensional
reduction scheme by letting . For 
supersymmetry we let  and also add 
to  since there are Yukawa couplings proportional to  (for
more details see  ). This gives

=  & 1 + ( 13 C - 5 R) ^2  , = 1 + ( 7 C - 3 R ) ^2  , =  & 1 + 4( 3 C -  R ) ^2  , 
= 1 + 12   ( 31 C - 7 R ) ^2  .  
 
For  theories  and Yukawa couplings add a further 
to , giving now

=  & 1 + 10 ( C - R) ^2  , = 1 + 6 ( C - R ) ^2  , =  & 1 + 8( C -  R ) ^2  , 
= 1 + ( 12 C - 7 R ) ^2  .  
 
For , when there is a single adjoint hypermultiplet, , as is necessary
for a zero -function. In this case there are no corrections to
, in accord with consistency relations, although
 remains non zero. Even for  there are thus additional perturbative
contributions beyond one loop. It is natural to suppose that for  
in  extends with the inclusion of  to a form which is invariant under 
, where  and  becomes
an appropriate modular form.

A Two loop Calculations with Local Couplings 

We here revisit old calculations for the divergences at two loops 
for pure gauge theories using just the local coupling . Using integration 
by parts and Ward identities van der Ven  showed that the two loop vacuum 
amplitude on flat space can be reduced to just


W^(2)  =  & 
  gg' ( - (D_G_ , G_ 
D  ' _  , G_  ) +
2 (D_G_ ,G_ D  ' _ ,
G_  ) ) &  - 14   g^2 ( 2 (T_a G_() 
T_a G_ ) - (T_a G_ T_a G_ )
+ (T_a G_ ) (T_a G_ ) )  ,  
 
where the ghost contribution is cancelled. In the first line of ,
involving integrations over ,
 is the vector propagator,
, 
are the local gauge couplings and

D_= _+ v_(x)  , D  ' _  =   ' _ 
+ v_(x')  , v_= 1g  _g  .
 
In the second line of   and 
denotes the coincident limit  and the trace is over group indices 
. The counterterms necessary to subtract sub-divergences 
are given by (),









This form is in accord with that expected according to , combining the
ghost contribution here with the vector piece,
We note here the following misprints, in (5.7) the result for 
should have a  sign, in (5.1) .
Note also that the first two terms on the r.h.s. of (2.20) and the first three
on the r.h.s. of (2.21) should have the opposite sign.  
if we note the identity

D_G_  D  ' _  -
2 ( v_D_G_  
+ v_G_  D  ' _   ) 
+ 4 v_v_G_   = 0  .
 
Using an expansion of the propagators in terms of Seeley-DeWitt coefficients
 then in  a simple algorithm was given for calculating the poles
in ,

















Simplifying , using standard results for , we get

W^(2) _div  = - C n_V (16^2)^2   g^2  &
 223  ( (v )^2  + 2 v^2 v  + 2v^2v^2 
)  
&  - ( 172   (v )^2 + 73   
v^2 v  + 1069   v^2v^2 )   .
 
 
Correspondingly at one loop

W^(1) _div  = n_V 16^2   ( (v )^2
+ v^2v^2 )  .
 
To two loop order this gives

( -  (g)g  ) W_div  =
n_V 16^2   & (1+17C g ^2 ) 1g^2 (^2 g)^2
- 2( 1+ 443   C g ^2 ) 1g^3  (g)^2 ^2 g   
& + 2 ( 1+ 32318   C g ^2 ) 1g^4  (g)^2 (g)^2
