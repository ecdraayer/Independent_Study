Introduction 

The problem of quantum Yang-Mills (YM) 
theory has been extensively discussed 
for more than three decades resulting in such breakthroughs as the 
asymptotic freedom, the renormalizability proof, 
the Faddeev-Popov technique, the BRST symmetry, the Seiberg-Witten theory,  
duality and others.  
However, some of the fundamental issues such as the confinement 
problem and the existences of the mass gap are still not understood. 
It is therefore feasible to explore the potential of new approaches 
in solving these problems. 

A new method of precanonical  quantization of fields which is 
based on a manifestly covariant (space-time symmetric) version 
of the Hamiltonian formalism 
 
has been proposed recently in our papers 
. 
It is conceptually different from the standard picture of quantum 
field theory as an infinite dimensional quantum mechanics. 
Instead, precanonical quantization is based on the picture 
of classical fields as multi-parameter generalized Hamiltonian systems 
in the sense that all space-time variables 
enter on the equal footing as analogues of the single time 
variable in 

Hamiltonian mechanics. This guarantees the 
manifest covariance of the formulation. The corresponding 

(precanonical) 
configuration  space is a bundle of field variables over 
the space-time; the classical field configurations are the sections 
of this bundle.  
The wave functions of quantum fields, not functionals,  live 
on this bundle. Quantization of the abovementioned 
generalized Hamiltonian systems representing field theories 
leads to a multi-parameter, Clifford-algebraic generalization 
of quantum theory which reduces to the familiar 
complex Hilbert space quantum mechanics 
in the case of (0+1)-dimensional space-time whose corresponding 
Clifford algebra is the algebra of the complex numbers. 
The manifest covariance and the finite dimensionality of the 
analogue of the configuration space (on which the wave functions live) 
are the obvious advantages of the precanonical approach 
to field quantization.  
Unfortunately, many aspects of the relation 
of this approach to the standard techniques 
and notions of quantum field theory are not explored yet. 
However, a remarkable connection between precanonical 
quantization and the functional Schrodinger representation 
is already established 
. 

In this paper our aim is to consider precanonical quantization 
of pure YM theory 



 and to demonstrate its connection with 

the functional Schrodinger representation 
of quantum YM theory. As a by-product, the precanonical 
approach is used to argue the existence of the mass gap 
in the pure YM theory. 




The De Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian formulation of YM theory. 


The Lagrangian density of pure Yang-Mills theory is given by 
L= - 1 4  F_a F^a , 
where 
F^a_  := _A^a_- _A^a_
+ g C^a _bc  A^b_A^c_,  


 is the YM self-coupling constant and 
 are totally antisymmetric structure constants which 
fulfill the Jacobi identity  






Following the De Donder-Weyl (DW) Hamiltonian formulation 
 
we define the polymomenta
_a^  



:= L (_A^a_)  
= -^A_a^+ ^A_a^- g C_a _bc  A^b_A^c_
= - F_a^ , 
and the 
DW Hamiltonian 

H

= 
_a^ _A^a_- L 


= 
-1 4  _a  ^a  
+ g 2  C^a _bc A^b_A^c__a^  . 

Then the YM field equations take the DW Hamiltonian form: 
_^ _a &=& -H A^a_  
= 
-g C_abc A^b_^ _c  ,
 
 
_[  A^a_]  &=&  H ^ _a   
 = 1 2  _ ^a - 
1 2 g C^a_bc A^b_A^c_.
The antisymmetrization in the left hand side of the 
second equation makes the  DW Hamiltonian equations 
consistent with the primary constraint 
_a^ +_a^  0  
which follows from (2.3). 

It ensures the gauge invariance of (2.6). 
Instead of attempting to generalize the techniques of 
constrained dynamics to the DW formulation, in what follows  

the constraints will be taken into account heuristically. 
The Poisson brackets underlying precanonical quantization 
of the next section can be obtained from the 
so-called polysymplectic form 
:= d _a^ dA_[ ^a _] 

using the techniques of. However, this is 
beyond the scope of the present paper. 


 
Precanonical quantization of YM theory 

According to 
the prescriptions of precanonical quantization 
   
we set 
 _a^  
= - i^ A^a_   , 




where  are the generating elements of 
the space-time Clifford algebra. 
However, this expression is not consistent with the constraint 
(2.7). Let us take the latter into account as 
a constraint on the physical quantum states   
    




 _a^() > =0 ,   
that implies 





 










From (2.4) we obtain the DW Hamiltonian operator 
H  = 
 1 2  ^2^2  A_a^A^a_  
- 1 2 igC^a _bc A^b_A^c_
^ A^a_   , 
or symbolically,  




The quantum states are represented by  
Clifford-valued wave functions  




which fulfill  
the covariant Schrodinger equation proposed in 
 
i^_=H  . 
Note that the issue of gauge invariance is not directly relevant at this 
stage because it is related to the sections  
of the field bundle over space-time with the 
coordinates ,  rather than to the 
fiber coordinates  appearing here.   


It should be noticed that the DW Hamiltonian operator 
of YM theory (3) 
is not scalar as in the case of the scalar field theory 
.  
It can be decomposed into two parts: 

H  = H^0 + H^1, 
where  is the scalar free  part 
and   is the matrix interaction part. 
The presence of the latter term makes the restriction to the 
simple wave 
functions of the type , 
as in the case of scalar field theory, impossible; 
more general Clifford-valued wave functions are required. 

To see it let us write the covariant Schrodinger equation 
for the simple wave function assuming . 
Here we set for simplicity . From (4) it follows 
i _^&=& H^0+ H_^, 

i _&=& H^0_+ H_, 
 
i_[  _]  &=& H_[ _]  .
If  and there are no external fields, i.e. 
,  then (8) is the integrability condition of (7) 
and the restriction to a simple wave function 
 
is possible. 
If     and  
the integrability condition of (7) takes the form  





i.e. 
H^0 (i _[  _]  - H_[ _]   ) 
+ [H^0,H_[ ] _]  - [H_ , H_ ]= 0 . 

Using the antisymmetry of  one  proves that 
[H^0,H_  ]  = 0 . 
However, with the aid of the Jacobi identity and the 
antisymmetry of  one can show that 

 [ H_, H_] 

= C^e _cf  C^d _eb  A^b_l A^c_[  A^f_]  A^d_l 
0 .  
Therefore, (8) is no longer the integrability condition of (7) 
so that the truncation to the lower components of :  
and ,  in the case of pure YM theory is not justified, 
i.e. the higher components of  should be taken into account. 





































































 



A relation with the functional Schrodinger representation  

In this section we explore how the seemingly unusual precanonical 
quantization of YM theory is related to the familiar canonical 
quantization in the functional Schrodinger representation. 


Canonical quantization of pure YM theory. A reminder.  


Let us briefly recall the functional Schrodinger representation 
of the YM theory in the temporal gauge  
.  
The canonical momenta  are given by 
p^i_a () := d L (_t A^a_i) () = 
F_a^i0  () , 
and the canonical Hamiltonian functional 
(in the metric signature ) is  
 [A(), p^i_a ()] 
&:=&  d 
( p^i_a () __t  A^a_i () - L ) 


&=&  d 
( p^i_a() p^i_a() 

+ 1 4   F_a ^ij () F_a ^ij ()  ) . 

Henceforth the bold capital letters will denote functionals and 
the small bold letters denote the spatial components of 
space-time vectors, e.g. ; we also set .


The canonical momenta 
are represented (in the -representation) by the operators  
p^i_a () = i   A^a_i()  .

The quantum states are given by the wave functionals 
 which fulfill the 
 functional differential Schrodinger equation 


i_t = 
  d 
 ( -   A^i_a()  A^i_a()  
+ 1 4  F_a ^ij () F_a ^ij ()  
 ) .
The necessity for regularization arises 
here 
 because of the second variational derivative at equal points. 
We introduce a point-splitting based on a regulator 
 satisfying 



Therefore, the regularized functional Laplacian in (4) takes the form 
 d dK_(, A^i_a()  A^i_a( . 

 

 




In addition to the Schrodinger equation the wave functional 
fulfills the Gauss law constraint on the physical states:   
( _i  A^a_i()   +   
g C^a _bc  A^b_i  A^c_i()  
) = 0 ,  
which implies that the physical wave functionals are gauge 
invariant under  "small" (i.e. topologically trivial) 
time-independent gauge transformations.  





The derivation of the functional Schrodinger 
representation from the precanonical approach  

It is definitely of interest to understand how the functional 
Schrodinger representation of quantum YM theory  
can be related with 
 
precanonical quantization. In what follows 
we will show that the functional differential 
Schrodinger equation can be derived from the 
covariant Schrodinger equation of the precanonical approach. 
The relation of this kind has been studied in the case of scalar 
field theory in. 
 
Its extension to the pure YM fields in the temporal gauge 
is presented below. 

The basic idea is that the Schrodinger wave functional 
 which represents the probability amplitude of 
simultaneously observing the field configuration  
 at the moment of time  can be seen as a joint probability
amplitude of 
simultaneously observing the respective values   at the  
spatial points  (at the moment of time ). 
Those amplitudes are 
given by the wave function  restricted to the 
Cauchy surface : . 
Using the result of,  in the temporal gauge 
 
the corresponding composed amplitude is written as 
([A^a_i()],t) = 
tr (1+) e^d_(A_i^a(),,t) 
 =: tr  ,  

where  denotes the restriction of the 
Clifford-valued wave function  to the Cauchy surface .
This Ansatz establishes a link between 
 
the Clifford-valued wave function appearing in precanonical  quantization 
and the Schrodinger wave functional resulting from canonical quantization. 








Let us show that using the Ansatz (4.7) we can derive the 
familiar functional differential Schrodinger equation 
of the YM theory from the covariant Schrodinger equation (3.4). 
For this aid let us find the Schrodinger-type 
equation fulfilled by the functional amplitude (7) 
taking into account the covariant Schrodinger equation 
obeyed by . 

 
From (7) we obtain
i_t &=& tr  
d _^-1  i_t _
 , 

 
 A^i_a()   &=&
tr     _^-1    A_a^i  _
 , 
^2 A_i^a()A_i^a()   
 &=& tr     (
^2 _^-1   A_a^i  __^-1   A_a^i  _
. . 

&& . .  
- ^n-1  (0) _^-1   A_a^i  __^-1   A_a^i  _
  + ^n-1  (0) _^-1  
^2 A_a^iA_a^i   _) 
 . 

The singularity  ( is the space-time dimension) 
arises from 
the second functional differentiation at equal points. 
The simplest regularization 








amounts to the replacement of 
 with the momentum space cutoff . 
The latter has its counterpart in precanonical quantization 
as the constant  which has the meaning of 
. 
 Under the regularization 
 we obtain 
 ^2 A_i^a()A_i^a()   
 = tr      ^2 _^-1 
^2 A^a_i A^a_i  _
 . 





Now, let us substitute into (8) the expression of  
which one obtains from the wave equation on the restricted 
wave function . The letter is derived from the 
covariant Schrodinger equation (3.4):  
 
in the temporal gauge (i.e. by just dropping out ) 
we obtain 
i_t _= -i^i (d dx^i  
- _[i  A ^a_j]  ()  A^a_j   ) _
+ H  _, 

where 


 
is the total spatial derivative,  
and 
H  = 
- 1 2  ^2^2 
^2 A^a_i A^a_i    
-  ig 2 C^a _bc A^b_i A^c_j  
^j   A^a_i    
is the DW Hamiltonian operator in the temporal gauge, cf. (3.3).    
The antisymmetrization in  
 
is related to the fact that the symmetric part of the 
polymomentum operator  
vanishes on the physical (restricted) wave functions 
due to the quantum version of the constrain (2.7), eq. (3.2).  
In fact, due to the presence of the projector 
 in the definition of  
a weaker version of (3.2) is implied here: 
 





Thus, by substituting  from (12) to (8),  
discarding the total divergence term 
,  
and using (11), (13) we obtain 
  i_t  tr     
  
= tr         , 
where the matrix Hamiltonian operator is 
  &=& d( 
-  ^2   A_i^a()A_i^a()   
- ig 2   C^a _bc A^b_i() A^c_j()  
^j   A^a_i()   
. 
 
&&  +  i_[i   A^a_j]  () ^i  A^a_j()  
. 1 1   ) . 
In order to understand the relation of the matrix Hamiltonian 
 with the Schrodinger picture Hamiltonian 
(4)
let us consider a unitary transformation of  
  '  = e^-i   e^i  , 

where  is a functional operator. 
By a straightforward calculation we obtain 
e^-i    e^i 
&=&   d 
(-^2 i ^2 A ()  
- ( i A ()  )^ 2 
- 2 i A ()  A ()  
- ^2   ^2 A ()  
.

 
&& .
 
+  
2 e^-i  
[- ig 2   C^a _bc A^b_j() A^c_i()  
+  i_[i  A^a_j]  () ] ^i e^i   
 ( i A^a_j ()  
+  A^a_j () ) 
) . 

 

The condition that the transformed Hamiltonian  
contains no 
 
terms with the first order functional derivatives is 
 A_a^j()  = ^i ( 
 _[i  A^a_j]  ()
- g 2  C^a _bc A^b_j () A^c_i () ) 
= ^i F^a_ij ()
whence it follows 
^2  ^2 A ()  
(0) = 0 , 
 


 

(  A ()  )^2 = 
- 1 4  F^a_ij  F^a_ij  .  





Therefore, with the aid of the unitary transformation 
(16), where  is a solution of (18), the matrix-valued 
Hamiltonian  is transformed to the Schrodinger 
picture Hamiltonian operator of the YM theory: 

 _S =   d 
 ( -
 A^i_a()  A^i_a()  
+ 1 4  F^a_ij () F^a_ij ()  
 ) .

Correspondingly, the Schrodinger picture wave 
functional is given in terms of the Ansatz (7) as follows: 
_S = tr  e^-i    . 


Now, let recall that by dropping out  in (4.12) 
we actually lost the information of the  component of the 
DW Hamiltonian equations (2.5), which is the Gauss law. In order to 
restore it we have to require that  is invariant 
under the gauge transformations of . As we have already 
noticed, this automatically leads to the Gauss law constraint (4.6). 


Thus, the total set of equations of the functional 
Schrodinger representation of pure YM theory in the temporal gauge 
is derived  from the precanonical approach. 




Let us note that eq. (18) is formal because the second 
functional differentiation in (15) is formal and requires regularization. 
A regulator function 
 will appear then in the right hand side 
of (18) as 
, 
thus making the transformation operator  explicitly depending 
on the regulator. In the unregularized case 
 there are no solutions to (18) 
in the class 
of single-valued functionals of one argument 
.(In this 
issue was formally treated in the case 
of scalar field theory by resorting to the solution for  in terms 
of a functional of two arguments. The present treatment which 
recalls the necessity of regularization seems to be more satisfactory.)
