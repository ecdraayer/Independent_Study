 Abstract 



We calculate 3-point correlation functions of -BMN operators
with 3 scalar impurites in  supersymmetric gauge theory.
We use these results to test the pp-wave/SYM duality correspondence of the 
vertex-correlator  type. This correspondence relates the coefficients of
3-point correlators of -BMN operators in gauge theory to the 3-string 
vertex in lightcone string field theory in the pp-wave background.
We verify the vertex-correlator duality equation of hep-th/0301036 at 
the 3 scalar impurites level for supergravity and for string modes.






Introduction 

This paper continues the study of correlation functions of BMN operators
 in the light of the
pp-wave/SYM correspondence.

The pp-wave/SYM correspondence of Berenstein, Maldacena and Nastase (BMN) 
represents all massive modes of type IIB superstring in the plane wave 
background
in terms of composite BMN operators of  Yang-Mills theory in 4D.
In its minimal form, this correspondence emphasizes a duality relation 
between the masses of string states and the anomalous dimensions of the
corresponding BMN operators in gauge theory in the large  double 
scaling limit. 
This relation has been verified
in the planar limit of SYM perturbation 
theory 
in. 
Calculations in the BMN sector of gauge theory at the
nonplanar level were performed in
 also taking into account
mixing effects of planar BMN operators.
The minimal mass-dimension type duality relation was extended
into all orders in the effective genus expansion parameter 
and expressed in the form

Here  is the full string field 
theory Hamiltonian, and  is 
the gauge theory Hamiltonian
(the conformal dimension) minus the R-charge. Recent work in this 
direction
includes.

In this paper, instead, we address a more ambitious duality relation 
 of a 
vertex-correlator  type, summarized in the next Section.
This type of correspondence for pp-waves
was first discussed in and 
relates the coefficients of 3-point correlators of BMN operators
in gauge theory to 3-string vertices in lightcone string field theory in the
pp-wave background.
It is well-known that 
in the AdS/CFT scenario, in addition to the relation
between the masses of supergravity states and the 
dimensions of the dual gauge theory operators, 
one can also compare directly the
correlation functions in gauge theory with supergravity interactions
in the bulk. 
Since the pp-wave/CFT correspondence can
be viewed as a particular limit of the AdS/CFT correspondence, 
it is natural to expect that a version of vertex-correlator
type duality will hold in the pp-wave/SYM correspondence.

Building on previous work,
the authors of were able to represent all known gauge theory
results for 3-point functions of BMN operators with 2 scalar impurites
in terms of a single concise expression involving the 3-string vertex
in light-cone string field theory in the pp-wave background. 
The goal of the
present paper is to test this relation at the level of BMN operators with
3 scalar impurites. 

In conformal theory, the two- and three-point functions of conformal primary 
operators are completely determined by conformal invariance of the
theory. One can always
choose a basis of scalar conformal primary operators such that the 
two-point functions
take the canonical form:
 
and all the nontrivial information of the
three-point function is contained in the -independent 
coefficient :
 
where .
Since the form of the -dependence of conformal 3-point functions is universal,
it is natural to expect that 
is related to the interaction of the corresponding three string states
in  the pp-wave background.
Note, that in order to be able to use the coefficients ,
it is essential to work on the SYM side with -BMN operators.
These operators are defined in such a way that they do not mix 
with each other (i.e. have definite scaling
dimensions ) and which are conformal primary operators. 
Conformal invariance
of the  theory then implies that the 2-point correlators 
of scalar -BMN 
operators are canonically normalized, 
and the 3-point functions take the simple form 3pt . 
Defined in this way, the basis of -BMN operators is unique and distinct 
from other BMN bases considered in the literature. For 2 scalar impuritites,
this -BMN basis was constructed in.

In this paper we will work with scalar(Vector 
operators, i.e. -BMN operators with vector
impurites, discussed in, will be considered elsewhere.) 
-BMN operators 
with 3 impurites which correspond to 
the string bra-state .
In string theory 
 are the labels of string oscillators , 
and the level matching
constraint is . 
Bare single-trace BMN operators  with 3 different real scalar impurities 
 are given by
 
where  and , and from now on,
we always set . There are two terms on the right hand side
of 3imop  since there are two inequivalent orderings of ,
 and  inside the trace(Note that in both terms
 in the -position  is accompanied by , similarly for .
Hence, each of the two terms contributes to the same string state.) .
The pp-wave/SYM duality is supposed to hold in the BMN large  
double scaling limit,
J N   , N.

In this limit there remain two free finite dimensionless
parameters: 
the effective coupling constant of the BMN sector of gauge theory,
 = g_YM ^2 N J^2  = 1 (p^+ 
and the effective genus counting parameter
  
The right hand sides of lampr ,gtwo  express  and  in terms
of pp-wave string theory parameters.


Operators 3imop  are the starting point for building the -BMN operators.
In interacting field theory, bare operators have to be UV-renormalized and
the effects of operator mixing have to be taken into account. It is well-known
by nowthat the single-trace BMN operators mix with the multi-trace operators
even in free theory at non-planar level, i.e. starting from order .
Hence, in order to calculate the leading-order contribution to the 3-point coefficient
 in 3pt , one has to work with the order 
-BMN operators which involve the single-trace expressions 3imop 
plus a linear combination of double-trace operators with coefficients of 
order .
For the simpler case of 2 scalar impurites,
the single-double trace mixing effects have been calculated in, and the
corresponding conformal 3-point function coefficients  were determined. 
One of the main technical results of the present paper will be a determination
of the coefficients  for -BMN operators with 3 scalar impurities
(and general oscillator labels ).


The paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2 we summarize the vertex-correlator duality proposal
of and write down the relevant equations.
In Section 3 we calculate 2-point correlators of operators 
to order  in planar perturbation theory in the BMN limit. This
is necessary in order to canonically normalize the UV-renormalized operators
to order . 
Section 4 contains our main technical results on the field theory side. 
There we calculate 3-point functions involving operators  .
We first derive the conformal expression 3pt  and extract the coefficient
 for 3-point functions containing 1 general and 2 chiral operators
(i.e. 1 string and 2 supergravity states in dual string theory).
We then generalize this calculation of  to the case of two string states.
In the final Section we demonstrate that the results of Section 4 are in complete
agreement with the vertex-correlator duality prediction of Section 2.


The vertex-correlator duality 

Here we give a brief summary of the duality relation.
For more detail, we refer the reader to
.

For the bosonic external string states 
the proposed correspondence relation is
(_1+_2-_3) C_123 
= 
_1 _2_3  P  
( 1 2  _,_m,n=- ^_I=1 ^8 ^ I _m  _mn ^   
^ I _n ) 0 _123 .

This relation, is conjectured to be valid to all orders in  and to the
leading order in  in the double scaling limit doublel .
Equation hhhh ,
originally proposed in, is the first
key element of the vertex-correlator duality.
 are the Neumann matrices in the -basis
of string oscillators.
These matrices were recently calculated in as an 
expansion in inverse powers of  at .
Results of for 
constitute the second element of the proposed duality.
The relevant for us leading order expressions of  directly in the
-oscillator basis can be found
in the the Appendix.

The third and final element of the vertex-correlator duality is the 
expression for the bosonic part of
the string field theory prefactor, , 
which appears on the right hand side of hhhh ,
P  = (-1)^p
C_norm (P _I +P _II )  ,
where(We are using standard definitions for the SFT 
quantities in the pp-wave background such as 
,  and , which are summarized in the Appendix.) 
P _I  = 
_m=- ^+ _m  _  
^ I _m ^ I _m  ,
P _II  = 1 2 
_,3 _m,n > 0 
_m  _ 
(N ^ _m -n  - N ^ _m n )
(^ I  _m ^ I _n + 
^ I  _-m  ^ I  _-n  - 
^ I  _m  ^ I  _-n  - ^ I  _-m  
^ I _n  )
and
C_norm  = g_2 y(1-y)  J  = C^vac _123   .
The only new ingredient here compared to is the overall sign 
in pf , where 
 counts the number of impurities.
For all the cases involving BMN operators with 2 impurities considered in, 
it turns out that , and hence is irrelevant.
In the present paper, all the cases involving 3 impurities will lead to an overall
minus sign,  .

In terms of the original SFT -oscillator basis the full prefactor takes a 
remarkably simple form
P  = (-1)^pC_norm   _=1 ^3  (
_m > 0  
_m  _ 
a^ I  _m  a^ I _m 
+  sign  (_) a_0^ I   a_0^ I 
) ,
however, as in, we will continue using the prefactor 
in the BMN -oscillator basis, pf1  and pf2 , where the
comparison with the gauge theory BMN correlators is most direct.

This prefactor, and in particular the second term , 
was constructed in to 
reproduce a particular class of field theory results
for the 3-point functions(
A first principles
derivation of the string field theory prefactor is highly
desirable, but (at least in our view) not yet available
inspite of much progress made
in the pp-wave lightcone string field theory
.
We note that pf  is different from the earlier proposals for the prefactor 
in.) .
 It was then successfully tested 
in against all the available field theory results involving
BMN operators with 2 scalar impurites and also the simplest cases
involving BMN operators with 3 impurities.
In Section 5 we will verify that the duality relation hhhh 
with the prefactor  pf  holds at the 3-impurity level.

********** 

We emphasize that the
matching to field theory results is highly non-trivial even though
the choice of the
prefactor in pf  is "phenomenological". In the next
two Sections we will assemble a detailed SYM calculation of the
3-point coefficients for BMN correlators with 3 impurities, gdef ,
gpdef . This calculation is presented in detail
in order to convince
the reader that a coincidental  agreement of our SYM results and the 
string vertex with the prefactor pf  
(which a priory knows nothing about 3-impurity operators) is
very unlikely. 
The reader primarily interested in the tests of the correspondence,
can skip directly to the final SYM results,
Eqs. cst123 , c0123  and ctil123 , ctil0 
and then to the last Section.




Two-point correlators 

As explained earlier, on the SYM side of our proposed correspondence 
we must use the -BMN operators . For BMN operators with 
2 scalar impurities this basis was
constructed in to order  and
 and involves a linear combination
of the original single-trace BMN operator and the double-trace 
(in general multi-trace)
BMN operators.

There are two important cases where simplifications occur such that at the leading 
non-vanishing order in , only the single-trace operators 3imop  need
to be taken into account. The first case involves 2-point functions
, and will be considered in this Section.
The second case involves
3-point functions , where 
 and  are chiral BMN operators, and  is a general one, 
i.e. two supergravity and one string state in dual string theory. 
This case will be considered in the first part of the next Section.
It is easy to check (see e.g.)
that in both cases the contributions from 
double- and higher trace operators to 's give vanishing contributions
to the correlators at the leading order in
 and in the double-scaling limit doublel .

Before we continue we make a final general comment. 
One can split scalar interactions of the  SYM 
Lagrangian into D-terms, F-terms and K-terms as is done in 
 and show that at one loop level 
the  D-terms cancel against the gluon exchanges 
and scalar self-energies. So one is left only with  
F-terms and K-terms. However the K-terms have vanishing 
contribution in the cases we are going to consider since  
K-terms couple only to SO(6) traces.
Thus, there is only an F-term interaction to consider
which has a factor of  for every 
vertex where a  line crosses a 
 line,
and a factor of  when the lines 
do not cross.

In this Section we calculate 2-point correlators 
of renormalized operators 3imop  in planar perturbation theory
to order . This is needed to normalize the operators correctly,
such that 2pt  holds at order . In this and the next Section we 
will be calculating Feynman diagrams 
in dimensional reduction to  dimensions, and
in coordinate space. Our calculations follow and generalize the approach of.

We note that bare operators in 3imop  were normalized in such a way
that their free 2-point planar correlator is 
 
in the BMN limit doublel . 
Here  is the scalar propagator,
(x)=(1-)  (4 ^2- )(x^2 )^1-   
There are four contributions to consider, 
,
, 
 and
. 
The last two correlators vanish in free theory (since the 3 's are different),
and will be shown to vanish also at order  at the planar level.

We first calculate the interacting part of 
, 
 ^123 (0) ^123 (x) =(x)^J+3  J^2  (-g_YM ^2 N) I(x) (P_1 +P_2 +P_3 )
where  is the interaction integral
with  removed: 
I(x) &=& ((1-) 4 ^2-  )^2 (x^2)^2-2 
d^4-2 y (y^2)^2-2  (y-x)^2(2-2)  

&=& 1 8^2  (1   + +1 + + x^2 + O()).
We will use a subtraction scheme which subtracts the  pole together
with (an arbitrary) finite part 
 
,  and  on the right hand side of ottott 
are the total contributions of the phase factors for the diagrams
of Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3 respectively. 
Denoting by ,  the BMN phases of the 
 operator, and by
 the BMN phases of the 
 operator, we obtain
  
To derive pone  we have added the contributions of four diagrams 
in Figure 1 and noted that
contributions of diagrams where a  line crosses a  line 
in the - interaction (the second and the fourth diagrams in Figure 1)
have a relative minus sign compared to the - interaction without crossing
(the first and the third diagrams in Figure 1).


Similarly from four diagrams of Figure 2 and from four diagrams of Figure 3 we get

We now evaluate the double sum:
* 
=    . 
  
It is clear that, in the BMN limit doublel , 
the correlator is non-zero only when 
, 
that is, when the operators in the correlator are the same.

The result for the second correlator,  
, 
is obtained from the first one by interchanging labels 2 and 3.
The sum of the two contributions,

, will have the second term
on the right hand side of arrr  doubled up, and the third and fourth terms
cancelled.

We now show that the other two correlators
 and
,
vanish in our case. There are 12 diagrams to consider,
the first 6 are shown in Figure 4.

Their sum is also zero.  
 


The combined phase factor with these six diagrams is:
 
The remaining six diagrams are obtained from the ones in Figure 4
by exchanging  and  . 
They also sum to zero.
Thus, the non-diagonal terms do not contribute 
to the correlator at the planar level. 

Finally, 
combining with the free result we obtain
 
where the four terms in curly brackets 
correspond respectively to the free contribution,
,  and .
Now, substituting Ix  for  with a subtraction sub ,
and using an expansion
(x)^  1+(x)
=1+(-4^2 -x^2 )+O())
we derive the final expression for the 2-point function,
 _n_1 n_2 n_3  (0)
_n _1 n _2 n _3  (x)=_n _2 n _2  
_n_3 ,n _3  (x)^J+3+ 
[1-(+1-4
where  denotes
2 [(n_2 +n_3 )^2 +n_2 ^2 + n_2 ^2 ],

and, from the right hand side of c2fin , it has to be identified with
the anomalous dimension of ,
3+ 
2 [(n_2 +n_3 )^2 +n_2 ^2 + n_2 ^2 ], 
in agreement with dual string theory prediction.

The normalized operator is given by
 


Three-point functions 

Here our goal is evaluate 3-point functions involving BMN operators with 3 
scalar impurities in planar perturbation theory to order .
We will consider two such 3-point functions,
 G_3 (x_1 ,x_2 )=
  _n_1 n_2 n_3  ^J (0)
 _n_1 ' n_2 ' n_3 ' ^J_1  (x_1 ) 
 _vac ^J_2  (x_2 )and
 G'_3 (x_1 ,x_2 )=
  _n_1 n_2 n_3  ^J (0)
 _n_2 ' -n_2 ' ^J_1  (x_1 ) _0 ^J_2  (x_2 )Here  
with , is a -BMN operator with
3 scalar impurities, it is given by 3imnorm  plus multi-trace
expressions(In fact, it follows from the analysis of
 that at the relevant to us first order in ,
only the double-trace corrections and only to
the barred operators in gdef  and gpdef  give    
non-vanishing contributions.) 
at higher orders in . The operator 
 is a -BMN operator with
2 scalar impurities, at the classical single-trace level it is given by
_n_2 ' -n_2 ' ^J_1  =
1 J N^ J_1 +2   
_l=0 ^ J_1  r_2 ^l (_1 Z^l _2 Z^J_1-l ),
and the remaining operators are chiral and are protected against 
quantum corrections,
_0 ^J_2  =1 N^ J_2 +1   (_3 Z^J_2 )  , _vac ^J_2   =1 J_2 N^ J_2    (Z^J_2 ).
We also note that the R-charge conservation implies that
J_2 = J - J_1
In the first subsection we will derive conformal expressions 3pt 
and determine the 3-point coefficients  for both of these Green functions
in the settings where the barred operator is general, and the two 
unbarred operators are chiral, i.e. correspond to two supergravity states.
As mentioned earlier, in this case, only the single-trace contributions
to the operators are relevant at the leading non-vanishing order in ,
thus simplifying our analysis significantly.

In the second subsection we will calculate the 3-point coefficients of
gdef  and gpdef  in the general case of two non-chiral operators.
Here the double-trace corrections are important, in order to derive the
conformal expression 3pt . However, using a simple trick 
we will show how to
uniquely determine the coefficients  directly from the single-trace
expressions for the operators, thus obtaining the main results of this Section,
Eqs. cst123 , c0123  and ctil123 , ctil0 .


One string and two supergravity states 

As explained above, in this subsection only,
we set  and consider
 G_3 (x_1 ,x_2 )=
  _n_1 n_2 n_3  ^J (0)
 _000 ^J_1  (x_1 ) 
 _vac ^J_2  (x_2 )and
 G'_3 (x_1 ,x_2 )=
  _n_1 n_2 n_3  ^J (0)
 _00 ^J_1  (x_1 ) _0 ^J_2  (x_2 )At first we consider the 3-point function  
and express it as follows: 
 
where  and  and  are the combined phase-factors

 is the interaction integral for the diagrams 
depicted on Figures 6-9 (as in):
 
The first fraction on the right hand side of g3first 
arises from the normalization of . 
The denominator of the second fraction arises from the normalizations 
of the other two operators, while the summation over the  loops 
gives a factor of . 
The remaining factor of 
comes from the Wick contractions with .

Free diagrams are shown in Figure 5. 
There are six diagrams because of the six different ways 
of arranging three  's in a trace. 
We denote with  the combined phase factor of a free diagram where
 comes first,  is second and   is third.

We have:

in the trace. Also it is easy to see that  is equal 
to  with   
and  exchanged,  is  
with  and  exchanged and, 
 is  with  and

The sum of the six 's is:
X=J^3 _0 ^J_1 /J da_0 ^J_1 /J db
_0 ^J_1 /J dc  e^-2n_2 (b-a)  
e^-2n_3 (c-a) 
For example the part of the above sum with  is , 
the part with  is  and so on. 
Evaluating the integral we get
X=J^3 2^3   (n_2 J_1 /J)(n_3 J_1 /J)
((n_2 +n_3 )J_1 /J) (2)^3 
(n_2 +n_3 )n_2 n_3  
We now calculate the phase factors coming from interacting planar 
diagrams.
In the case where   interacts with  we have eight diagrams with the
first four shown in Figure 6 and the remaining four obtained by
interchanging  and  . We do not need to consider diagrams where
 interacts with  since they will be suppressed in the BMN limit
doublel  relative to - interactions of Figure 6.

Converting the sum into an integral we get

We must add 4 more diagrams with  and

In the case where   interacts we have again eight diagrams, 
see Figure 7.

The combined phase factor of four diagrams in Figure 7 is easily

comparing diagrams in Figures 6 and 7 and remembering that .
In the BMN limit we have,
Y_231

-e^-A_2 J_1 /J (A_2 +A_3 )
+e^-(A_3 +A_2 )J_1 /J A_2

Now we consider the above diagrams with   and

e^-A_2 J_1 /J A_3
+e^A_3 J_1 /J A_2 -A_2-A_3  A_3 (A_2 +A_3 ) 
Summing the above contributions we arrive at

A few comments are in order.
First, we note that we have proved that to order 
in  and  we are working here,
 takes
the conformal form of 3pt . This is so since
g3res1  is nothing other than the conformal
expression 3pt  for . Second, we have derived 
the expression for the coefficient  given by
cg3res1 . This expression does not depend on 
and, hence, is the subtraction scheme independent, as expected.
In what follows, and in parallel with, we will
use only the leading order in  part of , i.e.
will set  in cg3res1 . This is because
the, yet unaccounted, mixing effects at order  can change
constant  order  contributions to  
(but not the logarithms in eqrefg3res1 , which cannot appear in
the -independent mixing matrices).

  
 Three-point correlator  

We now consider the second 3-point function, ,
of Eq. gpdefch .
Its structure is much the same as for  
leading to the following expression

Converting the above sun into an integral one finds

Now we have to account for the interacting diagrams. 
In the case where  takes part in the interaction 
we have four diagrams which are shown in Figure 11.
The corresponding phase factor is

In the case where  takes part in the interaction 
we have again four diagrams which are shown in Figure 12.

For interacting  there are eight diagrams.

The phase factor associated with the four diagrams of Figure 13
in the BMN limit is
 
The phase factor  for the remaining four diagrams is obtained

Taking everything into account, our final expression for
 takes the conformal form
 
with the 3-point coefficient
 
This expression is again subtraction scheme independent.
As in the case of  discussed earlier, we will set 
 on the right hand side of cprch  to be safe from
unknown mixing effects at order .

Three-point functions with two string states 

We are now ready to finally address the general case and
calculate the 3-point coefficients of
gdef  and gpdef  for two non-chiral operators.
Here the mixing of the known single-trace BMN operators
with double-trace corrections is important as it does contribute
to the conformal expression 3pt . 
However, our goal is not to derive the conformal expression
on the right hand side of  3pt  (which must be correct anyway,
as far as the mixing effects are such that we are dealing
with scalar conformal primary operators). Our goal is to calculate
the coefficient . At leading order, the only mixing effect which 
contributes to the right hand side of  3pt  is the mixing with 
the double-traces of the barred operator 

in gdef  and gpdef . These mixing effects will affect
the free-theory contribution  and also the logarithmic
terms  and  due to interactions of
the double-trace in  with the
BMN operators at  and . But, these mixing effects cannot affect
the third logarithm, . Hence out programme is
to assume the conformal form, and by carefully evaluating the terms
proportional to , to determine . In doing so we
can neglect the double-trace corrections and work with the
original single-trace expressions.

We start with
 G_3 (x_1 ,x_2 )=
  _n_1 n_2 n_3  ^J (0)
 _n_1 ' n_2 ' n_3 ' ^J_1  (x_1 ) 
 _vac ^J_2  (x_2 ) .
The calculation is done as in the previous subsection, except that 
now we have additional phase factors coming from non-zero
 and .
The result for phase factor  coming from the free diagrams of 
Figure 5 
is obtained from twentyone 
by substituting  for
 and  for  
where .
The final result is 
 
To simplify notation somewhat, we will define 
 
Next we evaluate the interacting diagrams of Figure 6,
 
Converting the last sum into an integral we obtain,
 
where , 
, 
 and 
.
Expression for  is obtained by interchanging
 and  in  .
 After some algebra we get
Y_123 +Y_132 =4(n_3 +n_2 )(n_3 +n_2 -
n_2 '+n_3 ' y )J  
  Similarly, for diagrams of Figure 7 we obtain (in the BMN limit)
 

Now consider the above diagrams with   and 
 exchanged. In the BMN limit we find
 
Summing the two we arrive at
Y_231 +Y_213 =4 n_2 (n_2 -n_2 ' y )J  
   .
Similarly for the diagrams of 
Figure 8 we get:
Y_312 +Y_321 =4 n_3 (n_3 -n_3 ' y )J    .
Using the above phase factors and concentrating 
on the logarithmic terms of the 3-point function we have
 
The last term in the equation above comes from the diagrams of  
Figure 9 which no longer sum to zero as 
in the case with two supergravity states. 
However we do not need to know the coefficient of this term since the 
 receives corrections from the the double-trace operators.
From the equation above one can easily read 
the coefficient  at order 
 C_123 = C_123 ^(0)  n_2 (n_2 
 -n_2 ' y )+n_3 (n_3 
-n_3 ' y )+(n_3 +n_2 )(n_3 +n_2 
-n_2 '+n_3 ' y ) 
n_2 ^2 +n_3 ^2 +(n_2 +n_3 )^2 
-n_2 '^2 +n_3 '^2 +(n_2 '+n_3 ')^2  
y^2  
 
where 
C_123 ^(0) =JJ 1-y  N y ^3  
 (n_2 y )(n_3 y )
((n_2 +n_3 )y ) (n_2 +n_3 
-n_3 '+n_2 ' y )(n_2 
-n_2 ' y )(n_3 -n_3 ' y ) 
 
 Three-point correlator  

Finally we consider the  function with two string states   
 G'_3 (x_1 ,x_2 )=
  _n_1 n_2 n_3  ^J (0)
 _n_2 ' -n_2 ' ^J_1  (x_1 ) _0 ^J_2  (x_2 )> 
Similarly to the earlier analysis, we determine  from 
free diagrams in Figure 10,
P=- J^3 (n_2 y)
(n_3 y)((n_3 
+n_2 ) y) ^3 (n_3 +n_2 
-n_2 ' y )(n_2 -n_2 ' y )n_3  
The diagrams of Figure 11, Figure 12 and Figure 12 
lead to the expressions for ,  and  
respectively
 
 
  
Using the above results the three-point function reads
 
where 
C _123 ^(0) =-JJ  y  
N ^3  (n_2 y)
(n_3 y)((n_3 +n_2 ) 
y) (n_3 +n_2 -n_2 ' y )
(n_2 -n_2 ' y )n_3  
And our final expression for  is
C _123 =C _123 ^(0) 
n_3 ^2 +n_2 (n_2 -n_2 ' y )
+(n_3 +n_2 )(n_3 +n_2 -n_2 ' y ) 
n_2 ^2 + n_3 ^2 +(n_2 +n_3 )^2 
-2n_2 '^2  x^2    
Tests of the correspondence 

In this section we test the correspondence proposed in 
 and outlined in Section 2 against the gauge theory
results of Section 4.


 
 

In this case the external string state is
 
In the expression above, 1 and 3 denote the first and the third
string in the vertex. In order to avoid confusion, and distinguish
from the indices  corresponding to scalar impurites, 
, , ,
we label the latter with , , .
Since all three SYM impurities are different, we note
that  and the repeated indices
in the external states are not summed over.

The contribution of the first part of the prefactor  is 
 
which, using the expression for the Neumann matrices 
(see Appendix),
^31 _mn  =^31 _-m-n   =  (-1)^m+n+1   
(m y) y (m-n/y) +(
1 ^2 ),
becomes
 P _I  V_B 
=-1 2y^3/2  ^3  
[n_2 '^2 +n_3 '^2 +(n_2 '
+n_3 ')^2  y^2  -n_2 ^2 -n_3 ^2 -(n_2 +n_3 )^2 ]
   
Now consider  . The contributing terms in 
 for the state under consideration are 
 
Using this 
 we find
 
Recalling that  and 
 and substituting into
the above result the expressions Nppex  for the
Neumann matrices  and expressions 
for the Neumann matrices  (see Appendix)
N^31 _-m-n  = 2 (-1)^m+n   
n (m y) y^3/2 (m^2-n^2/y^2) +(1 ^2 ), 
we obtain
 P_II V 0=-1 2^3 y^5/2  [n_2 '(n_2 
-n_2 ' y )+n_3 '(n_3 
-n_3 ' y )+n_1 '(n_1 -n_1 ' y )] Adding these results for   and  
 
and multiplying by 
 
we get the string theory answer
 
which is exactly the SYM result , 
,
since
(_1 +_2 -_3 )=
1 2 
[n_2 '^2 +n_3 '^2 +
(n_2 '+n_3 ')^2  y^2  -n_2 ^2 -n_3 ^2 
-(n_2 +n_3 )^2 ]
and , given by cst123 , c0123 ,
reads
  C_123 = 
 JJ 1-y  N y ^3  
  n_2 (n_2 
 -n_2 ' y )+n_3 (n_3 
-n_3 ' y )+(n_3 +n_2 )(n_3 +n_2 
-n_2 '+n_3 ' y ) 
n_2 ^2 +n_3 ^2 +(n_2 +n_3 )^2 
-n_2 '^2 +n_3 '^2 +(n_2 '+n_3 ')^2  
y^2  
   .


 

In this case the external string state is
 
and the operator  is
 
Using the cyclic property of the trace,  
 can also be written as
 
where  
and . 
Hence, we find the 3-point function 
for this process 
by substituting 
,  
and  into the SYM 
expression cstagain  and also to dimsdef .


Thus, the result on the gauge theory 
side for this process is
 

On the string theory side of the correspondence
the calculation follows the same lines as in 5.1 ,
and the result
is in precise agreement with the SYM formula sevf .

This is also true for the remaining four cases 
involving different permutations of the three 
's in the trace of the shortest BMN operator.



 

Here we consider the case which corresponds
to , i.e. where instead of the vacuum 
state for the string 2, we have a supergravity state. 
The external string state now is
 
The result in the SYM side can be obtained from 
ctil123  and ctil0  and is
 
This expression is again, as it is easy to check
using the Neumann matrices from the Appendix,
in precise agreement with the expression on
the string theory side  of the duality relation
hhhh .


 

As a final example we consider the case where  
the external string state  is
 
The result on the SYM side 
is given by 
 
which is in precise agreement with the string vertex-correlator 
duality prediction hhhh .

Appendix 

Here we outline the pp-wave string field theory conventions used in the text.
The combination  for the r-th string is denoted 
and . As is standard in
the literature, we will choose a frame in which 
_= ()   : _3=-1, _1=y, _2=1-y.
In terms of the  R-charges 
of the BMN operators in the 
three-point function, 
, 
where , we have
y=J_1 J , 1-y=J_2 J , 0<y<1.
The effective SYM coupling constant lampr  in the frame frame 
takes a simple form
 =  1 (p^+ 1 (_3)^2  
= 1 ^2 .
Here  is the mass parameter which appears in the pp-wave metric, in
the chosen frame it is dimensionless(It is  which is
invariant under longitudinal boosts and is frame-independent.)  and the
expansion in powers of  is equivalent to the perturbative
expansion in . Finally the frequencies are defined via,
_m = m^2+(_)^2 .
 
The infinite-dimensional Neumann matrices,  are usually specified
in the original -oscillator basis of the string field theory. 
In this basis
the bosonic overlap factor  of the 3-strings vertex is given by
V_B  = ( 1 2  _,_m,n=- ^ a^ I _m  N_mn ^   a^ I _n ) 0 .
However, for the purposes of the pp-wave/SYM correspondence it is more convenient
to use another, the so-called BMN or -basis of string oscillators,
which is in direct correspondence with the BMN operators in gauge theory. The two
bases are related as follows:
_n = 1 2  (a_n  - i  sign (n) a_-n ),
_0 = a_0,
and satisfy the same oscillator algebra
[_m, _n^] = _mn .
In this basis, the bosonic overlap factor Vbab  in the vertex reads
V_B  = ( 1 2  _,_m,n=- ^^ I _m  N _mn ^   ^ I _n ),
where  are the Neumann matrices in the -basis and
are related to the 's via (here ):

&& ^ _mn  = ^ _-m-n  := 
1 2 (N^ _mn  -N^ _-m-n ), 

&& ^ _m-n  = ^ _-m n  := 
1 2 (N^ _mn  + N^ _-m-n ), 

&& ^ _m0  =^ _-m0  := 1 2   
N^ _m0 =
^ _0m  =^ _0-m , 

&&  ^ _00 :=N^ _00 .
We now copy the explicit expressions for the Neumann matrices 
in the -basis from the Appendix of.
These expressions are needed
for our calculations in Section 5.

1 ^2 ), 

&&N^21 _-m-n  = (1 ^3 ),

2(-1)^m+n    (m y)(n y)
+ (1 ^3 ), 

&&N^11 _-m-n  = (1 ^3 ), 

&&N^22 _-m-n  = (1 ^3 ).
&&N^33 _00  = 0, N^31 _00  =-y , 
N^32 _00  =-1-y , 

&&N^12 _00  = 1  (-1) 4 1 y(1-y)    
= N^21 _00 , 

&&N^11 _00  = 1  1 4 
1 y , 

&&N^22 _00  = 1  1 4 
1 1-y .

For the zero-positive Neumann matrices below we have 
N^31 _0n = 0, N^32  _0n  =0, N^33  _0n  =0.
&&N^13 _0n  = 2  (-1)^n+1
