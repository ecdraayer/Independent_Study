Abstract 
We solve closed string theory in all regular homogeneous plane-wave
backgrounds with homogeneous NS three-form field strength and a dilaton.
The parameters of the model are constant symmetric and anti-symmetric
matrices  and  associated with the metric, and a constant
anti-symmetric matrix   associated with the NS field strength.
In the light-cone gauge the rotation parameters  have a natural
interpretation as a constant magnetic field.  This is a generalisation
of the standard Landau problem with  oscillator energies now  being
non-trivial  functions of the parameters   and .
We  develop a  general procedure for solving linear but non-diagonal
equations for string coordinates, and determine the corresponding
oscillator frequencies, the light-cone  Hamiltonian and level matching
condition.  We investigate the resulting string spectrum in detail
in the four-dimensional case and compare the results with previously
studied examples. Throughout we will find that the presence of the
rotation parameter  can lead to certain unusual and unexpected
features of the string spectrum like new massless states at non-zero
string levels, stabilisation of otherwise unstable (tachyonic) modes,
and discrete but not positive definite string oscillator spectra.

 




Introduction 


A  renewal of interest  in plane wave  backgrounds
in string theory
blabla,mt,bmn,rt  prompts one to
study systematically
various  examples of solvable models of strings
moving in such "null" spaces, extending
early work on this subject amat,hos,veg .
Among the   motivations (see prt  for a detailed discussion)
is a desire to learn more about
patterns of string spectra
in non-trivial curved backgrounds.

Here we will investigate  a seemingly simple but non-trivial class
of plane wave models that escaped  detailed attention
until  recently mm . It is  based  on the
plane wave metric
ds^2=2dudv + k_ij  x^i x^j du^2 + 2 f_ij  x^i  dx^j du+ dx^i dx^i    ,
may 
supported by a null 2-form potential, ,
and dilaton.

We shall mostly consider the model for which the matrices  and
 are constant. In that case the metric may  is regular and 
homogeneous. If these matrices do not commute,  cannot  
be eliminated by a coordinate transformation while keeping the -coefficient
-independent. 
The constant matrix  can be interpreted as a "rotation" mm    or
"magnetic field"  ruts  parameter.
Indeed,  the quantum mechanics of a relativistic particle propagating
in the four-dimensional plane wave with
 and  in the  gauge
is  described by the Schrodinger equation for a two-dimensional
non-relativistic oscillator coupled  to a constant magnetic field of
strength  with  frequencies proportional to .
This is a generalisation of the standard Landau problem (for which
). The solution of the more general problem has been given
in yonei  and references therein. For positive  the  energy is
unbounded from below,  reflecting the possibility for a particle to escape
to infinity in the corresponding direction.  Switching on a non-zero 
tends to stabilise the motion, trapping the trajectories near
the center of -space.

We find the classical solutions of a closed string propagating in may 
in the presence of constant null NS 3-form field strength. For this we
shall develop a formalism, based on what we will call 
the frequency base ansatz, which allows for the
diagonalisation of the quantum mechanical problem.  Then we quantise
the theory in the light-cone gauge, compute the canonical commutation
relations and determine the  string spectrum. We shall
show that the frequencies depend on the parameters 
and  in a more  intricate way than in some previously discussed
examples    mt,bmn,rt .  In particular, for  certain values of the
parameters there is a possibility that some  states at non-zero string
levels become  massless. We shall compute the string Hamiltonian and
investigate the level-matching condition.

Throughout we will find that the presence of the rotation parameter 
leads to certain unusual and unexpected features of the string spectrum. For
instance, it may  stabilise  otherwise unstable (tachyonic) modes,
the string oscillator spectrum may be discrete but not positive
definite, and the level-matching condition for low-lying string modes
can differ from the usual form of the level-matching condition by signs.

In some special cases,  there is an  analogy with  string oscillator
spectra  found in the case of the  "standard" () plane waves
supported by a non-constant null   background in war .
It is possible that the metric may  supplemented  by appropriate
null background fluxes is the Penrose limit of some complicated
ten-dimensional geometries which are  "deformations" of the 
 background.  In that case the string spectrum we shall find
below may be  relevant for comparison with its gauge-theory counterpart
along the lines of bmn  (cf. prez ).

The paper is organised as follows. In section two, we review some
aspects of string backgrounds with pp-wave or  plane wave metrics. Then
we turn to the special case of string backgrounds with homogeneous plane
wave metrics supported by other homogeneous fluxes like for example a
homogeneous three-form NS-NS field strength. We  discuss the solution
of the Klein-Gordon equation  for the corresponding four-dimensional
non-singular homogeneous plane wave metric, explaining its equivalence
(in the light-cone frame) to the "2-dimensional oscillator in magnetic
field" problem.  We investigate the properties of the spectrum of the
corresponding Hamiltonian as a function of  the parameters of the plane
wave metric.

In section three, we give the most general classical solution of a closed
string in a non-singular homogeneous plane wave background using the so
called frequency base ansatz. We illustate the procedure in the case of
four-dimensional plane waves and then go on to determine the canonical
commutation relations, the light-cone Hamiltonian and the closed string
level matching conditions in general.

In section four, we apply the above results to  study some  aspects
of  string theory in the  case of four-dimensional non-singular
homogeneous plane wave with non-vanishing homogeneous NS-NS  three-form
field strength (and/or  a dilaton).  In particular, we find the
string spectrum explicitly for various special cases, including  the
anti-Mach model mm .  We also discuss  the explicit form of the
level matching condition and compute the zero-point energy part  of the
string Hamiltonian.


In appendix A, we summarise some facts about matrices with null vectors
and their minors which are relevant for solving string theory in a
homogeneous plane wave. In appendix B, we determine the closed string
canonical commutation relations.  In appendix C, we present a geometric
description of a degeneracy of the spectrum of some string models in
terms singularities of a hypersurface and an associated fibration. We
also compute the Berry connection of some quantum mechanical models
that arise in the context of strings in homogeneous plane waves and we
find that it vanishes.



Homogeneous plane wave backgrounds
 as  a subclass of pp-wave string-theory solutions 

pp-wave and plane wave backgrounds 



We shall begin with a review of a class of string
backgrounds with metrics admitting a covariantly constant null
Killing vector, and explain how the homogeneous plane waves discussed in
prt,mm  appear as  special cases. We shall also describe
the models that we shall focus on later in this paper.
Let us  start with the most general null Brinkmann metric
with flat transverse space
(for a review see, e.g., tcqg )If the
transverse metric is taken to be
, then   and  can be eliminated by
transforming   and ; this is no longer the case
  if we set 
 (see, e.g., ts93 ). 
 met 
ds^2 = 2 dudv  + K(u,x) du^2 + 2 A_i(u,x) dx^i du
+  dx^i dx^i  ,
where . This is the metric of a p lane-fronted wave ()
with p arallel rays ( is covariantly constant and null), or a pp-wave
for short.

String backgrounds (conformal sigma-models) with this metric may be
constructed  by switching on a combination of "null" p-form field
strengths and the dilaton.
For example, one can consider string backgrounds with metric (),
and non-vanishing  NS-NS 2-form
gauge potential  and dilaton
dil 
B_iu  = B_i(u,x)  ,            (u)  ,
respectively.
The one-loop sigma model conformal invariance conditions or,
equivalently, the common-sector supergravity field equations are
R_MN -14  H^R _ML  H^L _RN +2_M_N&=&0
_L(e^-2  H^L _MN ) &=&0  ,
tops 
where  and  is the NS-NS field strength, .

 For the pp-wave ansatz above, we find
-12  _i^2K+_u^i A_i
+14  F_ij  F^ij -
14  H_ij  H^ij 
+2^2_u &=&0
^iF_ij =0   ,
            ^i H_ij &=&0 ,
where 
and .
The  general solution of these equations
does not define an exact  conformal sigma model,
i.e. there will be non-trivial -corrections to the background fields.
However, all -corrections may be absent in some special cases
(like that of   in amat,hos ).

One such special  choice is
jjl 
 A_i= B_i  .
  It  leads to a chiral null model
hts  which is an exact string solution to all orders
in  provided the above 1-loop conditions,
eeew 
- _i^2 K + _u ^i A_i + 2 ^2 _u  ,
             ^i F_ij  =0  ,  
are satisfied.
Models with  
  can be interpreted
as WZW models for  non-semisimple groups NW .

All higher-loop corrections vanish also in another special
(now "non-chiral") case hor,duv,ts93 
jj 
 A_i = - F_ij (u)  x^j  ,       
B_i =  - H_ij (u)  x^j  , where the string sigma model conformal invariance conditions tops 
reduce to
coo 
- _i^2 K +
 F_ij  F_ij  - H_ij  H_ij   + 2 ^2 _u  . A simple special solution of the latter is
sep 
K=  K_ij (u) x^i x^j   ,       
K_ii  =
 F_ij  F_ij  - H_ij  H_ij   + 2 ^2_u  .
 For this choice of , the Brinkmann metric met 
is a plane wave,
 mpw 
ds^2 = 2 dudv  + K_ij (u) x^i x^j  du^2 + F_ij (u) x^i  dx^j du
+  dx^i dx^i  .
This metric is parametrised by a symmetric matrix 
and antisymmetric matrix .
However, there is a freedom of coordinate transformations that
in general  reduces
the amount of independent data to one symmetric   matrix
function of .

Indeed, we   can make  an   orthogonal 
 rotation
pop 
x^i = M^i_j(u) y^j  ,       _ij  M^i_k(u)  M^j_(u) = _k  that "absorbs"  into , giving
the plane wave metric in Brinkmann coordinates,
 opw 
ds^2 = 2 dudv  + K_ij (u) y^i y^j  du^2 +
dy^i dy^i  ,
where (a prime denotes a -derivative)
redd 
M'^i_j =   F_ik  M^k_j   ,       
K_ij  =  M^k_i M^l_j  (K_kl  -  1 4  F_kn  F_ln )
.
Note that  
which is in agreement with the expression for the Ricci tensor component
 in coo ,sep .
If  were constant, 
would  be -dependent even for a constant .
The  rotation pop  also affects the expression for
 in jj .

We can also  transform  the metric mpw  or opw 
to Rosen coordinates  
ros 
x^i = L^i_a(u) X^a  ,        
v= V  + s_ab  (u) X^a X^b     ,  getting
roo 
ds^2 = 2 du dV +  g_ab (u) dX^a dX^b    ,        
 g_ab  =  L^i_a(u)  L^i_b(u)   . Starting with opw , we  find roo   provided
s'_ab  + K_ij   L^i_a  L^j_b +  L'^i_a  L'^i_b =0
 ,     
 s_ab   +  L^i_(a  L'^i_b)  =0  ,    i.e.     
  L^i _a ^"  = K_ij    L^j_a   . For other aspects of the relation between Brinkmann and
Rosen coordinates for plane waves, see,  e.g.,  
the discussion in.


Homogeneous plane wave backgrounds 


Amongst the various conformal
plane wave backgrounds mpw  with ,
there are two special classes associated with the homogeneous
plane wave metrics of, namely
one 
I:      K_ij (u)=k_ij  =  ,      
F_ij (u) = 2f_ij = ,     
H_ij (u) = 2h_ij  = ,
two 
II:                   
K_ij (u) =1 u^2  k_ij    ,           
F_ij (u) = 2 u  f_ij    ,     
       H_ij (u) = 2 u  h_ij    .
The homogeneity of the plane wave metrics is not always respected
by the full string background. The
NS-NS fluxes are not homogeneous unless the matrices  and  commute,
.
The presence of a non-constant dilaton also breaks homogeneity. 
The metric of the class I background is smooth while that of the
class II background is singular, i.e. these
two classes can be distinguished as non-singular and singular homogeneous
plane wave backgrounds,  respectively.

According to redd , the   matrix   can
be associated with a coordinate rotation.
For that reason,  we shall sometimes call  a "rotation" matrix;
its other natural interpretation  (in the  gauge)
is as an effective magnetic field parameter ruts .

We can rewrite the metrics for  the two
backgrounds () and () in Brinkmann coordinates
opw  as
ds^2=2dudv+ (e^-fu  k e^fu )_ij  y^i y^j du^2+  dy^i dy^i    ,
metone 
ds^2=2dudv+ u^-2 (e^-fu   k e^fu )_ij  y^i y^j du^2+ dy^i dy^i
 , mettwo 
where , and
  , respectively.
Among all the metrics of the form (), these backgrounds are singled
out by the existence of an isometry with a non-trivial component in the 
-direction. In the "stationary" coordinates (), the corresponding
Killing vectors are simply  and  respectively.  

It is clear that if  commutes with , ,  the -dependent
rotation factors cancel out, i.e. we can simply absorb the dependence
on the matrix  into the shift .  This
transformation leaves the two-form NS gauge potential  invariant.
The  models of class I with  have been widely investigated in the
literature (see prt  for references and sadri  for a more recent
investigation of some particular models with ).

For generic matrices , there is still some redundancy in the
parametrisation of the backgrounds. In both cases  I and II, it is always
possible to diagonalise  with an  orthogonal transformation of
the coordinates . In addition, under the scaling transformation 
, the parameters of the models of class
I transform as ,  and . Thus
the eigenvalues of  should be specified up to a positive constant.
The remaining   symmetry ()  allows  one to determine
 up to a sign.

The scaling transformation  is
a symmetry of the models of class II. In fact, the presence of this
additional isometry is responsible for the homogeneity property of the
corresponding  metrics.  These models are parametrised by the eigenvalues
of  and the two skew-symmetric matrices .  Models with 
have been investigated  in prt  and models with  have been
considered in mm .

Our aim here is to investigate string theory on the
backgrounds () and () with   and .
In both cases, the sigma model conformal invariance condition ()
can be solved in terms of the dilaton to give
dio 
I:      u^2
dit 
II:      +  u
where
dim 
- (k^i _i- f_ij  f^ij +h_ij  h^ij ) 
and  and  are  arbitrary  integration constants.

An important condition on our models is
the requirement that the  string coupling 
be small for all values of .  In  the case I, we find that
this leads to the requirement
ooi 
0 .
For the models of class II with , small string coupling requires
that  and  for . A more detailed discussion of
this issue can be found in for a similar model  with .

The condition  ooi  is satisfied automatically
if  but  and : then
. Since in this case ,
we can perform a coordinate transformation to construct a model with
 and .Note that only a subclass of models
with  and 
can be constructed in this way because not every symmetric matrix
is the square of a skew-symmetric one.
Conversely, if  for some skew-symmetric
matrix  and , then after a coordinate transformation
such  model is  related to the one  with  and . 



Four-dimensional homogeneous plane waves
with rotation 


The simplest examples of homogeneous plane wave backgrounds
with rotation for which ,  and 
are  four-dimensional ones, where  and  are
 matrices.

The most general 4-d model of that type jj , ()
with parameter functions in one ,two 
has
od 
k_ij  =   diag (_1, _2  )   ,    
f_ij  =  _ij    ,    h_ij = _ij    .
If , then  and the rotation matrix
  can be set to zero
by  a coordinate transformation. 
For that reason we shall
focus on  the non-trivial case where

For models with constant dilaton, we have to restrict the parameters as
coon 
_1 + _2 =  2^2 -  2^2  .
We may instead set the 2-form NS-NS gauge potential  to zero
 and introduce a dilaton, i.e. consider the following models
 mood 
k_ij  = diag (_1, _2 )   ,    
f_ij  = _ij    ,    h_ij =0  ,
with the dilaton given by dio   or dit  with
kop 
  12 (_1 + _2) + ^2  .
 
Models with constant dilaton 


A subclass of models for which the dilaton  is constant
is found for   and  .
 For , the condition of
 implies (in both cases I and II) that
kkk 
k^i _i =  f_ij  f^ij   .
A  solution of () with constant parameters is
mah 
k_ij  =    diag (2^2, 0  )   ,    
f_ij  =  _ij   . The corresponding metric  is the anti-Mach metric (see mm  and section 4.2 below).
Here  can be set equal to 1 by a rescaling of  and .

A ten-dimensional  solution can be constructed by setting





This background
is characterised by an additional  symmetry
acting on the coordinates  in ().
To see this we can  write the transverse space as 
using the obvious complex structure defined by .
Each  acts as a holomorphic
isometry on each . The non-trivial element of  exchanges the
two  subspaces.


Let us also mention that it is straightforward  to construct
similar plane wave models containing in addition  null
R-R  background  field strengths.
The corresponding string models  can be solved using the GS formalism
in the  gauge, as was done in  mt,bmn,rt .
The effect of the R-R parameters on the metric (for constant dilaton) can
be taken into account by replacing  in sep 
(and thus  in coon ) by the sum of the squares of all null field strengths.





World-sheet fermionic couplings in the  gauge 



To generalise the discussion to the superstring case, we note
that the world-sheet (NSR)  fermions decouple  from the
function   of the  plane-wave  metric mpw  in the  gauge
  ().
In the presence of the NS-NS 2-form field, the coupling to the
functions  and  is (for details see, e.g., rt )
fer 
 L_F= ^i_L [ _ij  _- -  p_v (F_ij  -  H_ij  )]
^j_L + ^i_R [ _ij  _+ -  p_v  ( F_ij  + H_ij  )]
^j_R  . The   dependence on    can be eliminated
by a local  Lorentz  transformation (rotation of fermions)
as in redd . Indeed,
we can apply the coordinate transformation pop   to eliminate 
by transforming  into  redd  which will
not couple to the fermions.
Thus an equivalent fermionic Lagrangian is
ferm 
 L_F= ^i_L ( _ij  _-  +   p_v   H_ij  )
^j_L + ^i_R ( _ij  _+ -  p_v  H_ij  )
^j_R  . To conclude,   the    fermions do not couple to the  parameters of the
metric mpw  in the  gauge. This is consistent with the fact that
the fermions do not contribute to (1-loop)  conformal invariance conditions in this
case.

We can also apply another local Lorentz rotation
to get another equivalent action where the left-moving  fermions are free
frm 
 L_F= ^i_L   _- ^i_L + ^i_R ( _ij  _+ -  p_v  H_ij  ) ^j_R  . Similar  gauge actions are found in the Green-Schwarz approach.
For example, the analog of  ferm  is
gs 
 L_F= i S_L (
_- + 1 16  p_v H_ij  ^ij  ) S_L + i S_R ( _+
- 1 16  p_v  H_ij  ^ij  ) S_R  .
 
Solution of the four-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation 


In section 3 we will explain a general procedure for quantising particles
and strings in regular homogeneous plane wave backgrounds. The case of the
relativistic particle in four dimensions (two transverse dimensions) can
also be solved directly, and for comparison purposes we present this
solution here.

The quantisation of a relativistic particle  propagating in the
homogeneous non-singular plane wave background
ds^2=2dudv+ k_ij  x^i x^j du^2 + 2 f_ij x^i  dx^j du+ dx^i dx^i    ,
mmm 
leads to the  Klein-Gordon equation.
In general,  the  massive Klein-Gordon equation
  corresponding to  the metric
met  has the form
kg 
[2_u _v-K _v^2+(_i-A_i_v)^2  -
M^2](u,v,x) =0 .
When  and  do not depend on 
(as is the case for the  homogeneous plane wave
background) it is natural to  perform a Fourier transform in
the  coordinates,



Then  the equation kg  becomes the Schrodinger-type
 equation for
 
H -M^2 - p_u p_v,
where
hmmm 
H= -[(_i-i p_v A_i)^2+ p_v^2 K(x)]
may be interpreted as a non-relativistic Hamiltonian of a particle with charge
 coupled to a magnetic field   and moving in
a potential  . The light-cone
Hamiltonian is
H^(0) =-p_u = M^2 2p_v  + p_v^-1 H.
In the case of the homogeneous plane wave in four dimensions mood ,
we have




Setting  and , we get the Hamiltonian operator
hah 
H=-[(_x+ip_v y)^2+(_y-ip_v x)^2
+p_v^2(_1 x^2 +_2 y^2)].
This  is recognised as a Hamiltonian describing the dynamics  of a
non-relativistic charged  2-dimensional oscillator (with masses ,
frequencies  and charge ) coupled to a
constant magnetic field of strength . The solution of this problem
is well known (see, e.g.,  yonei  and references therein). Such a
Hamiltonian  can be related to a  standard  decoupled two-dimensional
harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian by a unitary transformation,
H= U(_1, _2) (H_1+H_2) U^+(_1, _2)  ,
where
uni 
U(_1, _2)=e^-i _1   x y 
e^-i _2
p_x p_y    ,    
      p_x = -i _x ,         p_y = - i _y  ,   and
hmm 
H_i= 12 m_i  p_i^2+ m_i2   ^2_i x^2_i .
The parameters   are
tat 
_1= -p_v  (_1-_2)+4  
 ,          
_2= - 2 p_v    ,
where
daa 
^2=(_1-_2)^2 -   8 ^2  (_1+_2)+16 ^4
= (4  ^2 - _1- _2 )^2 - 4 _1_2 .
The frequencies and masses  of the free harmonic oscillators are
, with
^2_1,2 = (4^2-_1-_2  ),
freq 
and
maas 
m_1,2 =2+_1-_24^2 .
We are assuming that  is real and positive and  that ;
otherwise the labels of the two frequencies  should  be interchanged
(for  we have ).  The above expressions
apply when  and  are finite. When the  are finite,
they can be eliminated by a canonical transformation generated by
, so the spectrum only depends on the sign of .
The situation when  or  requires special consideration.

We will rederive these frequencies in a different way in the next
section. We will also see that in the frequency basis  adopted there
(see section 3.2) the particle or string Hamiltonian is automatically a
sum of decoupled harmonic oscillators (section 3.6) without the need to
perform explicitly the counterpart of the above unitary transformation.
Various other features of this spectrum and its string mode counterpart
will be discussed in section 4.

 B_iu  = - h_ij  x^j .
The dilaton background does not enter the classical string equations of
motion but modifies the quantum stress tensor, so  the discussion below
will apply to cases of both constant and non-constant dilaton.

We shall denote the string embedding coordinates  associated
with the spacetime coordinates 
as . Choosing the orthogonal gauge for the world-sheet metric,
the standard sigma model Lagrangian
L=1 4MN  _+ X^M _- X^N
(we will set  in the following)
leads to the following  equations for  and :
_+_-U=0 ,
ueqn 
xxx 
-_+_-X_i+ ( f+h)_ij _-U _+X^j
+ ( f-h)_ij  _+U _-X^j+ k_ij X^j _+U _-U=0
 , where ,  .
The equation for   can solved
as ; after gauge fixing the world-sheet
conformal transformations by the  gauge this becomes
uuu  U=p_+ ^+    +p_-^-  .
In the case of non-compact -direction
(the case we shall consider below),
the condition of periodicity of 
in  implies that , i.e. .
In most of what follows, we shall set
pii 
p_+ =p_-= p_v   ,
except in some  equations below which for generality we write down
as if  and  were independent to allow for compact  in which case
 and  are quantised.



Substituting uuu  into the equation xxx  for , we find
-_+_-X_i+2 p_- (f+h)_ij  _+X^j
+ 2p_+ (f-h)_ij  _-X^j+4 p_+ p_- k_ij  X^j=0
while  can be expressed in terms of  using the equations
associated with the variation of the 2-d metric.

To solve (), we set
X^i = _n=- ^+  X_n^i() 
2in   ,             X^i_n = (X^i_-n )^*   ,
where  and  , which leads to



 +  4n i p_- (h_ij +f_ij ) X_n^j-4n i p_+ (-h_ij +f_ij ) X_n^j=0 .
timeqn 
Setting , this equation becomes
-X_n^i +  2 p_v f_ij  X_n^j + (p_v^2 k_ij -4 n^2_ij ) X_n^j
+ 4 in  p_v h_ij X_n^j=0.
For  this equation is that of a relativistic particle
and, as expected, the dependence on  drops out.

For the metrics of class II in two , the analogue of this equation is
-X_n^i +   2 p_v  f_ij  X_n^j +
(p_v^2 k_ij  + p_v f_ij  ^2 -4 n^2_ij ) X_n^j
+ 4 in  p_v   h_ij X_n^j=0.
For  and changing  to log    this is identical to
the equation of the relativistic particle in the metrics of class I.
For general () string modes, the class II metrics have two
easily analysable limits:
 
When  for any , the same
change of variables to logarithmic time  reduces these equations to
the same form as the particle case of class I,  containing, however,  an
interesting correction in the constant term proportional to .
This case can be studied using the same
methods that we develop below, and then this limit becomes the basis
for an expansion of the solution around .
When  all
 dependent terms go to zero and we find just a string in flat space.

In  the remainder of this paper we will concentrate exclusively on the
non-singular homogeneous plane wave solutions of class I.

As explained  above, without loss of generality we can assume that  is diagonal,
.
Also, from now on, to simplify the notation, we will set

The dependence
of any equation on  can be reinstated by scaling 
.


The Frequency Base ansatz 

The general method to solve  a system of  coupled second order
equations  like ddx 
is to rewrite it as a set of  first-order equations. This
first-order  matrix differential equation with constant
coefficients is then solved by exponentiating this matrix. In practice,
however, this is rather unwieldy.

Fortunately,  for generic values of the parameters appearing in () one
can use a much simpler procedure. Namely, to solve these equations,
one makes the ansatz
X^i_n = _J=1 ^2d  ^(n) _J  a^(n) _iJ i^(n) _J  ,
with the frequencies  and their eigen-directions 
to be determined.(At this stage the 's are redundant as they
could be absorbed into the . They
have been introduced here for later convenience, as they will be promoted
to operators upon quantisation. Their commutation relations will be
determined from the canonical commutation relations of the  and their
 conjugate momenta.) 


Plugging this into the differential equation (), one
obtains the matrix equation
 M_ik (^(n) _J,n) a^(n) _kJ 
=0,
where M_ik (,n) = (^2 + _i -4
n^2)_ik  + 2 i f_ik  + 4 in h_ik .
A necessary condition for finding a solution to this matrix
equation is that
M(,n)= 0.
 This
equation has  roots ,
, which are the frequencies entering the ansatz
(). If all the roots are found to be distinct, or if
equal roots are associated with linearly independent null
eigenvectors, then the frequency base ansatz is justified because
the expansion () then involves all the  linearly
independent solutions of the equation (). The degenerate
case when there are multiple roots associated with the same
eigenvector requires separate considerations. Unless stated
otherwise, in the following we will always assume that all the
roots are  distinct.

We will see below that in the generic case this frequency base ansatz
is very efficient, in particular, because in this basis the canonical
commutation relations and the string Hamiltonian will turn out to be
automatically diagonal (a sum of decoupled harmonic oscillators).

We also want to mention that,  in addition to the general  matrix method
and the frequency base ansatz,  there is also a third, in some sense,
 intermediate,
possibility:  to make the ansatz
X_n() = _n X_n(0)
with  being  some  matrix.
This leads to a quadratic matrix equation
for , and works well in certain simple cases. However, this method
is neither as general as the first one, nor as efficient as the second, and we
will not make use of it in the following.


Warm-up: four-dimensional plane waves 

Before explaining in general how to obtain the solutions for the string
modes, we illustrate the procedure in the case of four-dimensional homogeneous
plane waves. Various other properties of these four-dimensional plane waves
will be discussed in detail in section 4.

For two transverse dimensions, the matrix 
takes the form
mam 
M = ^2 + _1 - 4 n^2 2i+
4 i n  -2i-4in ^2 + _2 - 4n^2 
where we set  , 
in Mik .
Thus the equation for the roots (frequencies) is
^4 + (_1 + _2 - 4^2 - 8 n^2) ^2  - 16n + (_1-4n^2)(_2-4n^2)
- 16 n^2 ^2 = 0.
We see that this equation is invariant under .
In particular, the roots  for  come in pairs ,
and for each frequency  of the 'th string mode
there is a corresponding frequency  of the
'th mode.

For , this becomes a quadratic equation for ,
^4 + (_1 + _2 - 4^2) ^2  + _1_2 = 0,
with solutions(The frequencies
have been labelled in such a way that for  one finds the standard result
.) 
_1,2 ^2 = 1 2 (4^2-_1-_2) 1 2 (4^2-_1-_2)^2 - 4 _1_2 .
Note that these  are precisely the frequencies () obtained in
section 2.6 from the explicit diagonalisation of the particle Hamiltonian.
This will also be  verified later  when we compute the
Hamiltonian operator using the  classical solutions of
the system.

We obtain four distinct frequencies unless either
the discriminant  (given by the same expression as in daa )
^2=(4^2-_1-_2)^2 - 4 _1_2 ,
vanishes, or one has .

Similarly, for the string modes (),  and when either  or ,
one obtains a quadratic equation for . In the former
case the solutions can be obtained
from the solutions for  by shifting , so
that the frequencies are
fern 
(^(n) _J )^2 = 1 2 (4^2
 -_1-_2+ 8 n^2) 1 2 (4^2  -_1-_2+ 8 n^2)^2 - 4
(_1-4n^2)(_2-4n^2) .
In the latter case, we find that
hfo 
(^(n) _J )^2=1 2 (
 -_1-_2+ 8 n^2) 1 2 (_1-_2)^2 +64 n^2 h^2 .
 The squares of the frequencies are real for physical values of
the parameters.

In the general case with , the equation for the
frequencies is a quartic (with vanishing cubic term), whose roots can
of course be given in a closed (albeit complicated and unenlightning) form.

Having found the frequencies , we now need to determine  the
corresponding null eigenvectors .
These can readily be constructed explicitly on a case-by-case basis,
but there is also a general method  which we outline now (and which,
suitably interpreted, immediately generalises to the higher-dimensional
case). Namely, we observe that for any  matrix  with
vanishing determinant,
M_11 M_22 -M_21 M_12  = 0,
a possible choice for the corresponding null eigenvector  with
 is
(v_1,v_2)=(-M_22 ,M_21 ).
Indeed,  one then has
M_1k v_k  &=& - M = 0M_2k v_k  &=& -M_21 M_22  + M_22  M_21 = 0.
Therefore,  we can  choose the null eigenvectors 
to be, e.g.,
(a_1J ,a_2J )=(-M_22 (_J),M_21 (_J)).
This is an acceptable choice of null eigenvector unless
, in which case one can use
 instead. If  is identically
zero, obviously the construction of null eigenvectors in terms of matrix elements
of  fails. But the construction of (two linearly independent)
null eigendirections is trivial in this case.

We have now completely determined the frequency expansion ()
of the string modes, up to an overall scale encoded in the 's
parametrising the classical solutions.


The general classical solution 

We now discuss the construction of the solutions () in
the general case.
First of all, an important property of  in Mik 
is that
M^T (,n)= M(-,-n).
Thus  and 
have the same determinant and hence the same roots.
This means that for  the frequencies come in  pairs,
n=0:_J = _j,   j=1,,d,
as we had already seen in the four-dimensional case.
It is then convenient to rewrite the expansion of the zero-mode as
X^i_0 = _j=1 ^d   [^+ _j  a^+ _ij i_j  
+ ^- _j  a^- _ij -i_j   ].
For , on the other hand, we have
n0: _J^(-n)  = -_J^(n) ,
so that the -modes are paired. We will thus label the
frequencies  in such a way that
kopi 
_J^(-n)  =
- _J^(n)   ,         J=1,...,2d  .  Next,  we observe that the expression for the null eigenvectors we have found for
 can be written as
v_k = (-1)^k m_1k ,
where  is the minor  of , i.e.  the determinant
of the matrix obtained from  by removing the 'th row and 'th column. In
the  case, one  obviously has   and .

As we show in Appendix A.1, this way of writing the null eigenvector generalises
to arbitrary dimensions. Thus the eigen-directions  can for instance be
chosen to be
a_iJ ^(n)  = (-1)^i m_1i (_J^(n) ),
where   means the minor  of 
evaluated for . As in the case  discussed
above, this is an acceptable choice of null eigenvector unless all
the  evaluated at  are zero.  In that case,
instead of using the , one could of course also use the 
for any other value of . One can also use different  for different
frequencies, and generically all these choices are equivalent.

Because the minor of a transpose is the transpose of the minor, for 
one can choose
a_ij ^+  &=& (-1)^i m_1i (_j)a_ij ^-  &=& (-1)^i m_1i (-_j) = (-1)^i m_i1 (_j).
Similarly, for , one can choose the eigenvectors for  to be given
by the transposes of the minors for .

Thus the solutions for the string modes are, explicitly,
X^i_0 = (-1)^i_j=1 ^d 
 [^+ _j  m_1i (_j)i_j  
 + ^- _j  m_i1 (_j)-i_j  ],
for , and
X^i_n = (-1)^i _J=1 ^2d  ^(n) _J  m_1i (_J^(n) )
i^(n) _J  
for .



The canonical commutation relations 

We now promote the 's to operators and impose the canonical commutation
relations (CCRs)
&& [X^i(,),X^k([^i(,),^k(&& [X^i(,),^k(ik (where
_i= 1  (X_i  -  f_ij  X^j)
are the canonical momenta  that follow  from
the string sigma model Lagrangian () for the metric mou .
Note that the the momenta  do not depend on
the null NS three-form field strength   dil 
in the  gauge.
It is clear that in order to get time-independent CCRs, the only non-zero
commutators can be between  and  (for ) and
 and  for .
Let us call these
C_j &:=& [^-_j,^+_j] C^(n) _J &:=& [^(-n) _J ,^(n) _J ].
Note that obviously .
We will show in Appendix B that imposing the canonical commutation
relations determines the  and  uniquely to be
C_j  &=& 1 2 m_11 (_j)
_j_kj (_j^2-_k^2) C^(n) _J  &=& 1 m_11 (^(n) _J)
_KJ (^(n) _J-^(n) _K) .
We now need to relate the oscillators  with
 [_j^-,_k^+]=C_j_jk 
to canonically normalised operators  with
 [_j^-,_k^+]=_jk  .
Let us assume that the frequencies  are real  (and chosen to be positive).
Then the  are also real. Reality of the string modes requires that
(_j^+)^  = _j^-.
If  is positive, then one can define
_j^= _j^/C_j^1/2 for  C_j > 0 ,
with . If  is negative, the situation is somewhat
different. One could try to define .
Then () is satisfied, but the  are not  the hermitian
conjugates of each other. Rather, one should
note that  really means that
the creation operator  is associated with the negative  frequency
 and vice versa. In other words, one should define hermitian
conjugate operators by
_j^ = _j^ /C_j^1/2 for  C_j < 0.
With the choice (,), the bilinear 
is related to the number operator
N _j = _j^+_j^-
(with spectrum  on the Fock space defined by the vacuum annihilated
by ) by
1 2 (_j^+_j^- + _j^-_j^+) = C_j(N _j + 1 2 )
.
In the same way one can relate the  to canonically normalised
oscillators  with, say,
 [_J^(n) ,_K^(m) ] = -(n)_n+m,0 _JK ,
so that one has
1 2 (_J^(n) _J^(-n)  +_J^(-n) _J^(n) ) = C_J^(n) 
(N _J^(n)  + 1 2 )
with
N _J^(n)  = _J^(n) _J^(-n) .
Hence, putting everything together one now has a completely explicit string
mode expansion. All the data entering the mode expansion () in
this frequency basis for the solutions are determined by the matrix  in
Mik :
 
the frequencies are the roots of 
the eigen-directions of the frequencies are
constructed from the minors of 
the commutators of the 's are determined
by the frequencies.








The string Hamiltonian and its oscillator frequencies 

The light-cone Hamiltonian is(Note that written in terms of the
velocities  rather than the
momenta , the Hamiltonian does not
explicitly  depend  on . Recall also that we have set
, and .
) 
H = 1 2 _0 ^ d [ _ij (X ^i X ^j 
+ X^i X^j  - k_i X^i  X^j ) - 2 h_ij  X^i X^j  ]
Here primes indicate -derivatives.
Inserting the mode expansion smz ,smn 
for the , the Hamiltonian
becomes a bilinear expression
in the oscillators  and .
Since the light-cone Hamiltonian
for a smooth homogeneous plane wave in the stationary coordinates ()
is
time-independent, it follows that the only non-zero terms are those proportional
to the diagonal combinations  or .

The vanishing of the other contributions can
be expressed as certain identities about
roots and minors. While these are guaranteed to hold, by virtue of the
time independence of  light-cone Hamiltonian, in low dimensional cases
one can also verify them explicitly.(It might be desirable to have a
general proof of these identities
which does not  invoke reference to time-independence of the string
Hamiltonian. A
proof of one of the required identities can be found in Appendix A.2.) 


Because of the pairing of the  modes,  this Hamiltonian can be written as   a sum
huu 
H = _n=0 ^ H^(n)  .
The zero-mode part or particle Hamiltonian is
H^(0)  = 1 2  _i=1 ^d[(X _0^i)^2 - _i (X_0^i)^2]
.
Inserting the mode expansion () and
retaining only the terms proportional to , one finds
H^(0)  = 1 2 _j 
_i (_j^2 - _i)m_1i (_j) m_i1 (_j)
 (_j^+_j^- + _j^-_j^+) .
As the oscillators corresponding to different frequencies  commute,
 is a sum of  operators without  cross interactions.
We see that in the frequency basis the Hamiltonian is automatically diagonal,
and there is no need to perform explicitly the unitary transformation to diagonal
form, as was done in section 2.6.

When the frequencies  are real, the  are related to
standard oscillators in the manner described in the previous section and
the above Hamiltonian is a sum of harmonic oscillators. On the other hand,
when the frequencies are, say, imaginary, then the reality conditions
require not () but rather (assuming that the eigendirections
are real) . In this case the Hamiltonian
() also has the form of a harmonic oscillator one, but now with
imaginary frequencies, as can be seen by identifying the  up to
constants with hermitian operators . Similar considerations
apply in the case of complex frequencies.  From now on, unless stated
otherwise, we will assume that all frequencies are real.

Using () and the identity (), one finds that
the Hamiltonian takes the form
hze 
H^(0)  = ^d_j=1  (C_j)_j (N _j + 1 2 ),
where
_j = C_j m_11 (_j)_i (_j^2 - _i)m_ii (_j).
Here we have split , to keep track of the sign of the
spectrum - as we had seen, a negative  corresponds to an exchange of
positive and negative frequencies.

Using the expression for  obtained in (), one finds
_j = _i
(_j^2 - _i)m_ii (_j) 2_j_kj (_j^2-_k^2) 
.
We now claim that, despite appearance,
the result for   is actually very simple, namely
that (up to ) the oscillator frequencies of the  quantum string
Hamiltonian are equal to the frequencies of the classical string modes,
_j = _j,
This relation is easy to establish for four-dimensional plane waves,
i.e. .  We thus have two frequencies  and ,
and e.g.  is
_1&=&(_1^2 -_1)(_1^2 + _2)
+ (_1^2 -_2)(_1^2 + _1) 2_1(_1^2-_2^2)  &=&
(_1^4 - _1 _2) _1(_1^2-_2^2) 
=
(_1^4 - _1^2_2^2) _1(_1^2-_2^2) 
= _1,
where
_1 _2 = _1^2 _2^2
follows from the fact that  is the constant term in the
quadratic equation () for . Combined with the
explicit expression () for the classical frequencies, this
reproduces the result of section 2.6 based on explicit diagonalisation of
the Hamiltonian by a unitary transformation.

General validity of () is equivalent to the identity
_i (_j^2 - _i)m_ii (_j) = 2 _j^2 _kj (_j^2-
_k^2).
Using the same kind of manipulations as in the case , it is straightforward
to verify this identity directly for , and we certainly expect it to be true in
general. If this is the case, then this ought to be obvious on a priori
grounds.(This may be more apparent after doing this calculation in  phase space
variables.)  Note, however, that neither from the present point of view nor from
the analysis of section 2.6 this is completely manifest.  This is a
reflection of the non-diagonal nature of the original problem.

Likewise, for the string () modes, the
Hamiltonian takes the form
han 
H^(n) =^2d _J=1 (C_J^(n) )
_J^(n) (N _J^(n) +1 2 ),
where  is the sum of two terms - one coming from the metric,
the other from the -field,
 _J^(n)  = C_J^(n) m_11 (_J^(n) )
   _i,j  [((_J^(n) )^2 - _i + 4n^2)_ij 
   - 4 i n (-1)^i+j  h_ij ]m_ij (_J^(n) )  .
   The above expression for the frequencies can be simplified somewhat. Using
idd1 ,  hfre  can be rewritten as
_J^(n) =2 _J^(n)  C_J^(n) m_11 (_J^(n) )
   _i,j  [_J^(n)  _ij 
   + i  (-1)^i+j  f_ij ]m_ij (_J^(n) )  .
   As in the particle case (), we expect
the frequencies  to be exactly equal to the string mode frequencies,
bef 
_J^(n) = _J^(n) .
General validity of () is equivalent to the identity
2 _i,j  [_J^(n)  _ij 
   + i  (-1)^i+j  f_ij ]m_ij (_J^(n) )=_K(_J^(n) -_K^(n) ) 
   which can be verified for  after some computations which are explained
in section 4.4.



The level matching condition 


In general, the  Hamiltonian  should be supplemented by the
condition of translational invariance along the closed string,
i.e.
^_0  d  _i X'^i =0  ,
which should be imposed on the string spectrum.
Using the
definition () of the momenta  and the mode expansion
(), one finds that more explicitly this constraint takes the form
-2i_n>0 
n(:^i_n X^i _-n  - ^i _-n X^i _n :) = 0,
where  refers to the normal ordering prescription of the previous
section and
^i_n= (-1)^i  _J=1 ^2d 
_J^(n) [i_J^(n) _ik  - (-1)^i+k f_ik ]
m_1k (_J^(n) )i_J^(n)  .
The
constraint is time-independent, as can be checked by using the
equations of motion (). Hence we can drop all the
non-diagonal terms , , in
the expansion of the constraint as these would enter with
time-dependent phases.(Once again, vanishing of these contributions
can be rephrased as certain identities about roots and minors.)  
After some rearrangement, using the
identity (), we can write the level-matching constraint
in terms of the number operators  as
_n>0 2n _J=1 ^2d m_11 (_J^(n) ) C_J ^(n) 
_j,k=1 ^d[_J^(n) _jk +i(-1)^j+k f_jk ]
m_jk (_J^(n) ) N _J^(n) =0.
Using the
explicit expression () for the , we can
rewrite this condition as
_n>0  n_J=1 ^2d  S_J^(n) 
N _J^(n)  = 0 where
S_J^(n)  =
2(m_11 (_J^(n) ))
_j,k=1 ^d[_J^(n) _jk +i(-1)^j+k f_jk ]
m_jk (_J^(n) ) _KJ (_J^(n) -_K^(n) ) . Assuming the general validity of conid , we find that
S_J^(n)  = (m_11 (_J^(n) ))  (_KJ (_J^(n) -_K^(n) ))
and so
S_J^(n) =1.
Comparison of () and the expression for  ()
shows that
S_J^(n)  = (C_J^(n) ).
This means that the signs appearing in the string oscillator spectrum agree with
the signs in the level-matching condition.

In the four-dimensional case we will show in section 4.4
that typically (but not necessarily), and in particular for large ,
we have
S_J^(n) =(_J^(n) ),
as might have naively been expected for the level-matching condition.
In particular, therefore, for large  the string Hamiltonian is a sum
of harmonic oscillators with positive frequencies
(C_J^(n) )_J^(n) =_J^(n) .
However for small  (small compared to  , measured in units of ),
there may be deviations from this and both the Hamiltonian and the level-matching
conditions may involve some unusual signs.




Aspects of the string spectrum for four-dimensional plane waves 



In the previous sections we have shown that, generically, the particle
Hamiltonian in a homogeneous plane wave background takes the form of
a set of decoupled harmonic oscillators, with real or possibly
complex frequencies.  In the following, we will analyse
various aspects of the resulting particle and string spectra in the case
of four-dimensional plane waves.


Analysis of the particle spectrum 

In the particle case we found that  the frequencies, masses and oscillator
commutators cjcj  are (see freq ,fbf  for the frequencies)
daan 
_1,2 ^2 = 1 2 (4^2-_1-_2 ) ,
        ^2=(4^2-_1-_2)^2 - 4 _1_2   , m_1,2  =  2 +_1-_24^2   ,       
C_1,2  = 1 2_1,2 (_1,2 ^2+_2) .
We see that when , so that ,
the masses  vanish and correspondingly the  are infinite.
This can happen only if  and  are both positive and 
.  In that  case  the unitary
transformation  uni  which related the original system to the system
of two decoupled  harmonic oscillators breaks down because the phase
 becomes infinite.
One of the  will also be infinite when one of the frequencies is
zero. This implies that one of the  is zero and that one of the
masses  is infinite.

When there is no rotation, , the frequencies are 
, with masses . We see that in this case one of the 
would blow up, but this is due to the fact that
the minors  so that
this is simply a reflection of a bad choice of a  null eigen-direction, which
can be fixed by choosing different null vectors
for different frequencies (see the discussion following ()).

Assuming that both frequencies  are non-zero and  real (we
shall always assume that if the  are real they are chosen to
be  positive), the Hilbert space of the theory is that of two harmonic
oscillators with generically different frequencies.  The spectrum of
the Hamiltonian  is given by the (almost) standard oscillator
expression
spee 
_1 (n_1+)_2 (n_2+)   ,
where . As explained in section 2.6 and section 3.6,
the sign of the spectrum depends on the sign of the  or . We
will come back to this issue below.

One finds that     are positive if, e.g.,  
(then ).  If , then the frequencies
 are  positive  provided .
If the signs of  and  are different, then
  and
thus the  oscillator system is unstable in
 one direction.

Let us now take into account the conditions (see section 2.3)
on the parameters
 and 
imposed by the conformal invariance conditions (i.e. by the Einstein equations).
First, in  the pure-metric case
(constant dilaton and zero 3-form strength)
with vanishing rotation parameter ,
the Ricci-flatness implies that
rel 
 _1+ _2 =0  ,     i.e.        _1 - _2   ,   
  ^2_1= - _1    ,         ^2_2 = - _2   ,       m_1,2 =1  .  Thus  one of the  frequencies  is
necessarily imaginary, and we  get  an inverted
oscillator problem in one of the two directions: the
absence of a  stable ground state  just means that
the particle  "escapes" to infinity (the classical
geodesics are  also  "pushed" to infinity).
 As in the standard plane wave cases
 discussed in marol ,  the negative values of the  gauge
 energies  do not of course imply any real instability
 of the plane wave background  but are rather related to
  the fact that
 some geodesics may escape to infinity. 

For metrics with
 the Ricci-flatness condition  implies that (cf. coon )
pul 
 _1+ _2 = 2 ^2  ,   
i.e.         _1 - _2
  ,       
^2_1    = _2    ,    
^2_2    = _1   ,    m_1  = - _1 - _2  2 _2

  _1 - _2  2_1  
   .
Compared to rel   here     and 
are multiplied by -1  and their absolute values are interchanged.
It appears as if the  role of the rotation parameter  is thus to
reverse
the signs  of the two frequencies compared to the  case, i.e.
one is tempted to
conclude that (like in the case of
non-Ricci-flat  plane waves with extra fluxes)
the  Ricci-flat plane waves with non-zero 
rotation parameter
  may have  localised   point-like particle dynamics
in transverse directions
(both at the classical and quantum level):
if   and  are  positive,
the particle is described by an effective Hamiltonian  of
two decoupled oscillators with real  frequencies.

For generic non-vanishing 
one of the two masses in hmm  is negative.
That means that one of the effective oscillator
Hamiltonians  enters their sum  with the negative sign,
and thus one of the two oscillator  energy spectrum terms in
spee   should be taken with  the negative sign.
This is not surprising given that for positive  and 
the original Hamiltonian hah  is not positive definite, and
can also be understood from the fact that 
is possible iff ,
so that the role of positive and negative frequencies is interchanged (see section
3.5). Thus we  are in a novel situation  where the
  energy spectrum is discrete
but not positive,
spen 
- _1 (n_1+) +_2 (n_2+)  .

As it is clear from  sep ,coon , the role of the  3-form or
the  -parameter is to effectively reduce the value
 of : for non-zero  we have
   and thus
^2_1,2  = ^2 + ^2   ,
            ^2 = (_1 - _2)^2  + 16 ^2 ^2  .
Depending on the value of
   both  frequencies may be  real or one of them
may be imaginary. In particular, in
the chiral null model case
with an additional  symmetry in -directions,
i.e. for     and  ,
we get  ,  i.e.
we get again the Landau-type  spectrum, in agreement with
ruts .

In the case of a non-trivial  (-dependent) dilatonic background,
the dilaton can be eliminated from the Klein-Gordon
 equation
by a redefinition 
of the field  in kg  (see prt  for details). For a non-constant  dilaton
given by the  case I of dio  the positivity ooi 
of the parameter  in dim  or kop 
implies   the restriction .
Interestingly, the  latter
condition ensures also the reality of  in daan .





The anti-Mach metric 

A border-line case is when one of the  parameters  or 
vanishes. This corresponds to the anti-Mach metric  discussed in mm .
If we choose,   as  in mah ,
,
we get
rees 
 ^2_1  = 0 ,         ^2_2= 2 ^2   ,
        m_1 = -,  m_2 =  . In this case  the phases  tat  are
.

The vanishing of one of the frequencies suggests that the spectrum
 should contain a discrete oscillator contribution  in one
direction and a continuous  free-particle contribution in another,
in agreement  with the previous analysis of mm .
However, since here  one of the effective masses is infinite,  this
case needs special consideration.

In this conclusion was reached by noting that the
coordinate transformation
v v + 2xy
puts the anti-Mach metric (which corresponds to the choice of the parameters
())
ds^2 = 2 dudv + 2 ^2 x^2 du^2 + 2 (x dy - ydx) du + dx^2 + dy^2
into the form
ds^2 = 2 du dv + 2 ^2 x^2 du^2  + 4 x dy du + dx^2 + dy^2.
In this coordinate system, there is clearly a translation invariance in the
-direction which gives rise to a continuous contribution to the spectrum.

This coordinate transformation can be equivalently regarded
as a gauge transformation
of the gauge field  in met . Thus, to make the discussion of the  case
more transparent,  it is useful to follow
the analysis  of the Landau problem in
a different gauge for  than used in  jj ,one ,od , namely,
A_x = 0  ,         A_y = 2 x  .  Then   the Hamiltonian hmmm  takes the following form
(cf. hah )
hih 
H=-[_x^2+(_y-2i x)^2 +_1 x^2 ]  .
The case  corresponds to the standard Landau problem,
and the case of  to the anti-Mach metric  case.
Since  is a symmetry,
we may  use the Fourier transformation in ,
i.e. .  Then
hoh 
H=-_x^2  + V   ,      
V = [ (2 x - p_y)^2  -  _1 x^2 ]  .
The potential here is positive at large  both in the Landau model case 
and in the anti-Mach case .
In the Landau model case  we can  "absorb"  into   by a constant shift
and thus the resulting spectrum is the discrete spectrum of a one-dimensional
harmonic oscillator with  mass 1 and frequency .
In the anti-Mach case we get, diagonalising the quadratic form
in the potential,
popi 
V = [ (2 x - p_y)^2  -  _1 x^2 ]
=  (x - p_y)^2  -  p_y^2    .
The resulting analog of the spectrum  spee 
is indeed continuous but is not   positive definite (cf. spee ):
sos 
 _2 (n_2+) - p^2_y   ,            
_2=  2    .    This is, indeed, in agreement  with the spectrum found in mm .
As expected on the basis of  one of the two  effective masses going
to minus infinity as the frequency goes to zero in rees , here the
free-motion contribution enters with negative sign relative
to the mass term.
This is the opposite to what happens in the flat space limit where
(for
) one has
. This result
 is  obviously a reflection of an
inherent "unboundedness"  of trajectories in this
 case - the  energy
can take any possible negative values.

It is clear now that similar features are shared by the general case
of non-zero  where  again one of the masses is negative: there,
as explained above (see spen ),  the negative contribution to
 the 
spectrum is not continuous as in the anti-Mach case but discrete.


Analysis of the string spectrum 

The string mode frequencies are the roots of the equation (),
^4 + (_1 + _2 - 4^2 - 8 n^2) ^2  - 16n + (_1-4n^2)(_2-4n^2)
- 16 n^2 ^2 = 0.
In general the roots , , of this equation satisfy
the identities
_J=1 ^4 _J^(n) &=&0, 

_J<K  ^(n) _J^(n) _K &=& _1 + _2 - 4^2 - 8 n^2 , 


_J<K<L ^(n) _J^(n) _K^(n) _L &=& 16 n  , 


^(n) _1 ^(n) _2 ^(n) _3 ^(n) _4&=&(_1-4n^2)(_2-4n^2)
- 16 n^2 ^2
.
Note that for large , the product of the roots is positive. Since the sum of the
roots is zero, this means that for sufficiently large  there will be two
positive and two negative frequencies.

When , eq. 4droots2  is a quadratic equation for  and the
frequencies fern  are
^(n)2 _1,2   = 1 2 (4^2
+ 8 n^2 -_1-_2 _n) ,
where
_n^2&=& (4^2 + 8 n^2 -_1-_2)^2 - 4 (_1-4n^2)(_2-4n^2)
&=&
(_1-_2)^2-8(_1 + _2)^2 + 16 ^4 + 64 ^2 n^2.
We see that, regardless of the values of  and , the
frequencies are real for large enough values of ,
i.e. both the "rotation" or "magnetic" parameter 
and  the string  excitation level   work towards
stabilising the string motion.

A simple example is , which satisfies the Ricci flatness
condition (). In this case, , and the four
distinct real frequencies are
_J^(n) =2n.
An interesting possibility in the case when the particle motion is unstable
is to get new string states that have (nearly) zero frequencies,
i.e. new light states.
For example, in the case of the anti-Mach metric () with
parameters (), , we find
^(n)2 _1,2   = ^2 + 4n^2 ^4 + 16 ^2 n^2  .
For the zero mode ()  we reproduce the result rees  mm 
of the point-particle analysis that one of the two frequencies vanishes.
Clearly,   is always real.
, on the other hand, can be real, zero, or imaginary.
In fact, for the special values , the frequency vanishes,
and one has a new massless state. For  the frequency is
imaginary, i.e. for fixed  for sufficiently large  all
frequencies are real and the motion is oscillatory.

Note that  compared to the  homogeneous  R-R plane wave  model  in
mt  where the spectrum had the form  
  (with  determined by the R-R flux)
here we have  more intricate ("double square root")
dependence on the oscillator level .  Similar string oscillator
spectra were found previously in the case of "standard" (no rotation)
plane waves supported by a null  (and non-constant,
)    background in war .  One may thus contemplate possible
connection to deformations of conformal gauge theories via Penrose limits
of the corresponding geometries (cf. prez ).


When , the parameter   appears only in the constant term and one has
^(n)2 _J  = 1 2 (8 n^2 -_1-_2) 1 2 (_1-_2)^2 + 64 n^2 ^2 .
In particular, when  and 
(so that coon  is satisfied for
 constant dilaton), one can take  the square root
 and the frequencies are (cf. ())
hop 
^(n) _J  =  (2n ).
Here for special values of  one finds additional
states with zero  energy.
This case (related by a coordinate transformation
to a WZW NW  or chiral null model case)
was considered previously in ruts,bmn,rt .


In general, when  and , the frequencies are complicated
functions of the parameters. We can write the defining equation ()
as
jok 
(^2 - 4 n^2 + _1)(^2 - 4 n^2 + _2)=
4(+ 2n )^2
.
Eq. jok  simplifies in the case ,
when the four roots are the solutions of the
two quadratic equations
^2 - 4 n^2 + = (2+ 4 n),
namely
_1,2  &=& ^2 + 4 n^2 - + 4 n _3,4  &=& -^2 + 4 n^2 - - 4 n 
Let us now consider the chiral null
model case  (cf. ruts,rt ).
With  and , the
conformal invariance condition coon   
 implies that
 , so that the four frequencies are thus
simply (cf. hop )
_1,4 ^(n) =2(n),_2^(n) =_3^(n) =-2n .
 Note  that the matrix 
in mam 
evaluated at
 is identically zero.
Therefore,  it has
two linearly independent null eigen-directions, and so
the frequency base ansatz
() provides us with  the full set of four linearly independent solutions,
even though two of the frequencies are equal (and the construction of the null
eigendirections in terms of the minors of  is not applicable).


The level matching condition 



In section 3.7 we had derived the general level matching condition (),
kopp 
_n>0  n_J=1 ^2d  S_J^(n)  N _J^(n)  = 0
where
S_J^(n)  =
2(m_11 (_J^(n) ))
_j,k=1 ^d[_J^(n) _jk +i(-1)^j+k f_jk ]
m_jk (_J^(n) ) _KJ (_J^(n) -_K^(n) ) .
To evaluate this in the present case of four-dimensional plane waves,
it is cumbersome (and unnecessary) to use the explicit expressions for the
roots. Rather, we will use the general identities (-) 
satisfied by the
roots of any quartic equation (with zero cubic term).

It follows from the form of the matrix  () that
_j,k=1 ^d[_J^(n) _jk +i(-1)^j+k f_jk ] m_jk (_J^(n) )
= _J ^(n) (2_J ^(n)2  - 8 n^2 + _1 + _2 - 4 ^2) - 8n.
Using the quadratic and cubic identities (,), 
we can write this as
()=
_J ^(n) (2_J ^(n)2 +_K<L ^(n) _K^(n) _L)
-1 2 _K<L<M _K ^(n) _L ^(n) _M ^(n) .
Using the linear identity (), we can write
2_J ^(n)2 =1 2  _J ^(n)2 -3 2 _J ^(n) 
_KJ  _K ^(n) .
Then one finds that the r.h.s. of () becomes
1 2 _KJ (_J ^(n) -_K ^(n) ).
This has two immediate consequences. First of all, it establishes the 
identity () ensuring that, in the four-dimensional case, 
we indeed have equality of the string mode and oscillator frequencies,
. Furthermore, the same identity now 
implies (as anticipated in section 3.7) that
S_J^(n) =(m_11 (_J ^(n) ))(_KJ (_J ^(n) -_K ^(n) )) = 1.
For example, in the case , it is now easy to see that
S_J^(n) =(_J ^(n) ),
so that kopp  becomes the same as
the standard flat space level-matching condition.

To show that this is not necessarily the case when , it suffices
to consider the example , , with spectrum
 (). In this case one finds
S_J^(n) =(2n).
Evidently this agrees with  for sufficiently large values
of , , but deviates from this for  (recall that we
have set  - in general the condition is , which for any
 can be violated for sufficiently large ).

To show this more generally  consider the case  where two of the
frequencies are positive  and the other two 
are negative. We also assume that  (this reduces to the inequality
 in the above example).  We order  the frequencies as
. The polynomial 
which has the frequencies as roots 4droots2  is positive for 
. In addition as it can be seen from jok , it takes
negative values at  and .
 Therefore there is at least one root between  and .
 Since  is the largest root,
  _J1  (_1^(n) -_J^(n) )>0
  and
 _1^(n) >-k_2+4n^2  ,
which imply that .
Similarly, it can be shown that 
by observing that  and so
.
It remains to show the statement for the other two frequencies
 and . There are two possibilities,
either  or .
We exclude the former case. If , then
 has to have another positive root which is larger than .
If it did not, the value of  at  would have
been positive.
However this is not the case as we have shown. But we have two positive and two
negative frequencies, so we have to take .
In this case, it is easy to see that
. Similarly, we can show that
.


When there are three positive frequencies and one negative, the formula
 is not valid as can be seen by an
argument similar to the above. However, since we have seen that for
sufficiently large values of  there are precisely two positive and
two negative frequencies, this establishes that typically, and for large ,
we indeed have .




The zero-point energy 


It follows from (,) that the zero-point energy or
normal ordering constant  has the form
noo 
_0 = 1 2 _j=1 ^d (C_j)_j
+ _n=1 ^ s_n,
where
s_n= 1 2 _J=1 ^2d (C^(n) _J)_J^(n)  - 2dn.
In    we have included the contribution  
of  the superstring fermions  which are decoupled from
the background in the  gauge (see section 2.5).

We had already seen that, for large , 
, so that for sufficiently large oscillator number the
contribution to the zero-point energy is given by the sum of the absolute
values of the frequencies,
s_n = 1 2 _J=1 ^2d _J^(n)  - 2dn.
In particular, for  and  or  the four frequencies

come in two pairs , so that
for sufficiently large  we have
s_n = ^(n) _1+^(n) _2 - 4n.
To estimate , one can expand  at large .
For example, for  one can use
(^(n) _1+^(n) _2)^2 &=&
^(n)2 _1 +^(n)2 _2 + 2(^(n)2 _1 ^(n)2 _2)^1/2 &=&
4 ^2 + 8 n^2 - _1 - _2 +
((_1-4n^2)(_2-4n^2))^1/2 .
Then one sees that the leading order  contribution
cancels against
that of the fermions, and that the lower order terms are
s_n = - 1 4  n   ( _1 +  _2 - 2^2  )
 -  1 64 n^3   
 [  _1^2 + _2^2   - 2 ^2 (_1 +  _2) + 2 ^4 ]
   + O (  1 n^5  )   .
The first term  here leads to a logarithmic divergence after summing over :
 =.
Its coefficient  
vanishes automatically  for the Ricci-flat spaces (cf. coo , kop )
or otherwise is cancelled by the dilaton contribution dio ,kop 
as in the similar dilatonic background case considered in prt .
The resulting  expression for  is thus finite,
in agreement  with  conformal invariance of the
theory before  gauge fixing.  This provides a useful check of the above
expressions for the frequencies.

For example, in the anti-Mach case anti  we find:
s_n = -  ^432 n^3 
 -  ^6128 n^5   -  ^88192 n^7  + O (  1 n^9 )
 , and  is automatically finite (and negative).
The negative vacuum energy  is analogous to the case of
prt  or zaff ; the sum can be evaluated using Epstein function as in
zaff .

Likewise, when  but , one finds
s_n = -1 4 n (_1 + _2 + 2^2) + O (1 n^3 ),
so that the logarithmic divergence in the sum noo 
is again absent when the conformal invariance condition
() is satisfied.

This fact, and  a somewhat surprising stronger statement, are true
for general values of  and . Even though the closed form
solution of () is unenlightning, we can find the explicit solution
of jok  in a series expansion in . It is clear that the leading behaviour
of  at large  is its flat space value
. Then, expanding
^(n)  = 2n + a + bn  + cn^2  + O (1n^3 ),
one finds
a&=& (+ ) , b&=&1 8 (2^2 - 2^2 - _1 -_2) ,  c&=&1 16 (2^2 - 2^2 - _1 -_2) (_1-_2)^2 128(+) .
If we now impose the conformal invariance condition  (), i.e.
, we obtain the simple expression
^(n)  = 2n (+) (_1-_2)^2 128 n^2(+)  + O (1 n^3 ).
Likewise, noting that () is invariant under  and ,
the other two frequencies are
^(n)  = -2n ((_1-_2)^2 128 n^2(+ O (1 n^3 ).
We conclude that
the logarithmic divergence in the sum over  is absent
for each series of  the frequencies 
independently  of  .

Some facts about minors 


Null vectors and minors 

Let  be a  matrix and let
 denote the minor of , i.e. the determinant of the matrix one
obtains from  by removing the 'th row and 'th column. These minors
satisfy the equations
_k M_ik  m_ik  (-1)^i+k  = M
for any . Moreover, for any  one has the identities
_k M_lk  m_ik  (-1)^k = 0 for  l i.
This can be shown by noting that, whatever  may be, the left-hand side
also calculates the determinant of a matrix with two equal rows, namely the determinant
of the matrix one obtains from  by replacing  by . The determinant
of this new matrix is clearly zero and the identity follows.

In particular, therefore, when , one can choose the
null eigenvector , , to be
v_k^(i)  = (-1)^k m_ik 
for any . If there are no degeneracies, there should be a unique null
eigen-direction. Hence the vectors  for different choices of  should be
proportional to each other, i.e.
v_k^(i)  v_k^(j)   =v_l^(i)  v_l^(j)  .
This can be rephrased as the useful identity
m_ik  m_jl  = m_il  m_jk ,
which is obviously true for  or  and
is indeed a property of matrices with  for 
because of the general identity
m_ik  m_jl  - m_il  m_jk  =  m_ij,kl  M ,
where  is the secondary minor obtained by removing the two rows
and columns indicated. 

Another useful identity can be obtained by using the explicit form
of the matrix . 
Let  be one of the roots of , where  is
given in Mik . Evaluating () at 
and summing over , we get
_i,k  M_ik  m_ik  (-1)^k+i =0 .
Substituting the expression for  Mik , we find
_i  ( (^(n) _J)^2+k_i-4n^2) m_ii (_J^(n) )&+&
2i _J^(n)  _i,k  (-1)^i+k  f_ik  m_ik (_J^(n) )
&+&4in _i,k  (-1)^i+k  h_ik  m_ik (_J^(n) )=0 .
Another identity for minors 

The general structure of the particle light-cone Hamiltonian
(before normal ordering) is
H^(0)  = _j,k=1 ^d _,=  _j^_k^H^ (_j,_k) i(_j + _k) 
where
H^ (_j,_k)= - 1 2 _i
(_i + _j_k)m_1i (_j)m_1i (_k)
.
Since in stationary coordinates the Hamiltonian is time-independent, it must be
true for instance that
H^++ (_j,_j)_i (_j^2 + _i)m_1i (_j)m_1i (_j)=0j .
Noting that  is just the -component of ,
we can also write this as
_i=1 ^d M_ii (_j)m_1i (_j)m_1i (_j)=0j .Here is a general proof of () which only makes use of the two elementary
identities (),(), which we will use in the form
M_11 m_11 =_i=2 ^d (-1)^i M_1i m_1i 
and
&&_k=1 ^d (-1)^k M_ik  m_1k  = 0 i1&& (-1)^1 M_i1 m_11  + (-1)^i M_ii m_1i  = - _ki,k1  (-1)^k
M_ik  m_1k .
Then, using the antisymmetry of  for , we can write
_i=1 ^d M_ii m_1i m_1i  &=& m_11  _i=2 ^d (-1)^i M_1i m_1i 
+ _i=2 ^d M_ii m_1i m_1i &=&
_i=2 ^d m_1i (M_ii m_1i  - (-1)^i M_i1 m_11 ) &=&
_i=2 ^d m_1i (-1)^i ((-1)^i M_ii m_1i  - M_i1 m_11 ) &=&
-_i=2 ^d _ki,k=2 ^m (-1)^i+k M_ik m_1i m_1k &=& 0.
The commutation relations of the 's 

Imposing the canonical commutation relations 


Beginning with the string mode expansion (),(),
we now promote the 's to operators and impose the CCRs
&& [X^i(,),X^k([^i(,),^k(&& [X^i(,),^k(ik (where
(1  _n=- ^+ 
2in(It will actually be sufficient to just impose the conditions
&& [X^i(,),X^k(0&& [X ^i(,),X^k(ik (the rest following from the definition of the  in Pi 
and the equations of motion.

In terms of the diagonal commutators  and  defined in (),
the CCRs become, for the zero mode,
&&_j=1 ^d C_j
(m_1i (_j)m_k1 (_j)-m_1k (_j)m_i1 (_j))=0&&_j=1 ^d C_j _j
(m_1i (_j)m_k1 (_j)+m_1k (_j)m_i1 (_j))
= _ik .
Now we can make use of the identity () to rewrite
m_1i m_k1 m_1k m_i1  = m_11  (m_ki m_ik ).
Thus the conditions become
&&_j=1 ^d C_j m_11 (_j)
(m_ki (_j)-m_ik (_j))=0&&_j=1 ^d C_j _j m_11 (_j)
(m_ki (_j)+m_ik (_j))= _ik .
Similarly, for the string modes one obtains the conditions
&&_J=1 ^2d  C_J^(n)  m_11 (_J^(n) ) m_ik (_J^(n) )=0&&_J=1 ^2d  C_J^(n)  _J^(n)  m_11 (_J^(n) )
m_ik (_J^(n) )= _ik .

Determining the  using the Vandermonde and Lagrange polynomials 

We now explain how to determine the solutions to the equations
(),() for the coefficients  and .
At first sight,  there appear to be too many equations for the  ()
coefficients  (). However, a closer inspection of the minors
reveals that all of these are satisfied provided that these coefficients
satisfy  () conditions - thus the  and  are uniquely
determined by these equations.  The structure of the equations is
slightly different for the zero-modes and the string modes, so we will
discuss them separately, starting with the latter.

The key observation is that the highest power of  that
can appear in any minor of a matrix  of the form () is
, arising from the product of  diagonal entries. Such
a term can only arise for a diagonal minor . Furthermore,
the coefficient of  in such a minor is 1 for any one
of the . Moreover,  only arises in the commutator
. All other commutators will involve off-diagonal
minors and hence lower powers of ,  with 
, and all these powers will appear. Hence all the 
equations () are satisfied provided that the  coefficients
 satisfy the  equations
&&_J=1 ^2d  C_J m_11 (_J)_J^i = 0
for i=0,,2d-2&&_J=1 ^2d  C_J m_11 (_J)_J^2d-1  = 1,
the extra power of  in the last equation arising from the additional
 in the second equation of (). These equations are solved by
C_J  =1 m_11 (_J)_KJ (_J-_K) .
One way to see that this is the solution is to use the Vandermonde matrix
and its inverse, expressed in terms of Lagrange polynomials.

Let ,  be  distinct
real or complex numbers. The Lagrange polynomials
 are defined by
P_i(x) = _ki  (x-x_k) (x_i-x_k) .
They clearly satisfy
P_i(x_k) = _ik .
Expanding the degree  Lagrange polynomials as
P_i(x) = _l=0 ^p-1 P_il x^l,
the above identity can be written as
P_il x_k^l = _ik .
In other words,  are the components of the matrix inverse to
the matrix  with components
V_lk  = x_k^l.
This is just the Vandermonde matrix, and hence the coefficients of the Lagrange
polynomials give the inverse of the Vandermonde matrix. In particular,
P_i,p-1 = 1 _ki  (x_i-x_k) .
Thus, going back to our
problem of determining the , the defining equations can be written as
V_LJ C_Jm_11 (_J) = _L,2d-1 ,
and therefore the solution is
C_J m_11 (_J)= P_J,2d-1 
= 1 _KJ (_J-_K) ,
as claimed.

For the zero-modes, the situation is slightly different.
 First of all, it follows
from the symmetry properties of the matrix   that
in this case  
has to be an even function of , and  an odd function of
. Hence the equations () only involve odd powers of . Once
again, the highest power that can appear is  and it is these
terms that should give the non-vanishing term  for , whereas all
other odd powers should sum to zero to satisfy the remaining equations. Thus the
 conditions on  coefficients  are
&&_j=1 ^d  C_j m_11 (_j)_j^2i-1  = 0
for i=1,,d-1&&_j=1 ^d  C_j m_11 (_j)_j^2d-1  = 1 2 .
These equations are solved, in the same way as above, by
C_j  =
1 2 m_11 (_j)_j_kj (_j^2-_k^2) .
Geometric Aspects of the Spectrum 
The spectral hypersurface 

As we have seen,  the frequencies of the string are given
by the  vanishing condition detcon  of the determinant of the matrix .
This condition can be viewed as defining a hypersurface  in the space
of parameters and frequencies. For a generic choice
of parameters, the hypersurface  is smooth.
Here we shall determine the values of the parameters
(and thus the corresponding plane-wave models)
which correspond
to  the singularities of this hypersurface.
The  singularities of
the hypersurface  are determined from the condition
that the first differential
of eq. detcon  with respect to the frequency 
and the parameters  and  vanishes on .

We shall consider
string theory on the four-dimensional plane wave for which  in
detcon  is given in mam . In this case  is a hypersurface
in ; we shall take the frequencies to be real but
the analysis can be easily extended  to  complex frequencies.
 For , we set  and find
that the first differential of det is
(2x + _1 +_2-4^2) dx+(x+_2) d_1+(x+_1) d_2-8xd .
The vanishing condition for this differential gives
_1=_2 ,       ,           ^2=-_1 .
Generically,  mam  has four distinct solutions for
 the frequency .
The model at the singularity has only two distinct frequencies
 (for ).
Thus  the singularity occurs at a model with
degenerate frequencies. However,
the singularity does not describe all models with degenerate frequencies.
Next, let us take ;  in this case the hypersurface  is singular
at
^3+12  (_1+_2-4^2-8n^2)+2 n,         _1=_2 ,
         ^2&=&4n^2-_1   .
There is another equation which is implied by  the above.
There are two cases to consider. If , then  and the
frequencies are given by  ().
If , then
n ^-1  ,       4n^2^2+(_1-4n^2)^2=0 .
Since for  we expect  generically  four distinct frequencies, the
singularity occurs at model with degenerate frequencies.

To describe all the models with degenerate frequencies by singularities,
we should consider
 as a fibration over the space of parameters. For strings in four-dimensional
plane waves,  should be thought of as a fibration over  spanned by
the parameters . The projection is the standard
projection of  onto  restricted on . The generic fibre
of such fibration has four points, the roots of the polynomial mam .
It is clear now that  as a fibration degenerates precisely when
two or more roots become equal. Thus at the singularities of this
fibration are the models with two or more degenerate frequencies.

There is a similar description for the hypersurface  for strings
on all smooth homogeneous plane-waves. In this case  is a fibration
over the space of parameters with fibre which has generically  points.
The fibration degenerates precisely when two or more frequencies become the same.

Berry's Connection 

It is well known that during an adiabatic evolution along
a closed path in the space of parameters of a quantum mechanical
system, the wave functions  develop a phase
which  is the holonomy of the
Berry connection.  The quantum mechanical systems that
we are investigating in connection to string theory in smooth
homogeneous waves have such parameters. Adiabatic evolution
in the present context means that we allow the parameters,
like the rotation  and the matrix , to depend adiabatically on the
light-cone time . The resulting quantum mechanical set-up becomes
precisely that which appears in the context of  Berry's connection.
We shall not investigate here the general case. Instead, we
shall focus on the quantum mechanical models that arise for strings in four-dimensional
plane-waves, like those described in section 2.6. In addition, we  shall assume
the generic case where there is no degeneracy of states.  We shall find that
the curvature of the Berry connection vanishes.

Using the unitary transformation  uni , we can construct a basis in the Hilbert space of
the quantum mechanical  system described in section 2.6
as follows:
_n_1, n_2 >=U(_1, _2) n_1, n_2> ,
where
n_1, n_2>=1n_1! n_2!   (_1^+)^n_1  (_2^+)^n_2  0> 
is the standard basis in the Hilbert space of a two-dimensional Harmonic
oscillator with frequencies , masses  and creation (annihilation)
operators  ().  We follow the notation of
section 2.6. Under the assumptions we have
made, these states are not degenerate and depend on the parameters
 and . The Berry connection is
A ^n_1, n_2 = <_n_1, n_2  d _n_1, n_2 > ,
where the exterior derivative  is with respect to the parameters of the
system. Using bbst , we can write
bbb 
A ^n_1, n_2 = <n_1, n_2 U^+(_1, _2) d U(_1, _2) n_1, n_2>+
<n_1, n_2 d n_1, n_2> .
We shall show that the first term in the right-hand-side of bbb  vanishes.
Indeed, 


  


 
bbc 
= -i d_1
<n_1, n_2U^+(_1, _2) xy U(_1, _2)n_1, n_2> .
However, as it was shown in, after adjusting for notation, we have
U^+(_1, _2) x U(_1, _2)&=&x+_2 p_y
U^+(_1, _2) y U(_1, _2)&=&y+_2 p_x .
Thus we find
bbc &=&-i _2 d_1  <n_1, n_2(xp_x+p_y y) n_1, n_2>
&=&
12  _2 d_1 <n_1, n_2([_1, _1^+]- [_2, _2^+])n_1, n_2>=0 .
It remains to commute the second term in the right-hand-side of bbb . For this,
we first compute  using




and



to find
<0d0>= N^-1  dN-14   (m_1 _1)^-1  d (m_1 _1)-14 
 (m_2 _2)^-1  d (m_2 _2)=0 .
Next,  observe that




Using these relations and  also that 
,
we finally find  . Thus we conclude that
 and so the Berry connection vanishes.
This may be due to the fact that the light cone
Hamiltonian is associated with a Klein-Gordon equation which is
real.  The same applies also to 
the quantum mechanical system associated with the string 
at level  (for ).
