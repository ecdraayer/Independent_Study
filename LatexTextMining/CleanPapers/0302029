Abstract A localized configuration is found
in the 5D bulk-boundary theory
on an  orbifold of 
Mirabelli-Peskin.
A bulk scalar and the extra (fifth) component of
the bulk vector constitute the configuration. 
 SUSY is preserved.
The effective potential of the SUSY theory is obtained
using the background field method. 
The vacuum is generalized
in relation to the treatment of the extra coordinate.
Taking into account the supersymmetric boundary condition , 
the Coleman-Weinberg potential is correctly obtained.
The scalar-loop contribution to the Casimir potential
is concretely identified. It depends on the brane
configuration parameters besides the  periodicity
parameter.

1  Introduction Through the development of the 
recent several years, it looks that  
the higher-dimensional approach begins to obtain the citizenship 
as an important building tool in constructing a unified theory.
Among many ideas in this approach,  
the system of bulk and boundary  theories becomes a fascinating model
of the unification. 
The boundary is regarded as
our 4D world. It is inspired by the M, string and D-brane theories.
One pioneering paper, giving a concrete realization, 
 is that by Mirabelli and Peskin. 
They consider 
5D supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with a boundary matter.
The boundary couplings with the bulk world
are uniquely fixed by the SUSY requirement. 
They demonstrated some consistency of the bulk and boundary quantum effects
by calculating self-energy  of the scalar matter field.
Here we examine the vacuum configuration and
the effective potential.

Contrary to the motivation of ref., 
we do not seek a SUSY breaking mechanism, rather
we make use of the SUSY invariant properties
in order to make the problem as simple as possible.
The SUSY symmetry is so restrictive that we only
need to calculate some small portion of
all possible diagrams.

In the calculation of the effective potential
of the 5D model, we recall that of the Kaluza-Klein model. 
The dynamics quantumly produces the effective
potential which describes the Casimir effect.
The situation, however, is 
different from the present case
in the following points: 
1) the 4D reduction mechanism; 
2) Z-symmetry; 
3) treatment of the vacuum with respect to
 the extra-coordinate dependence; 
4) supersymmetry; 
5) characteristic length scales.
We will compare the present result with the KK case.








2  Mirabelli-Peskin Model Let us consider the 5 dimensional flat space-time with the signature
(1,-1,-1,-1,-1).
(
Notation is the same as ref..
)  
The space of the fifth
component is taken to be (), 
with the periodicity , and has the -orbifold condition.

 

We take a 
5D bulk theory  which is
coupled with a 4D matter theory  on a "wall" at 
and with  on the other "wall" at .
The boundary Lagragians are, in the bulk action,  described by
 the delta-functions along the extra axis .

 

We take

 

(Necessity of the minus sign will be stated later.)
We consider both bulk and boundary quantum effects.
For the boundaries, however, 
we may examine only the brane at  because 
the quantum effect
from the other brane is considered to be higher order.

The bulk dynamics is given by the 5D super YM theory
which is made of 
a vector field , 
a scalar field , 
a doublet of symplectic Majorana fields , 
and a triplet of auxiliary scalar fields :

 

where all bulk fields are the adjoint  representation
of the gauge group . 
The bulk Lagrangian  
is invariant under the 5D SUSY transformation.














This system has the symmetry of
8 real super charges.
As the 5D gauge-fixing term, we take the Feynman

gauge:

 

The corresponding ghost Lagrangian is given by

 

where  and  are the complex ghost fields. 
We take the following bulk action.

 


It is known that we can consistently project out  SUSY
multiplet, which has 4 real super charges, 







by assigning -parity 
to all fields in accordance with the 5D SUSY. 
A consistent choice is given as:   for 
;   for 
 (). 
Then () constitute
 an  vector multiplet. 
Especially  plays the role
of D-field  on the wall. 
We introduce a 4 dim chiral multiplet () on the wall: 
a complex scalar field ,  a Weyl spinor , and
an auxiliary field of complex scalar . 
This is the simplest matter candidate and was taken
in the original theory. 
Using the  SUSY property of the fields (),
we can find the following bulk-boundary coupling.

 

where 
.
We take the fundamental representation for . 
The quadratic (kinetic) terms of the vector , the gaugino spinor 
and the 'auxiliary' field  are in the bulk 
Lagrangian . 
We note the interaction between the bulk fields and the boundary
ones is definitely fixed from SUSY.




3  SUSY Boundary Condition, Background Expansion and Generalized vacuum First we point out an important fact about
the SUSY effective potential. 
The 1-loop SUSY effective potential can be calculated
only by the scalar loop Non-scalar
external fields are always put zero from the definition
of the effective potential.
 
up to the - and -independent terms 
in the off-shell treatment. 
If we trace the origin of this phenomenon, 
it is simply that
the auxiliary fields have the
higher physical dimension  of . They
cannot have the Yukawa coupling with fermions and vectors.
F and D-dependence in the SUSY effective
potential is very important to determine the vacuum behaviour. 
The above fact means that 
 ( or  )  
is definitely determined only by the scalar loop.
Miller, using the above fact, 
obtained  
F-tadpole or D-tadpole 
(F and D-tadpole correspond to 
and , respectively.) 
in general 4D SUSY theories. 
He noticed, if the theory preserve SUSY at the quantum level, 
the  and -independent  parts in  can be obtained
not by calculating diagrams but 
by a boundary condition  on the effective potential.
This is because, 
in the SUSY-preserving case, the effective potential
should satisfy: 
 -supersymmetric boundary condition -.
He confirmed the correctness by comparing his results with
the results in the ordinary method. (See ref.for an application to unified models.)  
We follow Miller's idea.

Hence we may put, 
for the purpose of obtaining the 1-loop SUSY effective potential, 
the following conditions: 

 

Here the extra (fifth) component of the bulk vector  
does not  taken to be zero because it is regarded
as a 4D scalar  on the wall. 



The extra coordinate  is regarded as a parameter.











Then     
reduces to

 

where we have dropped terms of 
as  'irrelevant terms' because they decouple from other fields. 
(Note 
.) While
 reduces to

 

where we have dropped -terms as the irrelevant terms.
 are the suffixes of the fundamental representation.

Now we take the background-field method 
to obtain the effective
potential. 
We expand all scalar fields (), except ghosts, 
into the quantum fields  (which are denoted again by the same symbols) 
and the background fields 
().

 

We treat the ghosts  and  as quantum fields. 



We state an important point of the background-fields
in the space with the extra dimension. 
Usually we take the following procedure in order 
to obtain the vacuum .

[Ordinary  procedure of the vacuum search]1) First we obtain the effective potential
assuming the scalar  property of the vacuum
(as described in ())
and the constancy  of the scalar vacuum
expectation values. 2) Then we take the minimum of the effective
potential.


In the present case, however, we have the extra  coordinate . 
We have "freedom" in the treatment of the vacuum expectation values
because  is regarded as a parameter. 
We require that
the background fields may be constant only in 4D world, not necessarily
in 5D world . 
We may allow the background fields to depend on the extra coordinate . 
This gives an interesting possibility to the higher dimensional model and 
generalizes the vacuum of the system. 

When the background fields () satisfy 
the field equations  derived from () and (),
we say they satisfy the "on-shell" condition. The equations are given as, 

 

where we assume, based on the standpoint of the previous paragraph,

. 
In the above derivation, we use the fact that 
total divergences, in the action, 
vanish from the periodicity  condition. 
Because we seek the effective potential (an off-shell quantity), 
we generally do not need to assume the above on-shell condition. 
However the minimum  of the effective potential should always
be consistent with the on-shell condition. 
The on-shell condition will become important 
when we restrict  the forms of the background fields.
(See later discussion.)
A new on-shell condition will be replaced. 
We should check that the new minimum  
is consistent with the new on-shell condition.

The quadratic  part w.r.t. the quantum fields ()
give us
the 1-loop quantum effect. This part 
is given as

 



















where  
 is the background (4 dimensional) D-field and 
.
Now we can integrate out the auxiliary field  in
.  We obtain
the final "1-loop Lagrangian", necessary for the present purpose, as

 



























4  Mass-Matrix and the Localized Background Configuration We are now ready for the full ( with repect to the coupling order) 
calculation of the 1-loop effective potential. 
The "1-loop action" can be expressed as

 

where  is decoupled from others, and the components s
are read from (). 




































Now we restrict the form of the background fields 
in the present 5D approach. The relevant scalars
are  and  in the bulk. 






We should
take into account the -dependence 
and the Z-property of the background fields.

(i) brane-anti-brane solutionWe take the following forms of  and ,
which describe the localized (around ) configurations and
a natural generalization of the ordinary treatment stated before.


 

where  is the periodic sign function 
with the periodicity .  and  are 
some positive constants. See Fig.1.

Background fields  and  behave as

.

 


It is the thin-wall limit  of a (periodic) kink solution
and shows the localization  of the fields. 

The background fields, (),
satisfy the required boundary condition. 
We show they also satisfy the on-shell condition  () 
for an appropriate
choice of  and .
The assumed background forms are summarized as 

 

where "const"'s mean some constants which generally may be different. 




We note the relation

 

which expresses the localization  of the bulk scalar
at  and . It is considered to be the field theoretical
version of the brane-anti-brane configuration. 
See Fig.2. 

 
 figure=DelFunc.eps,height=3cm,angle=0  



 Behaviour of 
 .

 


Using this relation, 
the four equations in () can be replaced by

 

We note here the following things.
 
When , the following relations hold: 
.

.
.
Then we can conclude that () is a solution of the field
equation ()  for the following choice.

 

(
The another choice is given by : 





.
) 
In this choice  is concluded. 
We can regard these as the new on-shell condition due to the
restriction of the background fields (). 
We note that the sign choice
in () comes from the consistency with the above solution.
(
Instead, we can start from a more general case where () is not
postulated but 
 is made of another chiral multiplet .
Then the brane-anti-brane solution () with 
 is derived
from the on-shell condition.



) 

The present vacuum (minimum point of the effective potential)
should be consistent with (). 

(ii) Sawtooth wave solution

We consider another solution. 

 

where  is the sawtooth wave  (periodic linear function)
with the periodicity .  and  are 
some positive constants. See Fig.3.

 
 figure=SawTooth.eps,height=3cm,angle=0  



 
The graph of the sawtooth wave , ().
Background fields  and  behave as

.

 


Using (), with the following relations in : 

, 
the four equations of the on-shell condition ()
can be rewritten as

 

All equations are satisfied by the choice:

 

In this choice, . 
From the form of  (see Fig.4), 
these backgrounds are considered to describe a non-localized
configuration.


 
 figure=Const.eps,height=3cm,angle=0  



 Behaviour of 
  for the sawtooth wave solution ().

 



Let us evaluate , (), furthermore taking the 
localized solution (i).
(
The solution (ii) will be treated in the forthcoming paper.
) 
 From the periodicity () and the Z 
property, the bulk quantum fields  and 
can be KK-expanded as

 

(The -parity of the ghost field is even because it should be
the same as that of 
the gauge parameter  : . )


Now we use 
the Fourier expansion of the periodic sign function,

 

and the relation: 

 

Noting the above equations and (), 
we can express  in terms of the 4D integral as follows.

 

where the integer suffixes  and  runs from 1 to , and 
each component is described as

 

where the kinetic (free) part is also included 
() 
in the "Mass" matrix and the repeated indices imply the Einstein's 
summation convention. 
 is decoupled and is given by

 

This contribution is treated independently from others.




5  Effective Potential of Bulk-Boundary System The effective potential
is obtained from the eigen values of the mass-matrix obtained
in (),() and (). We briefly
see the behaviour for two typical cases.

(A)(Bulk-Boundary decoupled case)In this case the matrix  decouples to the boundary part 
() 
and the bulk part (). The former part gives the following eigen values.

 

where we take G=SU(2) and the doublet representation for the boundary matter
fields.  and  is the 4D momentum. 
This gives, taking the supersymmetric boundary condition,
the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) potential:

 

The last approximated form 
is logarithmically divergent and can be checked by the perturbative (w.r.t. ) calculation. 
It is renormalized
by the bulk  wave function of  and .  Here the 4D world's 
connection to the Bulk world appears. The quantum fluctuation
within the boundary influence the bulk world through the renormalization.
The appearance of the CW potential is natural from the fact that the ordinary
SUSY theories quantumly produce the potential and the present model
is a 5D generalization of the ordinary ones.

The bulk part of  and the ghost part does not  depend on .
They depend only on  and  (and the length unit ).
It means that this part does not  contribute to the effective potential
in the supersymmetric boundary condition. We can interpret that this part
is the scalar-loop contribution to the Casimir potential which depends
on  and  (and the length unit ). It is, however, cancelled
by the spinor and vector-loop contribution in the present SUSY theory.
Therefore we expect the brane-anti-brane solution (i) does not collapse. 

(B)In this case, the localized configuration disappears.
The bulk background configuration is trivial. 5D bulk quantum fields
fluctuate 
with the periodic boundary condition in the extra space. 
This is similar to the 5D Kaluza-Klein case mentioned
in the introduction. The eigen values for the bulk part,
 and  are commonly given by, 

 

The eigen value structure is basically the same as the KK case.
They depend only  on the radius (or the periodicity) parameter .
This part, taking the supersymmetric boundary condition,
does not  contribute to the effective potential. It can be regarded
as the scalar-loop contribution to the Casimir potential.
From the dimensional analysis it should have the form
.



The eigenvalues for the boundary part is obtained as 
a complicated expression involving the following terms:

 

For some special cases only, we present here the explicit forms.(i) This is a special case of (A), the decoupled case.

 

It is consistent with Case (A).

(ii) , others= ()
 

This is consistent with the perturbative result
(the vertex correction on the boundary)
 up to the order of . 

 



6  Conclusion We have analyzed the effective potential of 
the Mirabelli-Peskin model. An interesting
localized configuration (solution) is found 
in the bulk scalar
and the extra-component of the bulk vector
when we solve the field equation (on-shell condition).
The vacuum is generalized in connection to
the treatment of the extra-axis. 
We treat  as a parameter independent of the 4D world. 
In this SUSY invariant theory, the Casimir
force vanishes. Its scalar-loop contribution
can be evaluated from the obtained explicit matrix
elements depending on the boundary parameters
,  and . 

We hope the present result improves 
the understanding of the quantum dynamics of 
the bulk-boundary system.
