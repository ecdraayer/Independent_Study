Abstract 
We present new supersymmetric domain wall and string solutions
of five-dimensional  gauged supergravity coupled to an
arbitrary number of vector multiplets. Using the techniques of very
special geometry allows to obtain the most general domain wall
preserving half of the supersymmetries. This solution, which describes a
renormalization group flow in the dual field theory, is given in terms of
Weierstrass elliptic functions. The magnetically charged, one quarter
supersymmetric string solutions are shown to be closely related to Liouville
theory. We furthermore investigate general product space compactifications,
and show that topological transitions from AdS  S to
AdS  H can occur when one moves in moduli space.
 


Introduction 



The conjectured equivalence between string theory on anti-de Sitter (AdS)
spaces (times some compact manifold) and certain superconformal gauge
theories living on the boundary of AdS has led to an increasing
interest in solutions of gauged supergravities that preserve some fraction
of supersymmetry. On the CFT side, these supergravity vacua could correspond
to an expansion around non-zero vacuum expectation values of certain operators,
or describe a holographic renormalization group flow. In that
way, one can study strongly coupled field theories using classical supergravity
solutions. Of particular interest in this context are solutions that describe
black holes, domain
walls or strings.

In our paper we will concentrate on five-dimensional  gauged supergravity
coupled to vector multiplets, which is relevant for holographic descriptions of
field theories in four dimensions with less than maximal supersymmetry. In particular, we
give a systematic treatment of supersymmetric domain walls and strings.
Using the tools of very special geometry, which underlies the considered supergravity
theory, allows to obtain the most general domain wall
preserving half of the supersymmetries. This solution, which describes a holographic
renormalization group flow, turns out to be given in terms of the Weierstrass elliptic
function. We show that the RG flow is a so-called vev flow, and derive the holographic
beta and -functions. The geometry has a curvature singularity signaling
nontrivial IR physics. Applying the existing criteria for allowed singularities we
obtain conditions that the invariants of the elliptic function must satisfy.

Magnetically charged string-like solutions of gauged supergravities in five dimensions
have been derived first in. Init was suggested that solutions interpolating between AdS and AdS  H
have a holographic interpretation as a four-dimensional CFT that is given a
relevant perturbation and flows to a two-dimensional CFT in the IR. This aspect was
then elaborated by Maldacena and Nunez.
In the present work, magnetically charged strings preserving one quarter of the
supersymmetries will be studied in more detail. In particular, we show that for the
case of constant scalar fields the solutions are given in terms of functions that
satisfy the Liouville equation. They can thus be classified according to their
monodromy, which can be elliptic, hyperbolic or parabolic. The monodromy is determined
by the Liouville momentum, which turns out to be related to the curvature of the
two-dimensional Riemann surfaces into which the space transverse to the strings is
sliced.

We furthermore investigate general product space compactifications of the
five-dimensional theory. These geometries preserve half of the supersymmetries and
are of the form AdS  S or AdS  H. It will be shown that
topological transitions from the former to the latter case can appear when one
moves in moduli space. In certain cases the product geometries can arise as
near-horizon limit of the one quarter supersymmetric strings mentioned above.
One has then supersymmetry enhancement near the horizon.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In order to make the
paper self-contained, we briefly review ,  gauged supergravity coupled
to vector multiplets in section . In section  we write down
a general ansatz for supersymmetric solutions that includes both string-like
and domain wall configurations. The Killing spinor equations are analyzed and
a flow equation for the scalar fields is obtained. In section  we
derive the most general half supersymmetric domain wall solution and discuss its
holographic interpretation. In the following section, the fixed points of the flow
equation are studied, and it is shown that they lead either to magnetically charged strings
with constant scalars or to product space geometries. We discuss the connection of
the magnetic strings with Liouville theory, and show the possibility of topological
transitions for the product space "compactifications". In section a new magnetic string solution with varying scalars is presented, and its
holographic interpretation is briefly discussed. Electrically charged solutions
are considered in section .
We conclude with some final remarks in section .



,  Gauged Supergravity 


We start with a brief description of five-dimensional 
-gauged supergravity theories. The fields of these theories consist of a
graviton , gravitino ,  vector potentials
 (),  gauginos  and 
scalars  (). The bosonic part of the
Lagrangian is given by
 

where  are spacetime indices,  is the scalar curvature,
 denote the abelian field-strength tensors of the
vectors , and  is the determinant of the
funfbein . The scalar potential  is given by

 

where  are constants,  denotes a partial derivative
with respect to the scalar field  and 
are real scalars satisfying the condition 
. Moreover,  and  can be
expressed in terms of the homogeneous cubic polynomial  which
defines a "very special geometry",

* 

Further useful relations can be found in appendix . We note
that if the five-dimensional theory is obtained by gauging a supergravity
theory coming from a Calabi-Yau compactification of M-theory, then 
is the intersection form,  and 
correspond to the size of the two- and four-cycles and  are the
intersection numbers of the Calabi-Yau threefold.

The supersymmetry transformations of the gravitino  and the
gauginos  in a bosonic background read
 

where  is the supersymmetry parameter and  is
the fully gauge and gravitationally covariant derivative 

 

Here,  denotes the spin connection and  are
Dirac matrices(We use the metric , 
, and 
.) .




Supersymmetric String Solutions 


As a general ansatz for supersymmetric string-like solutions we consider
metrics of the form

 

where  and  are functions of the radial coordinate  only(We apologize
for using the same symbol  for the scalar potential and
for the function appearing in the metric (), but the meaning should be
clear from the context.) , and
 denotes the standard metric on a two-dimensional surface 
of constant scalar curvature , where . An explicit form is

 

with

 

Clearly  is a quotient space of the universal coverings  (),
S () or H ().

With the choice (), the funfbein reads

 

and the nonvanishing components of the spin connection are given by

 

where a prime denotes a derivative.

In five dimensions, strings can carry magnetic charges under the one-form
potentials , so we assume that the gauge fields have only a magnetic part,
i. e.

 

Note that  is essentially the Kahler form on .

Plugging the spin connection () and the magnetic fields ()
into the supersymmetry transformations of the gravitino (), we obtain for the
Killing spinors  the equations

 

where  denotes the magnetic central charge.

We choose as partial supersymmetry breaking conditions

 

This preserves one quarter of the original supersymmetries, i. e. , it reduces the
number of real supercharges from eight to two.

The integrability conditions following from Eqns. () yield

 

as well as the charge quantization condition

 

Notice that (), together with ,
implies the twisting
 

where  is the spin connection on .

Using () and (), the radial equation can be easily solved,
to give

 

where  denotes a constant spinor subject to the constraints
(). When the Eqns. (), (), () and
() hold, the Killing spinor equations () are all
satisfied. What remains are the supersymmetry transformations of the gauginos
(), which yield

 

and thus, keeping in mind that ,

 

where  is some function of  that can be determined by contracting
() with . In this way one obtains

 

Using (), () and () in (), we finally get
the "flow equation" for the scalars,

 



The Case : Domain Walls 


Let us first consider the case of a flat manifold , i. e. ,
which will turn out to be completely integrable, with solutions given in
terms of Weierstrass elliptic functions. Below we will see that the metric
assumes then the form of a domain wall.
For  we obtain from Eqn. ()

 

and hence from ()

 

Using () in the flow equation (), we get for the scalars


 

which is easily solved to give

 

where the  denote integration constants. In what follows it will be useful to
introduce the quantities

 

with  defined in ().
Let us furthermore define the function

 

where the new radial coordinate  is given by .
Plugging () into Eqn. (), we obtain then the
differential equation

 

where a dot denotes a derivative with respect to  and

 

The general solution of Eqn. () is given by

 

where  denotes the Weierstrass elliptic function, and  is an
integration constant, which we will put equal to zero without loss of generality.
 and  are the invariants that are related
to the periods  and  of the Weierstrass elliptic function by
the Eisenstein series

 

where .

Our supergravity solution is thus given by

 

 

with  defined by

 

Note that also Eqn. (), which has not been used above, is satisfied by
this solution.
From () we see that the metric is conformally flat like the one
of AdS, but in contrast to the latter, our solution preserves only part
of the supersymmetries, and nonconstant scalar fields are turned on.

Using the expansion

 

for , one sees that asymptotically the solution ()
approaches AdS in Poincare  coordinates, and should thus have a
dual CFT interpretation. In order to investigate this
point further, we expand also the scalars,

 

where . Let us focus for a moment on the
STU model (which will be discussed in more detail in section ).
This model can be obtained by compactification of ten-dimensional type IIB
supergravity, and has two independent scalars with mass squared
. They are thus dual to operators of dimension
.
For this dimension, the scalars  behave as  or 
for . The first kind of behaviour corresponds to the
non-normalizable mode associated to the insertion of an operator.
From () we see that in our case the operators dual to the bulk scalars
are not inserted. Instead, we have a so-called vev flow(See e. g. .) ,
corresponding to a change of vacuum in the dual field theory, in which the operator
is given a vev.

Let us now come back to the case of an arbitrary number of vector multiplets, and
note that one can cast the solution () into the domain wall form

 

where the new radial coordinate  is defined by ,
, and  denotes the flat Minkowski metric in
four dimensions. (), together with the scalars (),
represent the most general domain wall solution to ,  gauged supergravity
coupled to vector multiplets. From () we can compute the holographic
-function of the renormalization group flow, given by
 

which yields in our case

 

Furthermore, if we use () as well as , we can rewrite
the flow equation () in the form

 

where

 

As the scalars  represent coupling constants for the dual operators,
and the function  determines the physical scale of the dual field
theory, we recognize () as the Callan-Symanzik equation, with the
-th beta function given by ().

Notice that for , supersymmetry is actually enhanced from one quarter to
one half, because the constraint  in
() can be dropped in this case. The Killing spinors for the domain
wall solution (), () read

 

where the constant spinor is subject to the constraint .

In general, the solution () has a curvature singularity for
, e. g. the scalar curvature reads

 

In our case, the invariants ,  are real, so that  is real
for , and one has a real and an imaginary period (although these
are not primitive periods for ). This means that
if we start from  (AdS region) and go to positive values of  (following
the RG trajectory), we will eventually reach a point  where 
vanishes. The appearance of this curvature singularity is a signal of nontrivial IR
physics. According to Gubser's criterion, large curvatures in
geometries of the form () are allowed only if the scalar potential is
bounded above in the solution(It is straightforward to show that the coordinate
 used in () assumes a finite value for , so Gubser's
criterion applies.) . Let us see what this restriction implies here.
To this end, we start from the potential in the form (),
and use the expression () for the scalars. This yields

 

As  is always positive, and goes to  for
, we must have  in order that the potential
be bounded above in the solution. It is straightforward to show that this
implies

 

Apart from that, there is another physically admissible solution for .
In this degenerate case one has , so the metric reduces to that of
AdS.

It would be interesting to lift a solution with a "bad" singularity to ten
dimensions. This is feasible e. g. for the STU model. Probably this leads to
pathologies of D3-branes with negative tension and negative charges.
We will not attempt to do this here.


A special case appears if the integration constants  in ()
vanish. One has then from () after some simple algebra

 

In other words, the Schwarzian derivative 
vanishes. Using  following from (),
the differential equation () yields

 

 denoting an integration constant. () is actually a first
integral of the Liouville equation with zero "momentum". To see this, consider
the Liouville equation

 

where  is a constant, in spherical coordinates ,
for Liouville fields  independent of the angular coordinate .
In this case one has from ()

 

The action from which () follows is invariant under the transformation
, , with . The
first integral associated to this invariance is

 

where the integration constant  is essentially the Liouville
momentum. Comparing with (),
we see that  has zero momentum, and corresponds thus to a parabolic
Liouville solution, given by

 

One can now use () in () to determine the scalar fields,
with the result

 

and thus the scalars are forced to be constants in the case , .

Determining finally  from () yields the metric

 

Introducing the coordinate , one easily sees that ()
is AdS in Poincare  coordinates, and thus preserves all supersymmetries.



Fixed Points of the Flow Equation 


We now come back to the case of general , and would like to
determine the fixed points of the flow equation (), i. e. , the
points where , and thus

 

From () and () we get

 

Inserting this into () yields

 

Obviously we have to distinguish two cases, namely  constant and  not
constant. Let us first study the latter case. From the foregoing equation we have
then

 

The values  for the scalars are exactly the ones which extremize the
magnetic central charge (This is analogous to the extremal electric central
charge for black holes in the ungauged theory.) .
The critical value of  reads

 

Using  in the charge quantization condition (),
one obtains

 

We will now show that similar to the case , the Liouville equation appears
also for . To see this, define the field  by

 

Making use of (), () and (), it is straightforward to
show that

 

which is again a first integral of the Liouville equation, with momentum
given by , as can be seen by comparing with ().
The field  satisfies thus the Liouville equation

 

For , we have real momentum, so the solution is hyperbolic,

 

whereas for  (imaginary momentum), the solution is elliptic,

 

Determining also  from (), one obtains finally for the metric

 

with the Liouville momentum . () coincides with the
solutions found in, which are written here
in different coordinates that make the connection with Liouville theory more
evident(It is worth pointing out that also the magnetic branes of
Einstein-Maxwell-AdS gravity in arbitrary dimension considered
in can be written in terms of functions satisfying
the Liouville equation.) .
We observe that the line element () is invariant under the transformations
 or , where . In terms of the coordinate
 this means  or . Note that  is real
only for . In this case, one encounters a naked curvature singularity for
. For , the singularity is hidden by a horizon, which appears
for . The solution approaches AdS  H near the horizon.
It will be shown below that this geometry has enhanced supersymmetry.
Notice finally that the conformal boundary of the solution () is
reached for .


We come now to the case where  is constant. From ()
one sees that this corresponds to a product space ,
with  a three-manifold to be determined below. Let us decompose
 and  in a part parallel to  and a part orthogonal to ,

 

where  is a projector satisfying
, and ,  parametrize the parts
orthogonal to . Plugging the above decompositions into ()
and eliminating  by means of () yields

 

where we defined ,  and .
Using Eqns. (), () and () in (),
one gets

 

From () we conclude that  for , and 
for . For  an interesting topological
transition occurs(In only the case  was
considered. This leads to .) .
Start e. g. with positive , so that
, i. e.  is a two-sphere. Let then  go
to zero, which means that the radius  goes to zero, so that the S shrinks
to a point. When  changes sign to become negative, the
two-manifold  restarts to blow up, but now as a hyperbolic space H.
These topological transitions are similar to the ones considered
in(Note however that in
 cycles in the internal Calabi-Yau manifold
shrink to zero and then blow up into a different Calabi-Yau, whereas in our case
the moduli  do not go to zero at the transition.) .
Let us examine in more detail the transition point. Using () and
(), one easily shows that  is equivalent to

 

It would be interesting to understand the meaning of this topological transition
in the dual conformal field theory.

We still have to determine the function . Integrating Eqn. ()
one obtains

 

If we finally introduce the new coordinate  defined by
, the five-dimensional metric reads

 

so that the manifold is AdS . 

It turns out that in the case of constant , the constraint
 on the Killing spinors can be dropped,
so that we only impose . The above
product space solutions preserve thus half of the supersymmetry.
The Killing spinors read

 

where we defined the projectors , ,
and  denotes an arbitrary constant spinor.



Nonconstant Scalars and  


We now consider the flow equation () for the case of
nonconstant scalar fields and . To be specific, we consider the STU model
which has only one intersection number  nonzero. This model
can be embedded into gauged  and  supergravity as well.
Furthermore, it can be obtained by compactification of ten-dimensional type
IIB supergravity. This allows to lift the solutions
presented below to ten dimensions.

The prepotential reads

 

Taking ,  and  one gets for the matrix 

 

Without loss of generality we assume .
Considering  as the dependent field (i. e. ) we find for the
potential

 

which has a minimum .

The equations to solve are given in appendix .
Maldacena and Nunez found solutions to these equations with
nonconstant scalars for the special case  and ,
where the operator dual to  is inserted. We will present here a different solution,
where the operators dual to the bulk scalars are not inserted, but instead
they are given a vev by a change of vacuum in the dual field theory.

In appendix  it is shown that for the STU model, a special solution
to the Eqns. (), (), () and () is
given by

 

where again . The conformal boundary is approached for .
As in () we can expand the moduli for , and see that
they behave as the normalizable mode, so that the dual operators are not inserted.
Note that if , the above metric becomes singular for . In order to
decide whether this singularity is allowed or not, one cannot use the criterion
of, because strictly speaking this applies only to geometries
of the domain wall form. We can however lift our solution to ten dimensions using
the rules given in, and then use the criterion ofwhich states that the component  of the ten-dimensional metric should not
increase as we approach the singularity. In our case it is easy to show that
 blows up like , so that the singularity would not be
allowed according to.






Electric Solutions 


One can try to find an electric analogue of (). An
obvious ansatz would be

 

where again  and  are functions of  only, and 
denotes the standard metric on two-dimensional Minkowski space (),
de Sitter space dS () or anti-de Sitter space AdS ().
A possible choice is

 

with

 

For the gauge fields we take

 

Using projection conditions on the Killing spinors analogous to
(), one finds that the charge quantization condition
is now given by

 

so that either the charges  or the coupling constant  have to be
imaginary, which is of course unphysical.
Nevertheless the possibility of having imaginary coupling constant 
suggests that supersymmetric electric solutions of the type considered here
might exist in the exotic de Sitter supergravity theories introduced by
Hull.





Final Remarks 


We conclude this paper by pointing out some possible extensions of the
work presented here. First of all, one notes that for the magnetic strings,
the solutions with parabolic, hyperbolic or elliptic
monodromy (cf. Eqns. (), () and ())
essentially coincide with the Weierstrass elliptic
function  (with ) for the degenerate case where the discriminant
 vanishes (see e. g. ). This suggests
that there might exist more general magnetically charged string solutions, whose
metric is given in terms of elliptic functions. If these solutions preserve some
supersymmetry, it is clear from the results of our paper that nonconstant scalars
have to be turned on in this case.

Furthermore, it would be interesting to find the nonextremal or rotating
generalizations(In four dimensions, the rotating generalization of the
magnetically charged, one quarter supersymmetric soliton was found
in.)  of the supersymmetric strings found here.
Holographically, this would correspond to considering respectively field theories
at finite temperature or on a rotating manifold.

We hope to report on these points in a future publication.

Solutions with nonconstant Scalars for  


For the STU model considered in section , we
introduce the rescaled fields  so that .
The equations (), (), () and () become

& & g _I q^I = 1, 

& & g _I x^I = -( 2V +W +1 ),  

& & k _I q^I x^I  = -2 ( W +1-V ) , 

& & -kq^I -x^I +2gx^I2  +(2V +W +1 )x^I = 0, where the dot denotes a derivative with respect to .
Using () in () we find

& & kq^1 +x^1 + g(-x^1 + x^2 + x^3) x^1 = 0, 

& & kq^2 +x^2 + g(x^1 - x^2 + x^3) x^2 = 0,  

& & kq^3 +x^3 + g(x^1 + x^2 - x^3) x^3 = 0. Note that from  we derive

3(W + 1) = _I x ^I x^I ,


which confronted with the sum of () and () gives the 
consistency condition

_I x ^I x^I  = -g _I x^I - k _I q^I x^I ,
which is satisfied by the system ().

One can then solve the Eqns. () and use
 to find  and finally () or ()
to determine  so that

ds^2 = (_I x^I)^-13  e^-g _J x^J du 
(-dt^2 +dz^2) +(_I x^I)^23  (du^2 + d_k^2 ).
If we introduce the functions

& & y^1 = x^1 + x^2 - x^3, 

& & y^2 = x^1 - x^2 - x^3, 

& & y^3 = x^1 - x^2 + x^3, and the constants

& & Q^1 = -k(q^1 +q^2 -q^3 ), 

& & Q^2 = -k(q^1 -q^2 -q^3 ), 

& & Q^3 = -k(q^1 -q^2 +q^3 ), the system () becomes

& & Q^1 - y^1 + g y^2 y^3 = 0,  

& & Q^2 - y^2 + g y^1 y^3 = 0,  

& & Q^3 - y^3 + g y^1 y^2 = 0. From () and () one finds

& & y^1 + y^2 = e^g y^3 du  [(Q^1 + Q^2) e^- gy^3 du  du + K_+
], 

& & y^1 - y^2 = e^-g y^3 du  [(Q^1 - Q^2) e^gy^3 du  du + K_- ],
          where  denote integration constants.
Using these expressions in () one obtains an integro-differential equation for
 which is quite complicated. However a solution can be found e. g. in the simple
case  and . This corresponds to

 

If we introduce the function

 

we obtain

 

Eqn. () becomes

^2_u h = g Q^3 - (g Q^1 h h )^2.
                              A special solution can be found using the ansatz

h(u) = h_0 e^u^2 ,
which solves () if





Choosing the plus(The minus sign leads to a solution where some of
the moduli  become negative. We discard this unphysical case.)  we get
the solution ().
