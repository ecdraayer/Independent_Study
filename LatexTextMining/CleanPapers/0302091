Introduction 
The pioneering investigations of mathematical topics
related to the the black hole equilibrium states
were attributed to Israel,
Muller zum Hagen et al.  and Robinson.
Bunting and Masood-ul-Alam proposed 
the alternative proof of the uniqueness of black hole solutions.
Then, the method was strengthened to the Einstein-Maxwell (EM) black holes
. Heusler comprised the 
magnetically charged Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) 
solution and static Einstein--model case
.
The classification of static of 
vacuum black holes was finished in, where
the condition of non-degeneracy of the 
event horizon was removed and it was shown that Schwarzschild black hole exhausted
the family of all appropriately regular black hole spacetimes.
In Ref. it was
revealed 
that RN solution comprised the family of regular
black hole spacetimes under the restrictive condition that all
degenerate components of black hole horizon carried a charge of the same sign.
The problem of stationary
and axisymmetric black hole spacetimes being the solution of vacuum 
Einstein equations was considered in Refs.,
while 
the systematic way of obtaining the desire results in
electromagnetic case was provided by Mazur 
 and Bunting.
For a review of the uniqueness of black hole
solutions story see and references therein. 
In the recent years there was a considerable resurgence of mathematical 
works concerning black hole equilibrium state in the low-energy string
theory. The uniqueness of the black hole solutions in dilaton gravity was  proved in 
works
, while the uniqueness of the static
dilaton 
black holes being the solution of  supergravity
was provided in. The extension of the proof to the theory
to allow for the inclusion of 
 static dilaton black holes was established in Ref..
The latest development of string theory 
as well as the possibility that the weak scale is the fundamental
scale of nature and the Planck scale is to be derived from ittrigger the interests in higher
dimensional black hole solutions. 
The so-called
TeV gravity attracts attention to higher dimensional black hole 
which may be produced in high energy experiments. It was revealed 
that
the five-dimensional stationary vacuum black hole are not unique. Myers-Perry
 solution generalized the Kerr solution to arbitrary dimension, while Emparan
et al.  revealed a counterexample showing that a five-dimensional
rotating black hole ring solution with the same angular momentum and mass
but the horizon of which was homeomorphic to .
The uniqueness theorem for -dimensional
Schwarzschild-Tangherlini
black hole was provided by
Gibbons et al.  and
for asymptotically flat
static -dimensional
charged (dilaton) black holes was presented in Ref..
The uniqueness theorem for self-gravitating nonlinear -models
in higher dimensional spacetime was obtained in.
As far as the stationary -dimensional black hole uniqueness theorem is concerned,
the proof for  supersymmetric black holes was given in
.
In this issue our strategy will be to modify the considerations
of Ruback and Chrusciel in order to comprise
the problem of the uniqueness of the charged -dimensional static 
black hole solutions containing an asymptotically flat spacelike 
hypersurface with compact interior and with both degenerate and
non-degenerate components of the event horizons.
In the attitude proposed by 
Ruback the metric induced on the hypersurface
orthogonal to the asymptotically timelike Killing vector field was considered.
In our case we shall
consider the orbit space  metric (defined below)
on the spacelike hypersurface .
The key considerations will be held near both degenerate and non-degenerate 
components of . 
Our key result will be the proof that a static higher dimensional charged black hole
spacetime containing an asymptotically flat spacelike hypersurface with
compact interior and with both degenerate and non-degenerate components of the 
event horizon exists, subject to the additional assumption that all
degenerate components of the horizon should have charges of the same signs.




Higher dimensional Einstein-Maxwell system 
We shall consider the -dimensional Einstein-Maxwell system described by the following
action:
I = d^n x -g   [  ^(n) R - 
F_ F^ 
],
where  is -dimensional metric tensor,
 is the Maxwell field.
The metric of -dimensional static spacetime with
asymptotically timelike Killing vector field 

and  has the following form:
ds^2 = - ^2 dt^2 + h_i j dx^i dx^j ,
where  and 
are independent of the -coordinate as the quantities
of the hypersurface  of constant . 
The hypersurface  is a connected and simply connected spacelike
hypersurface,  denotes the closure of it. The topological
boundary of ,   is a nonempty
topological manifold with  on . For the static
metric the electromagnetic potential will be of the form .
We treat first the problem of the orbit space . Namely,
as in Ref. we shall consider a point  of the manifold such that
 and perform a decomposition
T_p M = K (k_ ) K ^ ,
where  is the vector space spanned by the Killing
vector field  and  is the space orthogonal to the
vector space spanned by . We define the orbit space 
metric  in the form
g(X, Z) = h(X_ , Z_ ).
The metric  should not be identified with the metric on the space of orbits 
because one is not assuming any regularity properties of that space (in particular
we do not even assume that the space of orbits  is a differentiable manifold). One has
then
Y_  = Y - h(X, Y) h(X, X) X,
so we arrive at the following expression for the metric tensor 
g(Y, Z) = h(Y, Z) - h(X, Y) h(X, Z) h(X, X) .
As was proved in Ref. (lemma 5.1) if one had to do with the static spacetime 
and if we supposed
that  satisfied the same coordinate independent system
of equations, then the orbit space  metric  with the function  (where
 was the square of the norm of  on ) satisfied the same 
system of equations. This theorem enables us to write the equations of motion in the 
following form:
 ^(g) _i   ^(g) ^i  V &=& 
C^2 V   ^(g) _i  ^(g) ^i  , 
 
 ^(g) _i   ^(g) ^i  &=&  1 V  
 ^(g) _i   ^(g) ^i  V, 
 
 ^(n - 1) R_ij (g) - 1 V  ^(g) _i   ^(g) _j  V &=&
- 2 V^2   ^(g) _i  ^(g) _j  + 2  ^(g) _i   ^(g) ^i  (n - 2) V^2  g_ij ,
where we have denoted by , while  is the
electrostatic potential. The covariant derivative 
with respect to 
 is denoted by ,
while  is the Ricci tensor defined on 
the hypersurface .


Let us assume further
that we take into account the asymptotically flat spacetime,
i.e, the spacetime  
contains a data set
 with gauge fields such that 
 is diffeomorphic to  minus a ball and the 
following asymptotic conditions are fulfilled:
g_ij   - _ij  + r _a g_ij  + ... + r^k _a_1 ...a_k  g_ij  +
r K_ij  + ... + r^k _a_1 ...a_k  K_ij  O ( 1r  ), 

F_  + r _a  F_  + ... + r^k _a_1 ...a_k  F_  O ( 1 r^2  ).
Consequently, under the above assumptions,
there is
a standard coordinates
system in which we have the usual asymptotic expansion
V = 1 - r^n - 3   + O ( 1 r^n - 2   ),
and accordingly  for the metric tensor
g_ij  = ( 1 + 2 (n - 3) r^n - 3   ) _ij  +
O  ( 1 r^n - 2   ),
and for the electrostatic potential
= Q/C r^n - 3   + O  ( 1 r^n - 2   ),
where  is the ADM mass seen by the observer from the infinity, 
 is the electric charge while
.
Our next step will be the analysis
of the behaviour of  and  near .
By the theorems derived by Vishweshwara and Carterone obtains that  has to be a subset of a Killing horizon.
On the other hand, the Killing horizon is a smooth manifold.
As it is well known  is constant on any connected components
of the Killing horizon and it implies its constancy on .
In what follows, we shall call
a connected  component of 
degenerate and non-degenerate
when  intersects
a degenerate or non-degenerate Killing horizon, respectively. 
If necessary we can deform slightly the hypersurface 
in spacetime and we ensure that  is a smooth submanifold both
of  and of  near degenerate horizons.
As far as the non-degenerate horizon is concerned,
 will not be a smooth submanifold of . It is caused by the
existence of points on  at which the Killing vector field
 vanishes. As was proved in Ref. one could equip
 with a differentiable structure so that 
was a smooth submanifold of . The boundary 
with the differentiable structure is a totally geodesic
boundary of  across which  and the 
electric potential  can be smoothly extented across  when
a doubling of  across  is done.


Based on the observation presented by Ruback let us consider now the function
F_  = V^2 - ( 1 C)^2.
Having in mind equation of motion, by the direct calculations one can show that
 is harmonic in the metric .
 tend to zero as one approaches the asymptotically flat regions.
On the other hand,
on every components of  one obtains .
First, let us suppose that 
 on all components of . Next by means 
of the maximum principle one has that  on .
In the case for which  and  are negative
somewhere on , from maximum
principle we get that , provided that
V^2 < ( 1 - C)^2 , V^2 < ( 1 + C)^2,

on . By hypothesis  has no zeros on 
and having in mind () it shows
that  and  have no zeros there.
Both  and  tends to  at infinity which in turn implies that
 on . The above equations implies that
 on 
and we reach to the conclusion that
0 V + C 1.
The inequalities are strict except when the metric is locally Majumdar-Papapetrou
(MP).
The right inequality is strict on non-degenerate horizons.
If  we have that 
 and 
follows from the harmonicity of  in the metric  and the 
asymptotic strong maximum principle. Then, using the above arguments 
(as in proving Eq.()) one reaches to the conclusion that the metric is locally
MP.
The case  follows by providing the similar arguments as in the case
of .
Now we shall consider the case for which . 
In this stage of the proof we shall produce a data set to which one can apply 
considerations proposed by Rubback and Chrusciel.
Namely,
we take into account two 
copies of the hypersurface  and  and define metric 
and the electric field  on them

_  = 1 2  ( 1 + C V ) 
[ 2    ^(g) _ (  1 + C ) -
n-2 n - 3   V  ^(g) _  V ],
_ij   = ( 1 + C V 2  )^1n - 3  g_ij .
By  we shall denote all these components of the boundary of 
 which correspond to non-degenerate components of the event
horizons of the black hole.

If  we can paste 
 and 
 by indentifying  from 
with  from  using the identity map.
Then, we obtain
.
The metric defined on  can be extended by
continuity to smooth metric on , similarly
this can be done with the electric field. Thus, we set that
g _ij __+   = _ij +   
g _ij __-   = _ij - .
and consequently
E  __+  
= E _+ , 
E  __-  
= E _- .
In the case of , one has that , 
 and .
A tedious but simple calculations can envisage the following fact:
 ^(n - 1) _ij () = 2 _ ^ , 
  ^() _  ^  = 0,

where  is the covariant derivative with respect to the metric
. 
Eqs.() and ()
consist (as was observed for the first time in Ref.) the
constraint relations for a time symmetric problem.
Using the asymptotical behaviour of  and  
it could be observed
that as if we approach
 the line element  could be expressed as
ds^2_+  = ( 1 + + Q (n - 3) r^n-1   )
dx_i  dx^i  + O  ( 1 r^n - 2   ).
From Eq.() it follows in particular that,
the ADM mass is equal to . It can be verified
that,
the electric field is given by
_  = 1 2 2   [
- (n - 3) (n - 2)  ( + Q r^n - 2   ) ]
+ O  ( 1 r^n - 2   ).
On  the metric is as follows:
ds^2_-  =  1 2^2    [
+ Q r^n - 3   ]^2   dx_i  dx^i 
 + O  ( 1 r^n - 2   ),
where .

Further on, one can introduce the coordinates , where ,
so that the metric tensor  can be rewritten in the form
g_ij  = 1 W^2 dV^2 + _IJ  dx_I  dx^J .
From the exact form of  Eq.() 
and having in mind Eqs.() and ()
satisfied by them one can deduce that
the gauge potential is a function of , namely
. This fact in turn enables us to rewrite equations of motion as follows:
V  = V W    V  (
W   V  ), 

C^2 ( V  )^2 = V W    
V  ( W   ),
where .

Accordingly to Eqs.() and () we obtain
V  - C^2 ( V  )^3 = 
V ^2 V^2 .
From the above relation it follows in particular that
V  =  a V 1 + a^2 C^2 V^2  ,
where  is an integration constant.
Using the asymptotic behaviour of  we get the following expression:
_V 1  V  = - (n - 3)Q  .
Integrating Eq.() and taking the limit
 we arrive at the following 
expression for :
(V) = - ^2 + Q^2 (n -3)^2 (V^2 - 1)  (n - 3)C Q .
By virtue of Eq. () 
one can see that the Ricci tensor 
on the hypersurface is manifestly non-negative. Furthermore the asymptotic
behavoiur of the metric  on  becomes
_ij +  = _ij  + O ( 1 r^n - 2   ).
While on  it reduces to
_ij -  = [ ( + Q 2 )^1 n - 3  
1 r  ] _ij  +
O ( 1 r^2  ).
It follows directly from
Eq.() that the total mass on  vanishes.
Thus, as a consequence of the positive mass theorem
, the manifold  
is isometric to flat manifold. One 
 can rewrite  in a 
conformally flat formg_ij  = U ^1 n-3  _ij ,
where we have defined a smooth function on ,
namely .
One can show that the
Einstein-Maxwell equations of motion reduces
to the Laplace equation on the  Euclidean manifold 



where  is the connection on a flat manifold. 
Having in mind the above we can adopt for the metric 
in the flat base space the following metric:

_ij  dx^i dx^j  = ^2  dU ^2 + _AB dx^a dx^B .
First we shall consider the case of the single horizon.
The event horizon is located at  and
one can show that the embedding of  into the Euclidean
 space is totally umbilical. This embedding must be 
hyperspherical, i.e., each of the connected components of the horizon 
is a geometric sphere with a certain radius determined by the value of
,
where  is the coordinate which can be introduced on 
as follows:

One can always locate one 
connected component of the horizon at  surface without loss of generality.
Thus, we have to do with a boundary value problem for the Laplace equation 
on the base space  with the
Dirichlet boundary condition  and the asymptotic
decay condition .
Suppose further that
 and  be two solutions of the boundary value problem.
By means of the Green identity and integration over the volume element
we reach to the following expression:
( _r   - _H  ) 
( U _1  - U _2  ) r 
( U _1  - U _2  ) dS = _ 
( U _1  - U _2  ) ^2  d.
Because of the boundary condition the left-hand side vanishes, and we draw
a conclusion 
that two solutions must be identical.
The case of not single horizon can be treated as in Ref..
Namely, one should consider the evolution level surface in Euclidean space. 
From the Gauss equation in Euclidean space we shall obtain the evolution equation for 
shear
. Making use of the harmonicity of , i.e., , 
we can draw a conclusion that
_AB  = 0, D _A  = 0, D _A  k = 0,
where  denotes the covariant derivative on each level set of ,
 is the second fundamental form of the level set. This implies in turn that 
each level surface of  is totally umbilic and hence spherically symmetric.
As was mentioned in Ref. this is the local result, since one consider 
only the region without saddle points of the harmonic function . 
In order to achieve the global result one should take into account the
assumption about analyticity.
Now we turn to the problem of a charge of the connected components of black hole
event horizon
and its generalization to the non-connected case. 
In four-dimensions
Heusler showed that if all horizons were degenerate and ,
where   was the charge of the adequate connected component of black hole, 
then the black hole was a standard MP black hole. 
One should has in mind that a standard connected MP
black hole is an extreme RN one.
First,
if we suppose that , where , is a 
connected components of  such that the 
electrical
potentials of the horizons
 imply
_1  = _  < 0, _2  = _  > 0.
Then as was shown in  of the  are non-vanishing and have 
the opposite signs.
It can be verified by writing out the expression for
the charge  
Q_a  = - _i   _S_a,i  
C ^i  V dS_i .
and using the divergence theorem and maximum principle (see for the details).
By exactly similar arguments as presented in workwe can treat the case of a non-connected . Finally, the 
above considerations enable us to formulate the main conclusion
of our work.

Theorem: 

Let us consider a static solution to the -dimensional Einstein-Maxwell
equations of motion with an asymptotically timelike Killing vector field .
Suppose further that the manifold under consideration consists 
of a connected and simply connected
spacelike hypersurface  to which  is orthogonal. The topological
boundary  of  is a nonempty topological manifold with
 on .
Then, one arrives at the following conclusions:

 
If  is connected, then there exist a neighbourhood of  which is
diffeomorphic to an open subset of -dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom 
spacetime (extreme or non-extreme). 
If  is not connected ad moreover we have 
fulfilled the following inequality:
_i, j   Q_i Q_j  0,
where  is the charge of the adequate component of 
, that intersects the degenerate horizon, then there is
an open neighbourhood of  which is diffeomorphic to -dimensional
Majumdar-Papapetrou spacetime.
