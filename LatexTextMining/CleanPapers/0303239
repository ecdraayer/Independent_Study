 ABSTRACT
We show that the on-shell S-matrix elements of four open string
massless scalars, two scalars and two tachyons, and four open
string  tachyons in the super string theory can be written in a
unique form. We then propose an off-shell extension for the
S-matrix element of four scalars which is consistent, in the low
energy limit,  with the Dirac-Born-Infeld effective action. Using
a similar off-shell extension for the S-matrix element of two
scalars and two tachyons and for the S-matrix element of four
tachyons, we show that they are fully consistent with the
tachyonic DBI action. The idea  Recently different tachyonic effective actions has been used to
describe the time evolution of unstable D-branes in string
theory(For early studies of
open string tachyon dynamics, see.) . In particular, Sen
has shown that the string theory produces a pressure-less gas with
non-zero energy density at the late time of the tachyon
condensation. In this paper, he  showed that these
results can be derived also from the tachyonic
Dirac-Born-Infeld(DBI) effective action around its
true vacuum. Other possible applications of this action to
cosmology have been discussed in. The
tachyonic DBI action was first found  by analyzing  the low energy
behaviour of the amplitude describing scattering of two tachyons
to one graviton on the noncommutative world-volume of a non-BPS
D-branes in superstring theory. Then it was shown
that the action is consistent with T-duality rules, and has
expected solitonic solutions.


In inferring effective action from on-shell  string theory
S-matrix elements, one usually evaluates the  S-matrix elements
and  expands them in the limit , low
energy limit. Then one writes a low energy effective action in
the field theory that its corresponding on-shell S-matrix elements
reproduce the leading order terms of the expansion. The
low energy expansion of the on-shell S-matrix elements are
unique, however, many apparently different but physically
identical low energy actions may produce them. These actions may
in turn be
 related to each other by some field
redefinition. Alternatively, one may try to extend
appropriately   the on-shell S-matrix elements to different
off-shell amplitudes and then expand them in the low energy limit.
Each amplitude  can be reproduced in field theory by a unique
action. These actions should then be related to each other by some
field redefinition.   For example, consider the S-matrix element
of one closed string tachyon and two open string tachyons in Type
0 theory:
 A(,T,T)&&((-2s) (-s)(-s) ),
where  and  stand for the closed string
and open string tachyon, respectively. Also  
, and  are momenta of the open string
tachyons which satisfy the on-shell condition
. One may analytically off-shell extends
this amplitude to A^off 
(,T,T)&&((-2s) (-s)(-s) 
+1/4-k_2)),
att1 where the tachyon momenta do not satisfy the
on-shell condition anymore, and the function , having
only some contact terms of order , must be
symmetric under  and vanishes on-shell.
 Obviously  the off-shell amplitude att1  reduces to the
on-shell amplitude att  upon imposing  the on-shell
condition . The low energy expansion,
, of att1  is A^off (,T,T)&&(1/4+k_2/2+O(The first two
terms  are reproduced exactly by the tachyonic DBI
action(We have used the fact that the
closed string tachyon in Type 0 theory normalizes the D-brane
tension as , and
we have kept only linear term for the closed string tachyon.) 
S&=&-T_p 4 dxV(T)-(_ab +2T_b T) ,


&=&-T_p 4 dx(1-T^2/2+ T)^2+), where in the second line we have used the
expansion  at the top of  the
tachyon potential in this action. Note that to evaluate the
off-shell S-matrix elements in field theory we do not use the
on-shell conditions for external states in Feynman diagrams,
however, we do use the conservation of momentum. The terms of
order  in att2  are related to higher
derivative terms which are not included in tachyonic action
above(The higher derivative terms may have significant
effect at the top of potential, however, according to the results
in they are not important at the minimum of tachyon
potential.) . Now consider the following  off-shell extension of
the  amplitude att : A^off (,T,T)&&(1+2k_1k_2) (1/2+k_1k_2)(1/2+k_1k_2) +g(k_1,k_2),where function ,
having only some contact terms of order , is zero
on-shell. Again it is obvious that this off-shell amplitude
reduces to the on-shell amplitude att  upon imposing the
on-shell condition. At low energy this amplitude has the following
expansion: A^off && 1/4+k_2+O(att3 In this case, the first
two terms of this expansion are reproduced exactly by BSFT
action S&=&-T_p 4 dx e^-T^2/4  (T)^2/2+1) (T)^2/2+1/2) ,bsft 

&=&-T_p 4 dx (1-T^2/4+T)^2+).Again the terms of order
 in att3  are related to the higher derivative
terms which are not included in the BSFT action. One expects that
the two actions dbiac  and bsft  to be related to
each other by some field redefinition.

Now using the idea that one can off-shell extend the S-matrix
elements, the question is how to off-shell extend a S-matrix
element? The particular case that we are interested in is how to
off-shell extend S-matrix elements involving open string
tachyons? The guiding principle  that we follow is the similarity
between on-shell S-matrix elements involving  massless scalars and
the on-shell S-matrix elements involving tachyons. We extend this
similarity to the off-shell amplitudes as well.  We off-shell
extend the amplitudes involving only scalars  in  such a way that
they are consistent with the DBI action in the low energy limit.
Then we use a similar off-shell amplitude for the cases that
involve tachyons. As a simple example consider the S-matrix
element of one closed string tachyon and two open string massless
scalar states. The amplitude is given by
(Using the fact that the closed strings are
not functional of the open string tachyon but are functional of
the scalar fields, we assumed that the closed string
field does not depend on the scalar. This makes similar the
S-matrix elements involving the scalars and the tachyon as much
as possible.) , A(,X,X)&&_1_2((-2s) (-s)(-s) )
,axxon where , and
 and  are the scalar polarizations
and momenta, respectively(Our index conventions are that
early Latin indices take values in the world-volume, , and middle Latin indices take values in the
transverse space, .) . The momenta in this
amplitude satisfy the on-shell condition . Note
that apart from the polarization of the scalar fields, the
on-shell amplitude att  and axxon  are similar.
Off-shell extension for the above amplitude which is correspond
to the DBI action is A^off (,X,X)&&_1_2((-2s) (-s)(-s) +G-G^on   +
h(k_1,k_2)) ,axxoff where the function
 is G&=&
-and 
means the function  in which the momenta are on-shell.
Obviously it is zero in this case. The momenta in axxoff 
do not satisfy the on-shell conditions and the function
, having only some contact terms of order
, must be symmetric under  and
must be zero on-shell. This function is related to the higher
derivative terms in the DBI action. The low energy expansion, , of this amplitude is A^off &&_1_2(k_2/2+O().The first term above is reproduced in
field theory by the  DBI action as required, and 
terms are related to the higher derivative terms which are not
included in the DBI action. Now the off-shell amplitude
att1  is similar to the off-shell amplitude axxoff ,
A^off 
(,T,T)&&((-2s) (-s)(-s)  +G-G^on   +f(k_1, k_2)). att11 In this case
. This off-shell amplitude is consistent with
the tachyonic DBI action as we saw above.  In the present paper we
would like to extend these idea to the case of S-matrix elements
of four tachyons and/or scalars in the superstring theory in the
presence of background B-flux.

In section 2, we recall the string theory S-matrix element of four
scalar vertex operators. We propose an off-shell extension for
this amplitude and then expand it  at low energy. We show that
its leading order terms are reproduced exactly by the
corresponding off-shell amplitude in field theory based on the DBI
action. In section 3, we show that   the on-shell S-matrix element
of two scalar and two tachyon vertex operators is similar to the
on-shell S-matrix element of four scalars. Hence we write an
off-shell S-matrix elements that is similar to the one in section
2. In  section 4 we do the same thing for the S-matrix element of
four tachyons. The proposed off-shell amplitudes in sections 3
and 4 are  correspond to the tachyonic DBI action.

Four  scalars amplitude  Scattering amplitude of four
vector vertex operators in superstring theory is evaluated in
, and its low energy effective action is also studied,
for example, in. To find the amplitude corresponding to
four scalar vertex operators, one may use the result in
 in which the vector polarizations  are replaced
by the scalar polarizations . Since we are interested in
the scattering amplitude in the presence of B-flux, one should
use  as the world volume metric, and
also should add an appropriate  phase factor to the amplitudes in
one cycling of the vertex operators with the non-commutative
parameter tensor 
. Adding all non-cyclic permutation of the vertex
operators, one ends up with the following amplitude: A(_1,_2,_3,_4)&=&A_s(_1,_2,_3,_4)+A_u
(_1,_2,_3,_4)+ A_t(_1,_2,_3,_4),
where , and  are the part of the
amplitude that  has  massless pole in -, - and -channels,
respectively. They are

),aton where
 for
, and variables  are the
following:s&=&-t&=&-mandel 


u&=&-Using on-shell
condition for the momenta, one finds that these Mandelstam
variables satisfy the on-shell relation . We have also
normalized the amplitude by the factor 
where .  The amplitudes ,  and
 are very similar, so we only off-shell extend the 
amplitude. The off-shell extension of  and  should then
be straightforward.

To find the off-shell extension of  we use the following
criteria: 

1)-The amplitude should have poles at ,
corresponding to propagation of  the infinite tower of open
string states in the amplitude.

2)-Imposing on-shell conditions, the amplitude must reduce to the
on-shell amplitude .

3)-In the low energy expansion of the amplitude, its massless
pole and its contact terms up to  should produce
the corresponding pole and contact terms of the DBI field theory
amplitude.


Unlike the amplitude axxon  in which the Mandelstam
variable  is arbitrary, the Mandelstam variables in
aton  are constraint by the on-shell condition .
Now it raises the question that how we write the gamma functions
in aton  in the off-shell amplitude. To do so, we first,
using the on-shell condition ,  write the on-shell
amplitude in a unique form that all other amplitudes involving the
tachyon  can also be converted to. It turns out that the gamma
function in  should be written in the following form: (-2t)(1-2s) (-2t-2s) &=&
(-2t)(1+t+u-s) (u-s-t) ,

(1-2s)(1-2u) (1-2s-2u) &=&
(1+t+u-s)(1+s+t-u) (1+2t) ,

(-2t)(1-2u) (-2t-2u) &=&
(-2t)(1+t+s-u) (s-u-t) .gamma1 Writing the gamma functions in aton  in the above form, we
propose the following off-shell amplitude for :  A_t^off

function  has been added to the amplitude to
cancel the non-desire contact terms resulting from expansion of
the gamma functions in the low energy limit. It has the following
contact terms of order :F&=&-6  (i=1 ^4 k_i^2)^2/4
+(k_1^2+k_4^2)t+(k_1^2+k_3^2)u+(k_1^2+k_2^2)s.

&&.+k_3(k_1^2+k_4^2)-k_3(k_2^2+k_4^2)-k_2(k_3^2+k_4^2)).F  means
function  in which the momenta are on-shell. It is easy to see
that this is zero in this case.   Functions
,
having only some contact terms of order , must be
zero on-shell. These functions are related to the higher
derivative corrections to the DBI action in which we are not
interested in the present paper. Using conservation of momentum,
the Mandelstam variables in the off-shell case satisfy the
relation: s+t+u&=&-i=1 ^4 k_i^2)/2.mandel1 Its is obvious that this off-shell amplitude satisfies the first
two criteria above. To check the last criterion, we should expand
the amplitude in the low energy. The gamma functions in this
amplitude at  have the following expansion:
(-2t)(1+t+u-s) (u-s-t) &=&1 2 +s-u 2t -
^2 6 ((s-u)^2-t^2)+O((-2t)(1+t+s-u) (s-u-t) &=&1 2 +u-s 2t -
^2 6 ((s-u)^2-t^2)+O((1+t+u-s)(1+s+t-u) (1+2t) 
&=&1+^2 6 ((s-u)^2-t^2)+
O(gamma Replacing these expansion
for the gamma functions into atoff , one finds massless
pole and some contact terms at each order of .

Now in  field theory, using the non-commutative DBI action, one
finds the following massless
 -channel amplitude (see  for details): A_t'^off 
&=&(__2_3A )^a(_A)_ab (_A_1_4 )

&&.+(e^il_14 +il_23  +e^il_13 +il_24  )(u-s 2t 
)).atfield In reaching to this result, we
have used only conservation of momentum. It easy to see that the
massless pole of the string theory off-shell amplitude
atoff  produces exactly the corresponding amplitude in the
field theory. Now subtracting the field theory massless pole from
the string theory  amplitude, one ends up with the following
contact terms in the -channel: A_t^off -A_t'^off  &=&-icT_p 2^2_2_3att' 

&&(  (e^il_12 +il_34   +e^il_14 -il_23  )(1 2 -^2 6 ((s-u)^2-t^2)+F+O

the  and , one finds the following total off-shell

no momentum and is zero when the background B-flux vanishes, A_c^0&=&-icT_p 2^2il_12 +il_34   +e^il_14 -il_23  )(1 2 _1_4_2_3

 with  contains contact terms with more than four
momenta. We refer  readers to for comparing  the
contact terms  and  with the noncommutative DBI
action. Here we consider only the simple case that the background
field . In this case, , the phase factors in 
reduce to number 6 and . Expanding the square
root of determinant, one finds that the tachyonic DBI action has
the following four scalars coupling:S&=&-T_pd^p+1 xV(T)-(_ab +_aX^i_bX_i+

&=&-T_pd^p+1 x
(-1 4 (_aX^i_bX_i)(^bX_j^aX^j)+
1 8 (_aX^i^aX_i)^2+).
It is easy to verify that couplings above exactly
reproduce the contact terms of  when . Note that in
reaching to this result, one does not need to use the on-shell
conditions for external states. This confirms that the off-shell
amplitude atoff  is consistent with the DBI action.



Two scalars and two tachyons amplitude  The amplitude
describing scattering of two tachyons to two scalars on the
world-volume of a non-commutative non-BPS D-brane is
evaluated in. This amplitude has only massless pole in
the -channel , that is
 A(_2,_3)=A_t(_2,_3)&= &
-icT_p (  (-2t)(1/2- 2s) 
 (-1/2-2t-2s) (e^il_12 +il_34

&&.+(-2t)(1/2-2u) (-1/2-2t-2u) (e^il_14 +il_23  +e^il_13 +il_24  )   
),atone where we have normalized the
amplitude here by the factor . The Mandelstam
variables  defined in mandel , and they satisfy the
on-shell condition .

Using  relation  in atone , one can write the
gamma functions in atone  as those appearing in
gamma1 , (-2t)(1/2-2s) (-1/2-2t-2s) &=&
(-2t)(1+t+u-s) (u-s-t) ,

(1/2-2s)(1/2-2u) (-2s-2u) &=&
(1+t+u-s)(1+s+t-u) (1+2t) ,

(-2t)(1/2-2u) (-1/2-2t-2u) &=&
(-2t)(1+t+s-u) (s-u-t) .gamma2 Using these form for the gamma  functions in atone , one
can see that the on-shell amplitudes atone  and aton 
can be written in exactly the same form. Now using the guiding
principle the the off-shell amplitude should also be similar, we
propose the following off-shell extension for the amplitude
atone : A_t^off  
&=&-icT_p

given by F  in which  are momenta of the scalar
states and  are momenta of the tachyons. 
means function  in which the momenta are on-shell. It has the
following value: F^on  &=&-^2 6 k_3.Functions
 in
atoff1  must be zero on-shell. We expect them to be related
to the higher derivative terms in the tachyonic DBI action in
which we are not interested in this paper. So from now on we
ignore them.  The Madelstam variables in the off-shell amplitude
atoff1  satisfy mandel1 . Obviously the amplitude
atoff1  has expected infinite tower of poles in the
-channel, and reduces to atone  upon imposing the
on-shell conditions.


 Using
the low energy expansion gamma  for the gamma functions in
atoff1  one finds massless pole and some contact terms at
each order of . Now in  field theory,  since the kinetic
term of tachyon in the tachyonic DBI action biact  is
exactly like the kinetic term of the massless scalar field, with
different normalization 
,  the massless -channel pole for
scattering two scalars to two tachyons is exactly like the
off-shell amplitude atfield  in which
. This pole is exactly the
massless pole of the string theory amplitude atoff1 .
Subtracting the massless pole of atoff1 , one finds the
following contact terms:
  A_c^off  
(_2,_3)&=&A_c^0(_2,_3)+A_c^4(_2,_3)+,
where   includes the contact terms that
have no momentum and is zero when the background field vanishes,
A_c^0&=&-icT_p 1 2 (e^

&&.-(e^il_13 -il_24   +e^il_12 -il_34  )+1 2 (e^il_14 +il_23

is non-zero even when ,  A_c^4

-4icT_p 3il_12 +il_34

&&_2_3(4 (k_2k_3)(k_1k_4)-4 (k_1k_2)(k_3k_4)-4 (k_1k_3)(k_2k_4)+8 (k_2k_3) )ac42 The
dots in ac  are the  terms of the gamma
function expansion and the  functions in atoff1 .
Again we refer readers to for comparing  the contact
terms  and  above with the noncommutative DBI
action. Here we consider only the simple case that the background
field . The tachyonic DBI action biact  has the
following
 terms: L  (X,X,T,T)&=&-T_p (- 4 T^2

.lpptt 

&&.-2 (_aX^i_aX_i)(_bT^bT)),
It is easy to see  that the coupling in the first
line produce the term in ac42  which has two momenta, and
the couplings in the second line above reproduce the other terms
in ac42 . This confirms that the off-shell amplitude
atoff1  is consistent with the tachyonic DBI action, and the
expectation that the function  are related to the
higher derivative terms in this action, their 
expansion does not have constant and term proportional to
.

Four tachyons amplitude  The amplitude describing
scattering of two tachyons to two other tachyons on the
world-volume of a non-commutative non-BPS D-brane is
evaluated in. This amplitude has massless pole in all
-, - and -channels, that is, A&=&A_s+A_u+
A_t.However, in this case the amplitudes in
all channels are identical , and
 A_t&=&-2icT_p(  
(-2t)(-2s) (-1-2s-2t) (e^il_12 +il_34  
+e^il_14 -il_23  ).

&&-(-2s)(-2u) (-1-2s-2u) (e^il_13 -il_24  +e^il_12 -il_34  )

&&.+(-2t)(-2u) (-1-2t-2u) (e^il_14 +il_23  +e^il_13 +il_24  )   
),atttt where we have normalized the
amplitude by the factor . The variables
  satisfy the on-shell condition .

Again using  relation  in atttt , one can write
the gamma functions in it as those appearing in gamma1 , (-2t)(-2s) (-1-2t-2s) &=&
(-2t)(1+t+u-s) (u-s-t) ,

(-2s)(-2u) (-1-2s-2u) &=&
(1+t+u-s)(1+s+t-u) (1+2t) ,

(-2t)(-2u) (-1-2t-2u) &=&
(-2t)(1+t+s-u) (s-u-t) .Using
these form for the gamma  functions in atttt ,
gamma2  for the gamma functions in atone  and
gamma1  for the gamma functions in aton , one can
easily see that the on-shell amplitudes atttt ,
atone  and aton  can be written in exactly the same
form. Now using the guiding principle that the off-shell
amplitudes should also be similar, we propose the following
off-shell extension for the amplitude atttt : A_t^off  &=&-2icT_p((  
(-2t)(1+t+u-s) (u-s-t) +F-F^on  
+f")(e^il_12 +il_34  
+e^il_14 -il_23  ).

&&-((1+t+u-s)(1+s+t-u) (1+2t) -F+F^on  
-g") (e^il_13 -il_24  +e^il_12 -il_34  )

&&.+((-2t)(1+t+s-u) (s-u-t) +F-F^on   +h") (e^il_14 +il_23  +e^il_13 +il_24  )    ),atoff2 where  is
given by F  in which all the momenta are the tachyon
momenta.  in this case isF^on  &=&-^2 6 (k_2k_3+k_1k_4+1 2 ).Functions

must be zero on-shell. We expect them to be related to the higher
derivative terms in the tachyonic DBI action in which we are not
interested in the present paper. So we ignore them from now on. It
is obvious that the off-shell amplitude atoff2  has the
expected infinite tower of poles in the -channel, and reduces
to atttt  upon imposing on-shell conditions.

Using the low energy expansion gamma  for the gamma
functions in atoff2 , one finds massless pole and some
contact terms at each order of . In field theory, the
massless pole is again exactly like atfield  in which
.
Subtracting it from the off-shell amplitude atoff2  and
repeating the same analysis for  and , one finds the
following total contact terms: A_c^off  &=&
-8^2icT_p 3 

&&(e^il_12 +il_34   +e^il_14 -il_23  +e^il_13 -il_24   +e^il_12 -il_34  +e^il_14 +il_23   +e^il_13 +il_24  )

&&(-4 (k_2k_3)(k_1k_4)
-4 (k_1k_2)(k_3k_4)-4 (k_1k_3)(k_2k_4).ac43 

&&.+ 8 (k_2k_3+k_1k_4+k_1k_3+k_2k_4+k_1k_2+k_3k_4)+
3 16 )+,where dots represent
the  terms of the gamma function  and functions
.  Here again to compare it with the tachyonic DBI
action for the case that , one should replace the phase
factor above by number 6 and . The action
biact  has the following terms: L  (T,T,T,T)&=&-T_p( T^4-^22 T^2(_aT^aT)-
^22 (_aT^aT)^2),
ltttt where  the constant  is the
coefficient of  in the tachyon potential. One can easily
observe that the term with four derivatives reproduces exactly the
four momentum contact terms in ac43 , term with two
derivatives reproduces the two momentum contact terms, and the
 term produces the constant term in ac43  provided that
.


 The tachyon potential expanded around its
maximum, around , has then the following expansion:
V(T)=1- 2 T^2+^2 8 T^4+O(T^6).finalv 
On the other hand A. Sen has shown that  the  tachyon
potential in the tachyonic DBI action  has minimum at
, and the behavior of the potential
around the minimum should be like 
(Note that the convention
in sets .) . A  tachyon potential with this
 behavior at  ,
and expansion finalv  at the maximum of potential has been
suggested in. Our calculation however does not rule
out the possibility of other expansion  for the potential. This
stems from the fact that functions  in atoff2 
which must be zero on-shell, might have a constant term in their
 expansion.  Another potential which has the above
expansion around maximum is the following: V(T)&=&e^-T^2/2 .This potential  is consistent with the
sigma model effective action.

Extending the similarity between the tachyon and scalar to the
higher derivative terms as well, one might expect that the
functions  in atoff1  to be related to the
functions  in atoff  as 
, and similarly the
functions  in atoff2  as 
. This means that the higher
derivative corrections to the tachyonic DBI action  and  the
higher derivative terms of DBI action have the same structure.
Similar speculation, in other context, has  been also made in

Finally to compare the low energy expansion of the off-shell
amplitudes considered in this paper with  the on-shell amplitudes
considered in, one should not that in the off-shell
case the Mandelstam variables are all independent. Hence at low
energy they all go to zero, as we have considered in this paper.
Whereas the on-shell relation like mandel1  constrains  the
variables  not to be  independent anymore in the on-shell
amplitudes. In this case one should write the amplitudes in terms
of only independent variables then expands  them at the low
energy. For instance, as it has been done in, for
studying  at low energy one writes  in terms of  and
. Then expands the amplitude at 
. In this regards, both the off-shell amplitudes proposed in
this paper  and the on-shell amplitudes gives the same low energy
expansion.
