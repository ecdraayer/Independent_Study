We study the regularization of theories of "brane induced" 
gravity in codimension . 
The brane can be interpreted as a thin  dielectric with a 
large dielectric constant, embedded in a higher dimensional space.
The kinetic term for the 
higher dimensional graviton is enhanced over the brane.
A four  dimensional gravitation is found on the brane at 
distances smaller  than a critical distance , 
and is due to the exchange of a massive resonant graviton. 
The crossover scale   is determined by the mass of the resonance. 
The suppression of the couplings of light 
Kaluza-Klein modes to brane matter results in a 
higher dimensional force law at large distances. 
We show that the resulting theory is free of ghosts or tachyons.






 Introduction 




Brane world  theories with large or infinite extra dimension provide 
insight into a number of problems of high energy physics, cosmology and 
possible relations between them . 
Those models may ultimately emerge as a part of
a fundamental higher dimensional theory like string theory.

The idea that our universe may have infinite extra dimensions was rejected 
for a long time as being incompatible with the observed 4D nature 
of gravity. Since gravity
probes all dimensions, the force between objects localized on a  
dimensional
hyper surface would be higher dimensional. Nevertheless, 
it was pointed out in that, in the presence of a brane in 5D space, the ordinary 5D 
action of gravity is modified by a 4D Einstein-Hilbert on the brane.
This term is compatible with all the symmetries of the theory and, therefore,
can be generated by quantum corrections. 
This model, also known as the  DGP (Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati) model, 
is an example of a theory of "brane induced gravity." There, gravity is
4D below a certain scale , ranging from galactic to horizon size.  
 One major problem of this scenario, related to the existence of  
singularities in off-shell trilinear interactions of longitudinal 
gravitons , was pointed out in  
(see also ). There, it was shown that radiative corrections to 
DGP become uncontrollably large at a very low energy scale, 
. This scale is essentially a cutoff beyond which the DGP
model needs a UV completion. A similar problem should arise also in codimension
greater than one, in analogy with the UV behavior of massive gravity .
We will not address this problem in this paper, but we will concentrate on 
another, simpler one. Namely, the proper definition and regularization 
of induced gravity in codimension .

Setting aside the strong-coupling problem just mentioned here, 
brane induced gravity in five dimensions is compatible with
all present measurement and observations  and allows the scale of
5D 
quantum gravity  to be as low as eV . Choosing  to
be the horizon radius,  is instead eV. In higher codimension, 
 depends on the UV regularization scale, i.e. on the thickness of the 
brane. It is natural to choose this thickness to be ; in this case 
 becomes . 

The investigation of brane induced gravity in a  space with more than one 
infinite extra dimension is interesting because  that framework may provide a 
solution to the cosmological constant problem. 


Brane induced gravity in space with  transverse 
dimensions is described by the action:

big 
S=M_* ^2+N d^4 xd^N YG R _4+N +
M_P ^2d^4 xd^N Y^N (Y)g R _4 ,
where  are coordinates of  
infinite extra dimensions, and the brane
is taken to be infinitesimally thin 
and located at the origin.  is the D curvature,
 is the D metric,  is the 4D curvature 
constructed from the induced metric
on the brane . 
The philosophy behind  brane induced gravity is that there are two scales in 
the theory. A scale for bulk gravity , 
and a much higher scale , which characterizes the physics on the 
brane, i.e. the standard model  and possible extensions like SUSY and GUTs. 
In order to obtain the correct value of Newtons constant, 
is taken to be GeV.

Calculating the Green function and KK spectrum of () for the case 
 is straightforward. The task is less clear for  due to 
singularities that appear because of the zero thickness of the brane, and the
resulting singularities in the Green functions for  . 

In this paper  we study a simple regularization of the action Eq.(). 
We propose to consider an action for -dimensional gravity, 
reminiscent of the action for a dielectric  in electrodynamics:
 SM_*^2+N  = 
_ <   d^4+N  x G_4+N     
R _4+N + _ >  
 d^4+N  x  G_4+N   R _4+N ,
with  a large dimensionless quantity (to be defined more precisely 
in the text),  the radial coordinate in the  transverse dimensions,
and  the width of the brane.

The brane in this theory is a thin "gravitational" dielectric.  
We will prove that, at distances smaller than a certain critical scale  
and for , the 
gravitational interaction is mediated by a massive resonant graviton, whereas 
at larger distances one rediscovers -dimensional gravitation.  


We will also investigate smooth versions of this scenario. 
This is achieved by taking a varying "dielectric constant." 
A scalar action of this kind was considered in , where it was 
pointed out that this kind of action can be realized physically in a 
dilaton gravity theory. 

We thus consider the action of generalized to arbitrary codimensions:

act1 
SM_* ^2+N  =d^4 xd^N YG [
1+F (/)]R _4+N ,
where  is the shape of the brane, which we take to
depend only on the radial coordinate  of the  transverse dimensions.
Again,  is the width of the brane  and  is a large, 
dimensionless parameter. 
The action Eq. () is obtained from Eq. () by
choosing for the profile the step function .

The action Eq. () describes a smooth 3-brane in a 
-dimensional space. 
We will show that for sufficiently large values of , the effect of 
this brane "dielectric" constant is  to convert the higher dimensional laws 
of gravity to four-dimensional laws at short distances. 

On  physical grounds one does not expect that the introduction of a "medium" 
(i.e. a brane) into the higher dimensional vacuum will result in the 
appearance of ghosts
or tachyons and make the theory inconsistent. 
We will explicitly show this for the model (). 
A brane with smoothly changing permeability, , 
can be thought of as a succession of as a sequence of small regions of 
constant , and hence the proof should also hold for smooth 
. 

The action Eq. () may  provide a physical realization of 
Eq. (). One can think of it as gravity coupled to a scalar that gets 
a non-constant vacuum expectation value, in the form of a topological defect 
(domain wall, string, monopole etc.).

This paper is organized as follows. 
In the first section we consider the scalar equivalent of action 
Eq. (). We analytically calculate the scalar field  resonances 
and show that they lead to the crossover distance between 4-dimensional and 
higher dimensional behavior for the force they mediate. 
We do that by studying the KK modes of the fields and prove that their 
coupling to the "dielectric" is determined by their wave function on the 
brane, for an appropriately chosen source. 
We will see that, generically, the coupling of heavy modes is strongly 
suppressed on the brane, and that the coupling of the modes is sharply peaked 
around a value, , which is the mass of the effective 4-dimensional 
scalar "graviton." 
 
Next, we take a specific choice of a smooth brane and see that even there
the scalar "graviton" is a massive resonance. Numerical results show that 
the behavior is the same as with the sharp-boundary dielectric. 
This shows that the regularization considered here is really shape 
independent. 

In Section 4, we investigate the tensor structure of our regularized theory. 
We show that in the model () the 4 dimensional massive  
graviton propagates with the correct degrees of freedom - i.e. the mass term 
generated in this theory has the Pauli-Fierz form. 
There are no ghost or tachyons propagating in our system, unlike in the
regularization proposed in . 

Section 5 summarizes the findings of this paper.

As we previously mentioned, its was pointed out in  
and  that the DGP theory suffers from strong-coupling problems, 
as is typical for theories with massive gravitons. 
Our regularization, of course, does not cure that problem. 



 
A Dielectric Brane with a Sharp Boundary 
We start by looking at a model in which we imagine a thin 
"dielectric" with a sharp boundary, and dielectric constant   
centered around the origin of the transverse -dimensional space. 
 The results are
easily generalized to smooth branes (smooth variation of the "dielectric" 
constant) by taking that  changes in small steps. 
 We are interested in whether this system exhibit a 4-dimensional 
behavior in a certain region of distance (or energy) scales. 

Let us analyze this system first for  the simplest case; a scalar field. 
Consider the following action ():
 
where we define the dimensionless quantity  as follows:
 
a definition guaranteeing that in the limit 
, , 
we approach the delta function limit.  is the radial coordinate in the
extra N-dimensional space. 
To find a solution to this system, we solve the equation of motion in the
two different regions, and impose the matching conditions at the boundary of 
the sphere. One obtains:
 
and the boundary condition:
^I &=& ^o _ 

 _^I &=& _^o 
_ m1 
If we decompose the field in Kaluza-Klein modes, 
, 
, the equations of motion and the boundary 
condition on the sphere reduce to equations for each one of the modes:





 











We must make some important remarks at this point. 
We are interested in the coupling of the KK modes to the matter on the brane, 
which is given by the convolution of the wave function and the matter profile 
.
convo1 
 _m (0)=_<  d^4+N Y ( Y)_m (Y).
Now we can assume that  the profile of the matter fields is 
spherically symmetric in the extra dimensions, 
. We can take that the  standard model matter is given 
by zero modes of some fields with characteristic scale . 
Those zero modes have spherically symmetric profiles in the  transverse
dimensions.
The excited states with nonzero angular momentum  have masses which are 
naturally of order , so that they decouple from low energy physics. 
That is why we can assume that only KK modes with   couple to the 
"spherically" symmetric brane matter. When calculating the tree level
exchange, we are taking into account only a 
single tower of radial KK excitations.

Since we can assume that the matter profiles are sharply peaked around the 
origin, the coupling of the KK modes is approximately given by .

We look at the case of codimension 1 first. The DGP model is perfectly 
regular for , 
so we expect to discover the same results as obtained in .


The general solution to the 5D equations of motion is 
(using plane wave normalization):
 
The odd modes do not couple significantly 
to matter located on the brane, as explained in the previous paragraph.
A straightforward calculation yields the following equation for :
 
On the other hand  is given by:
 
Since we are interested in four-dimensional distances larger than the width 
of the brane, modes
heavier than  decouple. 
Later we will take that . Since  is
the cutoff of the effective field theory for the bulk 
gravity, we take . 
Then we can approximate ,
so we find for :
 
Using the definition of  (), we see that 
, where . 
As explained above, the coupling of
the Kaluza Klein mode  of mass  to the brane matter is given by:  
  
We see that we get a resonance, and that for
 the coupling is strongly suppressed. 
The result is independent of the
shape of the brane  and it is exactly what is found in the 
DGP model , as we anticipated. In ref  
it was explained how this resonance leads to a  potential for 
 and to a  potential for  .

Now consider for instance the case of codimension . 
The theory with a delta function type brane
is known to have singular behavior in this case.  Let us apply our 
regularization prescription to this case. 
We expect a regularization ()  dependent result in this case.
The solution in the two regions is:
   
The  solution is determined by asking for regularity at .
We keep only the  terms in the expansion in spherical harmonics as 
explained before.
Boundary conditions give the following equations:
     
Expanding the cotangent, we get:
   
We obtain for the amplitude:
 
The amplitude squared is a sharply peaked function around its maximum, obtained
at . This gives, using our definition of
, .  
The coupling of the modes, given by the wavefunction squared, is now 
. We must emphasize that the fact that 
 is singular at its maximum is due to our approximation. 
Indeed, the denominator receives corrections at , 
which gives : 
a finite and -independent result.  For KK modes
with mass larger than , the coupling to the brane is heavily suppressed. 
In this case we find that   is  dependent, as 
we anticipated before. 

For , one might take the natural value , 
in which case the crossover distance and the graviton width become 
cros3 
r_c m_g ^-1 M_P M_*^2 ,
_m_g M_* ^3 M_P ^2 .
This is exactly what is found for the regularized delta-function type brane 
theory regularized
with higher derivative operators . 
In Fig. 1 we show the value of the wave function
 that is roughly the coupling of KK modes to the brane matter.


file=JW.eps,width=9cm  
Figure 1:  Wave functions of KK modes on the brane 
for . 
The scalar "graviton" is a very sharp massive resonance. 
Inset: light modes are suppressed as  , giving rise
to a  potential at large distances. 





In codimension , the  effective 4-D "graviton" 
is a very narrow resonance. The crossover from 4D to 7D behavior does not 
happen because of graviton "decay." At large distances, the 
4D "graviton" simply becomes too heavy to contribute to the tree-level 
exchange. 

At large distances  we evaluate the potential from the
coupling of light KK modes to brane matter. Their coupling is suppressed
linearly  and the potential is:

7dpo 
V_New (r)_0 ^ m^2 M_* ^5  
(-mr) r dm1 M_* ^5 1 r^4 
,rr_c .
This is just the 7D potential that appear at distances larger than 
the crossover distance.

At short distances, the Newtonian potential  between two masses,  
due to exchange of KK modes, , is dominated by the 
exchange of the lowest-mass resonance. 
So we can approximate our integral by the area of the resonance peak.
This gives:
7dpoa 
V_New (r)_m_g-_m_g  ^m_g+_m_g  
_m (0)^2  M_* ^5  (-mr) r dm 1 M_P^2  1 r 
rr_c .
We see that the weak four dimensional gravity is due to the exchange of a 
massive resonant "graviton." 





A Smooth  Dielectric Brane 

In this section we study the 4D effective field theory of a scalar system in 
which the kinetic term of a bulk field is not homogeneous through extra 
dimensions. We shall obtain results qualitatively similar to the ones obtained
in the previous Section. As we remarked earlier, a smooth "dielectric" 
constant may be achieved in dilaton  gravity theories. The reader not
interested in the details of this regularization can skip this section and 
proceed to Section 4, where the sharp-boundary approximation is applied to
true spin-2 gravity.

The action that describes a scalar in a smoothly varying "dielectric" medium is

firstl 
L =M_*^2+N  f(Y_i )_A ^A .
We take  the localizing profile  to be a spherically
symmetric function of radial variable in  extra dimensions. 
For the system Eq.()
that we are studying the localizing profile  is

f 
f(/)=1+F (/).
As before, we are interested in the four dimensional spectrum of 
Eq. (), and we decompose the field 
into its Kaluza Klein modes
m2  
(x_ ,Y_i )=_m _m (Y_i )_m (x_ ), 
_4 _m =m^2_m .
The differential equation for wave functions  is

ekv 
f()_N ^2 _m +_N  f()_N  
_m +f()m^2_m =0.
Let us look at the Schrodinger equation for wave functions  
for a general profile  in the case . 
The Laplacian and gradient in  have both radial and angular
parts, so the solutions can be separated as 
, 
where  is the polar angle in the transverse plane.
The scalar "graviton" couples to matter located on the string-like brane 
.  We assume, as explained in the previous section, 
that only the radial KK modes
(no angular dependence) of our scalar field 
couple to matter density localized on the soliton .
If we substitute

subs 
_m ()1 f()  _m (),
we obtain a Schrodinger equation for modes 

s2 
-^" _m +(1 2 f" f +
1 2 f' f (1  -f' 2f )^2-
1 4^2 )_m =m^2_m .
The modes are orthogonal, and the normalization integrals are:

orth 
f()_n _m dm _m,n ,f()_ _n _ _m d 
f()_n _m d =m^2.
The effective 4D action is: 


efac 
L =1 2 M_*^2+N 
_m ( _ _m ^ 
_m -m^2_m ^2 )+_m  _m (0) 
M_* ^2_m   _m T(x).
Here  is the convolution of the wave function  and the
matter profile 

convo2 
 _m (0)=d()_m ().
As in the previous section, this represents the coupling of KK graviton modes 
of mass  to brane-localized matter, and we can approximate their couplings 
to  be .


Let us illustrate the main properties of the smooth brane  model in  
transverse dimensions. Consider following profile:

delta 
F =(-^2/^2 ) / .
This profile, multiplied by  is a regularization of a
delta function in  dimensions. 
It is instructive to see what the spectrum is when one neglects the constant 
1 in Eq. (), and then treats the problem in some approximation. 
This is equivalent to taking 
the limit . Taking  one finds in Eq. () the
Schrodinger potential

sho 
V()=(1/)^2[(/)^2-1].
This is the potential of a simple harmonic oscillator with the spectrum 

spho 
m_n =2n /,n=0,2,4,...
Here  is an even integer, 
since the wave function and derivative at origin must
be continuous, and we restricted ourselves to modes with no angular dependence.
As a first approximation, we can say that the spectrum of the model in 
Eq. ()
consists of a tower of metastable modes with masses Eq. (). 
A metastable zero mode (with mass exactly zero in the 
 limit) will be responsible for the 
potential(In fact, in the case  this 
is an exact picture. The metastable mode of mass zero has a width 
, that results in the crossover distance 
 between four and five-dimensional gravity.) .
The Schrodinger potential resulting from the profile () reads

sh23 
V()=(1/)^2(2^2)-4[2^3(^2)+(-1+^2)] 4[+(^2)]^2 .
where  is given in units of the brane 
thickness . This potential is shown in Fig. 2. 
The tunneling rate 
represents the decay width of the resonance and can be calculated in the 
WKB approximation

decw 
_0 1  ( -2_y_1 ^y_2 V dy),
here  are the classical turning points. The width of the 
potential well is . 
For large values of , we are well within the limit of validity of
the WKB approximation, namely .  
The integral in Eq. () can be evaluated numerically. 
The dependence of the integral on  is (shown in a log-log plot in 
the insets in Fig. 2) .


file=F1A.eps,width=7cm  
Figure 2:  
Potential Eq. ()  (solid line) together with potential
Eq. () (dashed line).  is in units of , the potentials 
are in units of ,
while . The inset shows the log-log plot of  
integral in Eq. () vs. . 

Here, the difference from the expected result 
is due to the WKB approximation. Assuming that the width of zero mode is 
, and by
knowing that the zero mode is responsible for the 4D potential on the brane,
we can calculate the value of the "Newton" constant . 
The square of KK graviton coupling to matter ()
multiplied by the width of the zero mode resonance gives
the cumulative effect of tree level exchange of continuum KK modes in the 
resonance.
The effective 4D Newton constant is thus 
 for two choices of parameters: 1)
 and ; 2) 
, and .

Four dimensional interactions between masses on the brane are mediated by the 
exchange of the
zero mode resonance, of width .
The WKB approximation gives the value of Newton's constant, 
however it misses most of the
features of brane induced gravity in  transverse dimensions. 
In particular, it doesn't predict the transition between the four-dimensional 
and  the higher-dimensional regime and it does not give
the distance at which this transition happens (crossover distance). 
In the rest of this section, we will study the spectrum and the couplings
of KK modes in brane induced gravity. 
We will see that the graviton resonance has a finite mass, and that its width 
is not . However, the correct value of the Newton constant
is obtained by exchange of a massive graviton resonance.

The Schroedinger equation can be solved numerically, and its solution can be 
used to find the convolution of the KK wave functions with the wave function
of  localized matter. We will investigate the couplings of different
modes in order to determine how the transition between four dimensional gravity
and higher dimensional gravity occurs and what is the crossover distance. 

The suppression of the KK graviton couplings to brane matter is shown in 
Fig. 3. We notice the peak positioned
close to zero mass that is responsible for 4D gravity, as well as higher 
resonant modes at position of harmonic oscillator levels, 
with masses . Since we are interested
in the large distance behavior, we show a 
magnified picture of a graviton resonance in log-log scale. 
The behavior is as follows: for the mode of mass zero, the coupling is zero. 
Then, the coupling rises as
, with the peak positioned at 
. To the right of the peak, the 
coupling dies off as .


file=F3A.eps,width=9cm  
Figure 3:  Dependence of the coupling of a 
KK mode on its mass for . 
Peaks are at the location of resonant states of a harmonic oscillator with
.
In the inset, a peak is shown at , 
for  both in normal (left) and log-log (right) scale. 
The "graviton" resonance is asymmetrical. To the left of the peak,  
it grows as , giving rise
to a 6D potential at large distances, while to the right, it decays as 
. The solid lines have coefficients 0.5 and -1, respectively. 


We see that the graviton is a massive asymmetric resonance. 
The mass and the width of the resonance are

masg 
m_g 1   ,_m_g 1   .
Starting from zero mass, the resonance grows as 

gro 
_m (0)m .
Now we can choose two possible sets of values for 
 and  in order to
reproduce the correct 4D Newton constant 
; or 
. Both choices give,
for the crossover distance (inverse graviton mass) and the resonance width,

cros2 
r_c ^N=2 m_g ^-1 M_P M_* ^2 ,
_m_g M_* ^2 M_P  .
In the case of , the graviton mass is roughly the same as the resonance  
width.
On the brane, at distances , we can evaluate the "Newtonian" potential
 from the coupling  given in Eq. (), and the shape of the peak's
left ridge Eq. (). The exchange of modes with mass 
contributes weakly, so one can integrate from zero to infinity. 
The coupling of graviton KK modes
is proportional to , so the potential is given by:

6dpo 
V(r)_0 ^ m M_* ^4  
(-mr) r dm=1 M_* ^4 1 r^3 
,rM_P /M_* ^2.
This is just the 6D Newton's potential that appear at distances larger than 
the crossover distance.
At short distances, the exchange of a single massive-graviton resonance 
gives rise to the 4D Newton's potential: 

6dpoa 
V(r)1 M_P ^2 1 r ,rM_P /M_* ^2.
Here we approximated the area under the square of the curve determining the
coupling with twice the area on the left side of the peak.






The Spin 2 Case 
After having studied in details the scalar theory, we can proceed 
with a true gravitational theory. 
Although the scalar gravity example captures the main features of 
brane-induced gravity,
it is crucial to show that our regularization gives a consistent (4D) 
spin-2 theory.
In particular, we have to show that no tachyons
or ghosts propagate in our framework. 
In the effective 4D theory, the higher dimensional graviton is 
represented by  four dimensional spin two states and a set of scalars. 
We should check that the masses given to those fields are not
negative, and that the (massive) graviton propagates with the right number 
of degrees of freedom, which is assured if the mass term is of the 
Pauli-Fierz form. 

The action to be considered is:

 

We can do an expansion in KK-modes for the gravitational field, 
analogous to the scalar case:

 
The boundary conditions now are the well-known 
Israel matching conditions , which give an equation for
the extrinsic curvature of the sphere which divides the 
-dimensional space into two parts:

 
These equations become particularly simple when we use 
Gaussian normal coordinates, since then
the extrinsic curvature is given by 
.
One sees that the boundary conditions for the KK modes are completely 
analogous to the scalar case
equations treated in the previous section. This reduces the spin 2 case
essentially to the spin 0 case. 
In the following  equations we split the -dimensional indices  into
4D indices: , and transverse indices: 
. The  are the fluctuations
of the metric around the flat background and 
 is the trace of the fluctuation. The Einstein 
tensor is denoted by .

We perform now a shift on :

After some algebra we get:

m5 
Now we make the gauge choice:

 
For  we get the following equation of motion for 
the four dimensional part of the metric:
 
We assume that the matter distribution is confined to the brane, so only 
the 4D part of the energy momentum tensor is nonzero. 
If we contract this equation with , we get, by conservation of
 the matter energy-momentum tensor, and thanks to the Bianchi identities:
 
This equation gives us a constraint on . Indeed, 
remembering that 
 applied to the fields gives their (nonzero) masses, we can conclude:
 
On the other hand, if we take the trace of Eq. (), we get 
 
This means that  is determined "algebraically" by T; 
. By algebraically, we mean that the equation 
for  is local in four dimensions.
Next, after a short calculation, 
the equations of motion for  become: 
 
where  is the field strength of the 4-dimensional vectors 
.
This equation describes  massive vector fields in four dimensions. 

We are left with the equations of motion of the  scalars . 
One obtains:
 
Observe that the divergence of  is identically zero by 
virtue of the gauge choice 
(As it should be, using global energy-momentum 
conservation and remembering that the energy momentum tensor has only 4D 
components.) . 

Using Eq. ()  we finally obtain:
 

Looking at equations () and  (), we see that all the mass 
terms have the correct form, with . In particular, the spin-2
mass terms have the Pauli-Fierz form. This is of course what we expect
in a generic Kaluza-Klein reduction . We can thus 
be sure that in our regularization, no ghost propagates. 

Conclusions 

In this paper we have proposed a well-defined regularization scheme for 
"brane-induced" gravity in codimension . At its simplest, the scheme
replaces an infinitely thin brane with a "dielectric" sphere of radius 
 in the transverse space. This regularization allows for a simple
analytic computation of the spectrum of massive resonances, and it accounts 
simply for the tensor structure of gravity. Unlike other regularizations
already existing in the literature, ours introduces neither ghosts nor 
tachyons. 
In this respect we must notice an important point. 
Our definition of the 4D graviton involves a shift [see Eq. ()], which
is the linearized version of a conformal rescaling. By doing this shift, we
couple the (scalar) internal components of the metric fluctuation to the trace
of the matter stress-energy tensor, even though it only has 4D components.
In other words, extra scalar, dilaton-like degrees of freedom couple to matter.
This is not a disaster per se , because even in their absence, linearized
massive gravity propagates an extra spin-zero degree of freedom .
Their presence only worsens the vDVZ discontinuity. 
In the regularization of ref. , instead, when the regularization
parameter is removed, one recovers massless  4D gravity. This is achieved
at the price of introducing light ghosts into the system.

We notice also that in codimension , no extra scalar propagate, as shown 
by Eq. ().

Finally, our "sharp" regularization can be easily extended to cover the case
of vector fields in  dimensions. The smooth version of our regularization
may also be realized in a physical setting by coupling  dimensional gravity to
a scalar field which admits a soliton solution (kink etc.)

In numerical study of section 3, we will take for simplicity 
that matter wavefunctions have profile of
the soliton and the coupling will turn out to be proportional to the 
wave functions of KK modes at the
origin of extra dimensions. Now we want to study the properties of this system for the
particular choice ()for the profile . 


In Fig.4 we show the plot of coupling () of KK graviton modes to the brane 
localized matter.
As expected, spectrum consist of a resonance with mass close to zero and higher resonances
that are located at the levels of harmonic oscillator. Since the brane scale is very high
(we take it here to be ), we need to look only at the graviton resonance.
Resonance is shown in insets to Fig.4, both in normal and log-log plot. Coupling of continuum
goes as follows. At the mass zero, coupling is zero, then coupling rises as 
. Peak is positioned at , and on the right of the peak
coupling fall off as .

Graviton resonance is asymmetrical. Left sides grows like  giving rise
to 7D law at large distances, while it decays like . Solid lines have coefficients

In codimension  4D 'graviton' is a very narrow resonance. The crossover
from 4D to 7D law doesn't happen because of graviton 'decay'. At large distances
4D 'graviton' simply becomes too heavy to contribute to the tree level exchange. 

At large distances  we evaluate the potential from the
coupling () and the coupling of light KK modes to brane matter ()

This is just the 7D potential that appear at distances larger than the crossover distance.

At short distances, Newtonian potential due to exchange of higher dimensional graviton
 between two masses is due to the exchange of graviton resonance.
Taking the square of the resonance height and multiplying it with the resonance width,
we recover the 4D Newton's law

A remarkable fact of DGP generalized to  is that they have a  crossover distance,
 , as argued with different techniques in, and. We can test what happens in the system that we are considering here. We
 would hope to discover this crossover distance for arbitrary higher dimension. For
 example, in  we get the following solution to equations , :
 
    
The continuity equation give:
  
As where the derivative equation provides:
 
The ratio of the two equations determines :
  
Again, we approximate the left-hand side of this equation in the region we are interested in to obtain:
  
which yields the condition for :
  
Substituting this in the continuity equation we can solve for A.
 
The wavefunction squared (now ) has a peak for
  (see fig.1), so we discover the same
 crossover distance as in codimension 3. The traces of a universal behavior
 are present, and analytically calculable in the theory presented.
