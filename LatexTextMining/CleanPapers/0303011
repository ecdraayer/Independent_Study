The role of quantum effects in brane-world cosmology is investigated. It is 
shown in time-independent formulation that quantum creation of deSitter branes 
in five-dimensional (A)dS bulk occurs with also account of brane quantum CFT 
contribution. The surface action is chosen to include cosmological constant 
and curvature term. (The time-dependent formulation of quantum-corrected brane 
FRW equations is shown to be convenient for comparison with Supernovae data).
The particles creation on deSitter brane is estimated and is shown to be
increased due to KK modes. The deSitter brane effective potential due to
bulk quantum matter on 5d AdS space is found. It may be used to get the
observable cosmological constant 
in the minimum of the potential (stabilization). The appearence of
the entropy bounds from bulk field equation is also mentioned.

Introduction 

In the brane-world scenario, our four-dimensional universe represents 
the brane (boundary) embedded into the higher dimensional space. Unlike 
to original Kaluza-Klein proposal, such picture may be quite consistent 
as it predicts that brane gravity is trapped on the brane 
even if extra dimensions are relatively large. Among the other positive 
aspects of brane-world scenario, one may count: the natural solution of 
hierarchy problem (where Planck scale appears) and the 
connection with the AdS/CFT 
correspondence (and, hence, with string theory). Moreover,
such scenario is successful manifestation of holographic principle.
It is also interesting, that bulk contributions (like dark radiation) to 
brane gravitational equations may be important only at very early universe
(at least, for a number of models). They play no role at the late epochs 
of the universe evolution (even at the remote past epoch with very high 
redshift observed in the case of supernovae Ia).  

Taking into account that brane-world should be the consequence (ground 
state?) of 
some quantum gravity which is not constructed yet as consistent theory, 
the study of quantum effects in such models are of great importance.
Indeed, quantum effects are expected to be important in the construction 
of non-singular and (or) stable brane-world cosmologies, in the resolution 
of the cosmological constant problem and in drawing more relations 
with string theory (AdS/CFT set-up). Moreover, such investigation may 
teach us the important lessons about the structure of the future quantum 
gravity. Unfortunately, even in semiclassical approximation it is not 
so easy to consider the quantum brane-world theory. Eventually, at 
first step one 
should investigate the particular aspects of quantum brane-world.
For example, the good starting point is quantum  matter theory on
the classical brane-world background. Even such approach turns out to
be too complicated and restrictive, as the very few, quite simple 
backgrounds (where one-loop calculations are possible to do) may be 
actually discussed. In such situation, one is forced to consider 
separetely the bulk and the brane quantum effects and estimate their 
role in various aspects of brane-world evolution. 

The purpose of this paper is to study the quantum (bulk and brane) 
matter effects and their influence to brane-world cosmology.
In the next section we start from the general five-dimensional action 
where four-dimensional brane action includes cosmological constant and 
curvature. With the correspondent choice of sign for bulk cosmological 
constant one may consider AdS or dS five-dimensional background.
Supposing that brane is constant curvature (deSitter or hyperbolic) space 
and working in time-independent 
setting, the quantum effects of conformal brane matter (via the conformal 
anomaly) are included into the brane gravitational equation. 
This is fourth-order algebraic equation which roots describe the quantum 
creation of deSitter or hyperbolic brane. Without brane curvature term 
and with the choice of brane cosmological constant as required by the 
cancellation of the leading divergence of AdS bulk, the equation simplifies 
and gives the inflationary deSitter brane (Brane New World) suggested 
some time ago in refs.. We also describe the connection
with the 
AdS/CFT correspondence (the specific choice of surface terms to
cancell the leading and next-to-leading divergence of AdS space).
The quantum creation of deSitter and hyperbolic branes and their stability 
in such a case depends on the content of brane matter.
In particulary, there is no creation when brane matter is  super 
Yang-Mills theory as required by AdS/CFT. Our formulation is quite simple 
and  general. Changing the sign of the bulk cosmological constant in the 
brane gravitational equation one arrives at the case with deSitter bulk.

In section three we consider another phenomenon related with the effect 
of brane gravity to quantum matter fields. The bulk scalar is seen as 
collection of massive scalars (Kaluza-Klein modes) on deSitter brane
which is embedded to AdS space. Gravitational field leads to particle 
creation which is summed over KK modes. As the result the total creation 
probability is significally increased if compare with the classical 
four-dimensional consideration. The created KK particles decay into
the light particles which indicates that particles creation
in the brane inflationary universe should be more intensive than usually 
expected.

In the fourth section we evaluate the  deSitter brane effective 
potential due to quantum bulk scalars and spinors in AdS bulk.
It is shown that it contains the minimum where it may be identified with 
the observable cosmological constant. Simple estimation indicates that
it may stabilize the present cosmological constant. Several remarks on
the relation of the field equation for AdS space with entropy of the 
correspondent AdS black hole are given in section five, using Verlinde 
formulation. 

Time-dependent formulation of quantum-corrected FRW brane equation 
is given in Discussion.




The creation of deSitter branes from (A)dS bulk with account of 
quantum effects  

In this section we will derive the equations of motion for deSitter (FRW)
brane when bulk is five-dimensional AdS or dS space.
It is supposed that there are conformal fields on the brane (for recent 
discussion of bulk conformal fields in brane-world scenario and list of 
relevant references, see 
).
These conformally invariant fields are quantum fields and their quantum 
effects (via the account of the correspondent brane conformal anomaly)
are included into the dynamical equation of motion. The number of 
solutions of brane gravitational equations describing the creation of 
deSitter (FRW) branes is presented. 

We follow the approach developed by 
 Shiromizu, Maeda and Sasaki where it has been shown how the 4d 
effective Einstein equation appears from the 5d bulk 
Einstein equation. In this section, we consider the case that the brane 
action contains the 4d scalar curvature with arbitrary coefficient 
(for its cosmological applications, see).

Let the 3-brane is embedded into the 5d bulk space as in.
Let  be the metric tensor of the bulk space and  be the unit vector 
normal to the 3-brane. Then the metric  induced on the brane has the 
following form: 
q_ =g_  - n_n_ .
The initial action is
S=d^5 x -g  1 _5^2  R^(5)  - 2+ 
+ S_brane (q) .
In this section,  the 5d quantities are denoted by the suffix  and 
4d ones by 
. In (),  expresses the matter fields contribution  
and  is the action on the brane, which will be specified later.  
The bulk Einstein equation is given by
1 _5^2 ( R^(5) _  - 1 2 g_  R^(5) )
= T_  
If one chooses the metric near the brane as:
ds^2 = d^2 + q_  dx^dx^ ,
the energy-momentum tensor  has the following form:
T_  = T_ ^bulk matter  - g_  
+ ()(-q_  + _ ) .
Here  is the energy-momentum tensor of the bulk matter, 
 is the bulk cosmological constant,  is the tension of the brane, 
and  expresses the contribution due to brane matter. 
Without the bulk matter (), 
 following the procedure in, the bulk Einstein equation can be mapped into 
the equation on the brane:
&& 1 _5^2  ( R^(4) _  - 1 2  q_ R^(4) ) && = - 1 2 ( + _5^2 ^2 6  ) q_  
+ _5^2 6 _  
+ _5^2_  - 1 _5^2 E_  .
Here  is given by
_ =-1 4 _ _^   + 1 12 _  
+ 1 8 q_ _  ^  - 1 24 q_ ^2 .
On the other hand,  is defined by the bulk Weyl tensor 
: 
E_ =C^(5) _ n^n^q_^   q_^   .
In general -dimensional spacetime, the Weyl tensor is 
C_ &=&R_  - 1 D-2  (g_ 
R_  - g_ R_  + g_  R_  - g_ 
R _ ) && + 1 (D-1)(D-2) R(g_ g_  - g_ 
g_ ) .
The brane action is taken as following
S_brane =-q (-R^(4) (q) - 2) .
 where the coefficient of brane curvature term is an arbitrary parameter.
It is not difficult to show that   () is 
given by the 4d Einstein tensor:
_ =( R^(4) _  - 1 2 q_  R^(4) ) .
Therefore one has
_  ^2  = - 1 4  R^(4) _  R^(4) _
+ 1 6 R^(4)  R^(4) _  + q_ (-1 16 R^(4)  ^2 
+ 1 8  R^(4) _  R^(4) ) .
Then Eq.() can be rewritten as
&& 1 _5^2  ( 1 - _5^4 6  ) 
( R^(4) _  - 1 2  q_ R^(4) ) && = - 1 2 ( + _5^2 ^2 6  )q_  && + ^2_5^2- 1 4  R^(4) _  R^(4) _
+ 1 6 R^(4)  R^(4) _  + q_ (-1 16 R^(4)  ^2 
+ 1 8  R^(4) _  R^(4) ) && - 1 _5^2 
C^(5) _ n^n^q_^   q_^   .
Note that one may identify the effective 4d gravitational constant 
 and 4d cosmological 
constant  with 
1 _4^2 
=6 _5^4  ( 1 - _5^4 6  )  ,
_4 = _5^2 2 ( + _5^2 ^2 6  )
( 1 - _5^4 6  )^-1   .
The next step is to include the quantum effects from the 
conformal brane matter. 
As usually, the simplest way to do so is to  consider the conformal 
anomaly(For recent discussion of conformal anomaly as applied to
brane black holes, see.) : 
^A=b(F^(4) +2 3 R^(4) ) + b' G^(4)  
+ b"R^(4)  ,
where 
is the square of 4d Weyl tensor,  is 
Gauss-Bonnet invariant, which are given as
F^(4) &=&1 3 R^(4)  ^2 -2 R^(4) _ij R^(4)ij 
+ R^(4) _ijkl R^(4)ijkl  G^(4) &=&R^(4)  ^2 -4 R^(4) _ij R^(4)ij 
+ R^(4) _ijkl R^(4)ijkl   ,
In general, with  scalar,  spinor,  vector 
fields,   ( or ) gravitons and  higher 
derivative conformal scalars, ,  and  are given by
&& b=N +6N_1/2 +12N_1 + 611 N_2 - 8N_HD  
120(4)^2 
&& b'=-N+11N_1/2 +62N_1 + 1411 N_2 -28 N_HD  
360(4)^2  , b"=0 .
For typical examples motivated by AdS/CFT correspondence 
one has:



a)   SYM theory 
b=-b'=N^2 -1 4(4)^2  ,

b)   theory 
b=12 N^2 + 18 N -2 24(4)^2  ,
b'=-12 N^2 + 12 N -1 24(4)^2  .
 Note that  is negative in the above cases. It is important to note
that even brane quantum gravity may be taken into account via the
contribution to correspondent parameters , .

Having in mind that observable universe was in past (or currently is) in 
deSitter phase,
the natural assumption is that brane is the Einstein manifold defined by
R^(4) _ =k L^2 q_   .
Here  is the length parameter and .
For positive  the brane universe is deSitter space (FRW  brane in 
Minkowski signature).
 Then 
R^(4) _  - 1 2 q_  R^(4)  = - k L^2  q_  .
Taking into account the energy-momentum tensor  caused by
the one-loop quantum effects,  () is 
modified as
_  = - k L^2  q_  + ^A_  .
Then   () has the following form: 
_ &=& - k^2^2 12 L^4 q_  + k6 L^2 ^A_  && -1 4 ^A_ _^A   + 1 12 ^A ^A_  
+ 1 8 q_ ^A_  ^A  - 1 24 q_ 
^A ^2 .
Then the brane equation corresponding () is given by
&& 0= k _5^2 L^2  ( 1 - _5^4 6  ) 
q_  - 1 2 ( + _5^2 ^2 6  )q_  
+ _5^2 6 ^A_  && - k^2^2_5^2 12 L^4 q_  
+ k_5^2 6 L^2 ^A_  && + _5^2( -1 4 ^A_ _^A   
+ 1 12 ^A ^A_  
+ 1 8 q_ ^A_  ^A  - 1 24 q_ 
^A ^2) && - 1 _5^2 
C^(5) _ n^n^q_^   q_^   .
It is quite general gravitational brane equation with account of brane 
quantum effects.

It is right time now to specify the structure of bulk space.
One can imagine that it is 5d AdS space, where
R^(5) _ = - 1 l^2 (g_  g_  - g_  
g_ ) .

Here
6 _5^2 l^2  .
Then 
C^(5) _ n^n^q_^   q_^  
=0 .
We can make an assumption on the brane structure stronger than ()
R^(4) _ =k 3L^2 (q_  q_  - q_  
q_ )  .
Then from Eq.(), one gets
^A=8k^2 3L^4  b' .
Furthermore, we assume  () is proportional to 
(Generally speaking, the situation is more
complicated here as quantum-corrected energy-momentum tensor depends also 
on the vacuum state chosen. However, as we actually use only trace of
brane
gravitational equation below, such choice turns out to be enough for our
purposes.) , which may be consistent with ():
 ^A_ =1 4 ^A q_ =2k^2 b' 3L^4  q_  .
Then Eq.() has the following form:
0&=& k _5^2 L^2  ( 1 - _5^4 6  ) 
 - 1 2 ( - 6 _5^2 l^2  + _5^2 ^2 6  ) 
+ _5^2 k^2 b' 9L^4  && - k^2^2_5^2 12 L^4  + k^3_5^2 9 L^6  
 - _5^2 k^4 b'^2 27 L^8  &=& ( 3 _5^2 l^2  - _5^2 ^2 12  )
+ ( 1 _5^2  - _5^2 6  ) k L^2  && + (_5^2 b' 9  - ^2_5^2 12   )
k^2 L^4  + k^3_5^2 9 L^6  
 - _5^2 k^4 b'^2 27 L^8    .
By solving the above equation,   may be determined.
In other words, the solution of above equation defines the creation of 
deSitter or hyperbolic branes with the account of quantum effects.
 In principle, there are four 
solutions of eq.() which should define created deSitter (or flat
or hyperbolic) branes and their relative stability.

When , the 4d brane universe can be regarded as deSitter spacetime 
and   can be identified with the ratio of the expansion. Let 
assume there are two 
solutions of Eq.(), one could be parametrized by the small  
and another one-by large one. At the 
early epoch, the universe might expand rapidly (the small  solution). 
At some time, 
there occurs a jump (transition) to large  solution caused by some 
(quantum or thermal) fluctuations. As a result, the 
present universe might expand slowly (large  solution). 

The interesting example is provided by the following choice
,k=3 ,6 l_5^2  ,
This means that  brane cosmological constant is 
predicted by AdS/CFT correspondence as the surface counterterm 
which is necessary in order to cancel the leading divergence of AdS space.



Eq.() has the following form:
(1 l  - _5^2 b' L^4 )^2 
= 1 L^2 (1 + L^2 l^2 )or 
1 L 1 + L^2 l^2  
-1 l  = - _5^2 b' L^4  ,
which (plus sign) reproduces the result (see also, 
). In other words,
we demonstrated that for the particular choice of the boundary terms, our 
equation describes the 
quantum creation of deSitter (inflationary) brane which glues two AdS 
spaces.
Such inflationary brane-world scenario is sometimes called Brane New 
World.


Let us define a new variable  by
X=k L^2  ,
Eq.() can be rewritten as 
0&=& ( 3 _5^2 l^2  - _5^2 ^2 12  )
+ ( 1 _5^2  - _5^2 6  ) X && + (_5^2 b' 9  - ^2_5^2 12   )X^2 
+ _5^2 9 X^3 - _5^2 b'^2 27 X^4   .
The equation () might be obtained from an effective potential
V(X)&=&-C( 3 _5^2 l^2  - _5^2 ^2 12  )X
+ ( 1 _5^2  - _5^2 6  ) X^2 2  
. && . + (_5^2 b' 9  - ^2_5^2 12   )
X^3 3  + _5^2 36 X^4 - _5^2 b'^2 135 X^5    .
Here  is a constant(
The effective potential whose stationary condition is given by () has, 
of course, some ambiguity but the potential () is sufficient when
we 
discuss the local stabibility.) . 
Especially in case of (), one gets
V(X)=-C X^2 2_5^2  + _5^2 b' X^3 27  
 - _5^2 b'^2 X^5 135     .
Since  
V'(X) = -CX _5^2 f(X) ,f(X)1 + _5^4 b' 54l X 
 - _5^2 b' ^2 27 X^3 ,
and 
f'(X)=_5^4 b' 54 l  - _5^4 b' ^2 X^2 9 <0 ,
 is monotonically decreasing function and  () has two extremal 
values with respect to , one is for  and another is for positive . The latter 
corresponds to the solution of (). As we know that the solution of () 
is stable, we should choose  in order that the corresponding solution could be 
stable. From the effective potential  (), one finds that the largest 
solution of () is stable but the smallest solution is unstable. Then if there are 
two solutions, one being positive and another being negative, the positive one is more 
stable than the negative one. Since positive (negative)  means  (), 
the spherical (deSitter) brane is more stable than the hyperbolic (anti-deSitter) brane. 

In case of the AdS/CFT correspondence, the surface 
terms (the parameters of the brane action) are derived  
6 _5^2 l  ,l _5^2  .
Furthermore in case of AdS/CFT correspondence, one uses
l^3 _5^2 =N^2 8^2  .
Using () and (), Eq.() is simplified:
0=(b' - N^2 64^2 )k^2 L^4  + l^2 k^3 6L^6  
 - 4^2 b' ^2 l^4 k^4 9N^2 L^8  .
Without the quantum correction, that is, with 
 , there are trivial (flat brane) solution  and 
non-trivial solution , which corrresponds 
to the brane of the sphere or deSitter space since . 
By including the quantum correction and using () in the large , 
Eq.() becomes
 
0= k^2 L^4 (- N^2 32^2  + l^2 k 6L^2  
 - N^2 l^4 k^2 9216^2 L^4 ) .
Since the quantity insides  is negative for the sufficiently large 
, there will be only trivial solution . 
In other words, when brane QFT is super Yang-Mills theory required 
by the duality with AdS space, there is no creation of dS brane.
For general , the nontrivial solutions of () are given by
k L^2 =9N^2 4^2 b' ^2 l^2 1 12   1 144  
+ (b' - N^2 64^2 )4^2 b' ^2 9N^2    .
In order that the solution () is real, the following condition 
should be satisfied,
4^2 9N^2  G(b')1 144  
+ (b' - N^2 64^2 )4^2 b' ^2 9N^2 0 .
The function  can be factored as
&& G(b')=(b' - x_0)(b' - x_+) (b' - x_+) ,&& x_0N^2 192^2 + _+ + _- ,x_+N^2 192^2 + _+ + _-^2  ,&& x_0N^2 192^2 + _+ ^2 + _- ,
^23 i =-1 2  + i3  2   ,&& _(N 8 )^2 3 
1 27 (N 8 )^4 - 1 2  . && . 1 2  ( 1 - 8 27 (N 8 )^4 )
( 1 + 4 27 (N 8 )^4 ) 
^1 3  .
If 
(N 8 )^4 > 27 8  ,
 is complex and  is the complex conjugate of
. 
In this case, all of  and  are real. If we reorder them and write 
as , ,  so that , in order that the solution 
() is 
real, one arrives at the condition
x_1b' x_2 ,or  b'x_3 .
On the other hand, if 
 
(N 8 )^4 < 27 8  ,
only  is real and  are complex. Then in order that the solution () is 
real,  the condition appears
b'x_0 .
Thus, we demonstrated that if brane matter is different from super YM
theory, there occurs quantum creation of deSitter brane.
Since for usual matter  is negative, two of the solutions in
() are positive, then the 
corresponding branes are deSitter. With  being small, Eq.() 
has the following form:
k L^2 9N^2 24^2 b' ^2 l^2  ,
3N^2 32^2 l^2  .
If  is  large, , which corresponds 
to the rate of the expansion of the universe, becomes very large.   
Here we assumed by () that the brane 
gravity vanishes but even if the brane gravity is non-trivial, the situation is 
not so changed at least if . 

We now consider the case that the bulk is not AdS but deSitter. This can be obtained 
by changing the sign of the bulk cosmological constant in () by 
. Furthermore as in, if
 the following situation is discussed 
6 _5^2 l  ,,b'=0 ,k=3
the equation corresponding to () looks as:
0= -6 _5^2 l^2  + 3 _5^2 L^2   .
Then the solution is 
L=l 2   ,
which reproduces the result in. (One can also search for 
deSitter branes in dS bulk using time-dependent setting.)
This solution describes the classical creation of deSitter brane from
deSitter bulk. With  defined as in (), the 
effective potential corresponding to () is
V(X)=C( 6 _5^2 l^2 X - 1 2_5^2  X^2 )  .
With  as in (), the solution () becomes instable. 

One may consider the case with quantum corrections as in () and
() but with  being arbitrary. 
The  equation analogous to () is given by
0= - 6 _5^2 l^2  
+ (2 b' 3l  - N^2 96 ^2 l  )k^2 L^4  
+ k^3 l 9 L^6  - 8^4 k^4 l^3 b' ^2 27 N^2 L^8   ,
and  introducing  (), the effective potential is given by 
V(X)=-C - 6 _5^2 l^2  X
+ (2 b' 3l  - N^2 96 ^2 l  )X^3 3  
+ l 36 X^4 - 8^2 l^3 b' ^2 135 N^2 X^5   ,

Eq.() has maximally four solutions. 
First, Eq.() does not have flat solution . 
Since 
V"(X)=-CX  2(2 b' 3l  - N^2 96 ^2 l  ) 
+ l 3 X - 32^2 l^3 b' ^2 27 N^2 X^2   ,
the equation  has three solutions
X=0 ,X=X_(3N 8 l b' )^2 
(3N 8 l b' )^4 + 27N^2 4^2 l^4 b' ^4 
(2b' 3  - N^2 96^2 )  .
For large ,  behaves as . 
Since , if  or , there 
is non-trivial solution in (). If , we have  and all the 
solutions in () express dS (not AdS) brane. Thus, the succesful demonstration
of dS brane creation from dS bulk is also made. 

Particles creation on the dS brane 

In the present section the role of the brane quantum effects to bulk 
matter is described. Specifically, we consider bulk scalar which appears 
on the brane
as collection of massive scalars (KK modes). As in previous section, the 
brane is supposed to be deSitter one. Then, brane gravitational field 
leads to particles creation effect which should be summed over the KK 
modes.

We start from the following expression of the metric of the Euclidean five-dimensional 
anti-deSitter space (AdS):
ds^2 = dy^2 + l^2^2 y l ( d^2 + ^2 d_3^2).
Here  is the metric of the three-dimensional sphere (S) with 
unit radius. Let assume that there is a brane at  and the 
region of the bulk space is given by . Then the brane is a 
four dimensional sphere (S) with the radius . 
We now Wick-rotate the coordinate  by . 
The following metric is obtained
ds^2 = _,g_  dx^dx^
= dy^2 + ^2 y l  ( - dt^2 + ^2 t d_3^2).
Then the brane becomes four-dimensional deSitter (dS) space, whose rate 
of the expansion is . If we define a new time coordinate  
by ,  expresses the
cosmological time on the brane. 

The  Klein-Gordon equation for the scalar field  
with mass  looks as:
0 &=& -1 -g  _(-g g^ _) 
+ M_5^2 &=& -1 ^4 y l  _y ( ^4 y l  _y ) 
 - 1 l^2 ^2 y l  _4 + M_5^2  , 

_4 &=& - 1 ^3 t  _t (^3 t _t 
) + 1 ^2 t _3 .
Here  is the Laplacian on S with unit radius. Then 
 is the Laplacian  on dS with unit length 
parameter. The eigen-functions and eigen-values of  are
known:
_3 Y_klm  = - k(k+2) Y_klm  .
Here , , and . 
Then the the eigen-functions of  are given 
by:
_klm ^()  &=& Y_klm  ^k t ^(-k - 3 2 i)t  F(k+3 2 , k+3 2 i, 1 i
; -^-2t )  ,
_klm() ^&=& Y_klm  ^k t ^(k + 3 2 i)t  F(k+3 2 , k+3 2 i, 1 i
; -^2t )  ,
_4 &=& - M_4^2  ,= _klm ^() , 
_klm() ^ ,&=&  M_4^2 - 9 2   .
Here  is Gauss' hypergeometric functions.  can be identified with the mass of the 
Kaluza-Klein modes. 
When , one gets
^()  ^(-3 2 i)t  .
On the other hand, when  the asymptotics looks as
_() ^^(3 2 i)t  .
Then  () corresponds to the positive (negative) 
frequency mode at . On the other hand,   
() corresponds to the positive (negative) frequency mode at . 
In the 5d Klein-Gordon equation, by assuming 
_klm ^()M_5 =^M_5 (y)_klm ^()  ,

or 
_klm() ^M_5 = ^M_5 (y) _klm() ^ ,

we obtain 
0= - l^2 ^4 y l  _y(^4 y l  
_y ^M_5 )   
 - M_4^2 ^2 y ^M_5  + M_5^2 l^2 ^M_5  .
Replacing 
z=^2 y l  ,^M_5 =z^^M_5  (z) ,

1 + 1 + M_4^2  2  ,
one gets
0=z(1-z)d^2 dz^2  +(2+ 5 2 ) 
 - (2+ 3)zddz  - 
(M_4^2 4  - M_5^2 l^2) .
 Assuming that the scalar field is not singular in the 
bulk ( or ), the
solution of
() is given by Gauss' hypergeometric function:
&& ^M_5 = z^-(+ 1 3+ M_5^2 l^2 +1 )  && F(+ 1 3+ M_5^2 l^2 +1 , -- 1 2  
3+ M_5^2 l^2 +1 , 1 2  ; z-1 z ) && =(y l )^-(+ 1 3+ M_5^2 l^2 +1 )  

&& F(+ 1 3+ M_5^2 l^2 +1 , -- 1 2  
3+ M_5^2 l^2 +1 , 1 2  ; ^2 y l )  .
Now  can be regarded as 
the mass of the Kaluza-Klein 
modes. Imposing some boundary condition to the scalar field  on the 
brane, the Kaluza-Klein modes  take the discrete values. 
It is technically very difficult to find the exact values of the Kaluza-Klein modes.
Imagine the situation when   is large. Then 
from (), one finds that  is large:
M_4 2  .
Then we can approximate  in () as follows,
^M_5 (y) && (y l )^-  
F(, -, 1 2 ; 
^2 y l ) &=& ^(2) .
Here  a new coordinate  is introduced
= y l  , 0< 2  .
By using (), one finds 
^M_5  ^-  (2) .
Then  imposing the Neumann-type boundary condition 
 () 
or Dirichlet-type boundary condition 
 (), the Kaluza-Klein masses 
 take the discrete values:
M_KK ^22l y_0 l   
nl _0 y_0 l   
= n_0 l _0    .
Here  is a large integer and   corresponds to , where the 
brane exists. 

We can now expand  by  or :
&=& _,k,l,m (a_klm ^M_5 _klm ^(+)M_5 
 + a_klm ^M_5  ^_klm ^(-)M_5 ) &=& _,k,l,m (b_klm ^M_5 _klm(+) ^M_5 
 + b_klm ^M_5  ^_klm(-) ^M_5 )  .
The creation operators  and  
and/or annihilation operators  and  are related 
by the unitary transformation as in:  
 
a_klm ^M_5  ^&=& ^k  b_klm ^M_5  ^
 - ^k  b_klm ^M_5   ,a_klm ^M_5  &=& - ^k  ^* b_klm ^M_5  ^
+ ^k  ^* b_klm ^M_5   ,^k  &=& i(-)^k i(-)^k   ^k  &=& ^-2i_k  
(1-i) (-i) (k+3 2  -i)
(-k - 1 2  -i)  .
Then the creation probability  per unit volume and unit time for the particle modes 
with  is, as in (for earlier discussion, see), 
given by
= 8 ^2 l^4 ^4 y_0 l   .
For the Kaluza-Klein modes with large mass (large ), from (), 
 is large:
M_4 .
Then the creation probability of the Kaluza-Klein modes with large mass 
is exponentially suppressed:
16^-2M_4  ^2 l^4 ^4 y_0 l   .
The result  () or () is valid if the masses 
of the Kaluza-Klein modes are smaller than the Planck mass scale. If not,
 one 
cannot neglect the backreaction due to particles creation. Probably,then 
one should consider quantum gravity effects. Now we have considered 
the case that  
is large but this does not always mean that the real masses of the Kaluza-Klein modes 
are large. The real masses of the Kaluza-Klein modes are given by 
. The length parameter  of 
the bulk AdS space 
could be of the order of the Planck length. If 
, that is, the radius 
or the length parameter of the dS brane is large, one may neglect the
backreaction to 
the gravity and Eqs.() and () are valid. Since for
large 
 in () 
M_4 n _0  
by using (), we can sum up the Kaluza-Klein modes to obtain the total creation 
probability:
_total  = _KK modes  
_n 16^-2 ^2  n   ^2 l^4 ^4 y_0 l  
16 ^2 l^4 ^4 y_0 l  C 1 - ^-2 ^2     .
The coefficient  could be determined by the contribution from the Kaluza-Klein 
modes with relatively small masses. Eventually,  is the order of
the unity. 
Eq.() shows that the creation of the Kaluza-Klein modes could
not 
be neglected in the inflationary universe. The created Kaluza-Klein particles 
 decay into the light particles although the decay rate etc.  depend on 
the details of the interactions of the bulk scalar  with the light particles. 
Then,  the particle creation at the early Universe with orbifolded extra
dimensions should be much larger than that
expected from 
the naive Standard Model. 






Stabilization of the brane cosmological constant 

It would be of great interest to consider the role of both: brane and bulk 
quantum effects to brane-world cosmology.
Unfortunately, technically it is not so easy to make such a study.
Hence, one should discuss the role of such effects separately.
In this section the quantum bulk scalar is considered and its contribution
to brane effective potential is found. This may suggest the mechanism to
stabilize the induced brane cosmological constant.


We start with the action for a conformally invariant
massless scalar 
S  = 12 d^5 x g 
[ -g^ _  _  +
_5 R^(5)  ^2 ]  ,
where ,  being the five-dimensional scalar curvature.

Let us recall the expression for the Euclidean metric of the
five-dimensional AdS bulk:
ds^2 &=& g_ dx^ dx^ 
=l^2 ^2 z  ( dz^2 + d_4 ^2 ),

d_4 ^2 &=& d^2 + ^2 d_3^2  ,
where  is the AdS radius which is related to the cosmological constant 
 of the AdS bulk by , and  
is the metric on the 3-sphere. Two dS branes, 
which are four-dimensional spheres, are placed in the AdS background.
If we put one brane at , which is fixed, and the other brane at , 
the distance between the branes is given by .  


The action, Eq. (), is conformally invariant under
the conformal transformations for the metric Eq. () and
the scalar field, which are given by
g_  = ^-2  z l^2  g _  , 
= ^3/2  z  l^-3/2    .
The corresponding transformed Lagrangian looks like
L =( _z ^2 +^(4)  +_5 R^(4) 
) .
where .  This Lagrangian was used in ref. in
order to calculate the Casimir effect (for related study of bulk Casimir 
effect in brane-world with applications to radion stabilization,
see).
We apply the result of this
calculation in the study of brane cosmological constant induced by
bulk  quantum effects.

As shown in Ref., the one-loop effective potential can be 
written as 
V=12L V_4 (L_5/ ^2)  ,
where  
and  is the volume of the four dimensional sphere with a unit 
radius. The explicit calculation gives: 
- (L_5/ ^2) &=& (0L_5) &=& (-4) 6 ^4  L^4  +
 (-2) 12  ^2 L^2  &&   
 &&  
0.129652 L^4  - 0.025039 L^2   + The expression of the zeta-function has been given in terms of an expansion 
on the brane distance , valid for , which complements the one 
for large brane distance obtained above. In (), since  is 
dimensionless,  is dimensionless. 



Since the effective potential () is evaluated in the conformally 
transformed metric (), the Casimir energy density  
in the real space is given by
_0 = ^5 z l^5 V
=-^5 z 2l^5 L V_4 (0L_5)  .
Then the effective potential  per unit volume on the brane 
at  is given by
V_eff  = ^4 z_1 l^4 V_4 _z_2 ^z_1  dz d_4 
l^5 ^5 z  _0 
= -1 2 V_4 R_1^4 (0L_5)  .
Here  is the radius of the brane at . 
Then when we Wick-rotate the metric into the Minkowski signature, the rate 
of the expansion of the universe, that is the Hubble parameter, is given 
by . In the leading order  one has
V_eff  -1 2 V_4 R_1^4 ((-4) 6 
^4 L^4   + (-2) 12  ^2 L^2  
) .
As we will see later, the higher order terms do not contribute for 
 large brane. 
We should also note that there can appear the (surface) terms  
corresponding to the tensions or classical  cosmological constants of
the branes. (This may be also considered as finite renormalization).
The brane at  gives a constant term. 
Since the radius  of the brane at  is given 
by , the 
ratio of the scales on the two branes is given by . 
Then the tension of the brane at  gives 
a term proportional to  
as the contribution into the 
effective potential. The total effective potential is given by
V_eff  = -1 2 V_4 R_1^4 (0L_5) 
+ _1 + _2 ( R_2 R_1 )^4 .
This is the quantity which should be identified with observable
cosmological constant including bulk quantum effects.

Note that the scalar curvatures on the branes are given 
by  and . 
Let assume , then  and therefore , 
which gives
R_2 R_1 =z_1 (L + z_1)  .
As   is assumed to be small, the effective potential () 
has the following form:
V_eff  && -1 2 V_4 R_1^4 ((-4) 6 
^4 L^4  +  (-2) 12  ^2 L^2  
+ ) && + _1 + _2(1 - L z_1
)^4 && -1 2 V_4 R_1^4 ((-4) 6 
^4 L^4  +  (-2) 12  ^2 L^2  
+ ) && + _1 + _2 - 4_2 L R_1^2 + l^2  R_1   .
We should note that the "distance"  is not the real distance between 
the two branes. From (), one can find the real distance  
is given by
L_R=_z_1 ^z^2  dz l z = 2l z_2 2  
z_1 2   .
In the limit where the radii  and  of the two branes become
very large, 
which is the limit of flat branes, we have . 
Then in the limit, Eq.() reduces as
L_R 2l z_2 z_1  .
Since
&& L=z_2 -z_1 (^L_R 2l  - 1 ) z_1 ,R_1 = l z_1  l z_1  ,&& R_2 R_1  = z_1 z_2  ^-L_R 2l   
Eq.() has the following form: 
V_eff  -1 2 V_4 l^4 (-4) 6 
^4 (^L_R 2l  - 1 )^4   + _1 
+ _2 ^2L_R l  ,
which coincides with the result in where it was used 
to study the radion stabilization. 
Note that 
the higher order terms in the expansion () vanish in the 
limit of the large brane.
Since  corresponds to the Hubble parameter when we 
Wick-rotate the metric into the Lorentzian signature, the large 
 corresponds to the slow expansion of the universe. In such a 
case, () is valid. 
Since  gives the ratio of the scales between the 
two branes, Eq.() shows that the hierarchy is given 
by  for the small Hubble parameter case. 


We now consider the case that  and  are small, that is, the Hubble 
parameter is large. In this case,  and  becomes large. 
Since  when , the distance 
 () has the following form:
L_R = 2l  1 + 2 ^-2z_1 ( 1 - ^-2L ) .
We should note that there is a minimum  in . In the limit that 
 and  go to infinity, . By using Eq.(), 
one finds
R_2 R_1 ^-L  .
Therefore if , the hierarchy between the weak scale and 
the gravity can be consistent with the present hierarchy. 

The value of the parameter  is defined by the minimum of the effective 
potential   () with respect to .  
Assuming that  is small, one may keep only the first term 
and neglect the other terms in  of ().
 Since we did  not specify the value of , we cannot drop 
the last term. Then from the variation of  with respect to , 
one finds that the minimum is given when
L^5^4 12 _2 V_4 R_1^3 R_1^2 + l^2   .
Since ,  should be positive in order that  is  
 positive.  
Then if  is not large, in order that  is small, from the consistency, 
 must be large. An interesting point is that the parameter  
should depend on  or the Hubble parameter . When  
is large, Eq.() and () show
L_R 2l 1 + LR_1 l  .
Since for large ,  and therefore 
the hierarchy slowly depend on the : . 

At the minimum (), the effective potential () has 
the following value
V_eff =_1 + _2 1 - R_1^2 + l^2  R_1 
(^4 12 _2 V_4 R_1^3 R_1^2 + l^2  
)^1 5  .
Thus, even if  is large, we can fine-tune  to make 
 be the value of the observable brane cosmological constant. 
Note, however, the minimum  () is unstable, which can 
be found from the fact that the effective potential () is unbounded 
below for small  since . Since the sign of the leading term in 
the contribution to  from the spinors is different from the one of the scalar 
fields,  the stability of the effective potential depends on the field content. 
With  scalars and  spinors, the effective potential () 
looks like
V_eff  = -N-M 2 V_4 R_1^4 (0L_5) 
+ _1 + _2 ( R_2 R_1 )^4 .
Then with small , the minimum of the effective potential 
is given, instead of () by
L^5(N-M)^4 12 _2 V_4 R_1^3 R_1^2 + l^2   .
If the contribution from the spinor fields is dominant, that is 
and 
also if , there exists a mimimum. In case ,  
the effective potential becomes stable at least for small . 
At the minimum, the effective potential has the following value.
V_eff =_1 + _2 1 - R_1^2 + l^2  R_1 
(^4 (N-M)12 _2 V_4 R_1^3 R_1^2 + l^2  
)^1 5  .
In the present universe, the Hubble parameter  could be 
 
(for a recent review of early Universe with positive cosmological
constant, see). 
We may identify  with  
( is the light velocity). On the other hand, the length parameter  could 
be a Planck length m, which is much smaller than . We may 
also identify  ( is the four dimensional 
gravitational coupling constant) with  
( is the cosmological constant). Then Eq.() may give 
10^-120  _4^4 _1 + _4^4 _2  1 - 10^-49 
(-_4^4_2)^-1 5   .
If one assumes ,
the second 
term (bulk quantum effects) in  of () can be
neglected. 
If , we have 
 or 
. 
On the other hand, Eq.() gives 
 then even if  
or ,  is small. Then
the hierarchy is hard to explain in the same way
 as in, without more fine-tuning  
and . Another possibility is to choose  so that the terms inside 
 in () cancelled with each other. Then  
, . In this case, 
as , there 
is a possibility to solve the problem of the hierarchy between the weak scale and 
Planck scale. 

As  could be large, one may assume  is also large. Then we may
use the 
effective potential (), modified by including  scalars and  spinors: 
V_eff  -(N-M)^4 2 V_4 l^4 (-4) 6 ^-2L_R l   
+ _1 + _2 ^2L_R l  ,
Here it is taken  since 
corresponds to the 
ratio of the weak scale and Planck scale (). 
For  and , the effective potential () has a 
minimum at
^4L_R l  = -(N-M)^4 2 V_4 l^4  (-4) 6 _2  ,
and the value of the effective potential at the minimum is given by 
V_eff  -(N-M)^4 (-4)_2 3 V_4 l^4    + _1 .
Taking  
and , one has  and 
, which is still much larger than .
Thus, the observable cosmological constant is induced by the only bulk
quantum effects but the natural solution of hierarchy problem does not
occur. 
On the other hand, if we require , we have 
 and 
. 
Then if , one may fine-tune 
for 
 to vanish.  

Thus, we demonstrated that the effective potential may be stable at the
minimum
where it coincides with the observable value of the 4d cosmological
constant. The quantum bulk effects (of spinors) stabilize the
effective potential which minimum defines the cosmological constant.
However, the fine-tuning of brane tension is still
necessary to recover the observable value of the brane cosmological
constant. Moreover, if necessary cosmological constant is induced it is 
hard to get the natural solution for hierarchy.

Field equation as entropy bound 

Let us make now several remarks on the form of field equation with 
(or without) quantum corrections.

If we write the metric () in the warped form
ds^2 = dy^2 + l^2 ^2A(y) d_4 ^2  ,
the Einstein equation has the following form: 
4A" + 4(A')^2 &=& 4 l^2  + ^2( -1 3 T 
+ T_yy ) 

A" + 4(A')^2 + 3 l^2 ^-2A 
&=& 4 l^2  - ^2( 1 12 T + 1 4 T_yy )  .
Here  is the trace of the energy momentum tensor .
In () and (),  the derivative with respect to 
 is denoted by  (). 
Combining () and (), one obtains
(A')^2 = - ^2 6 T_yy  - ^-2A  l^2  
+ 1 l^2  .
This has the form very similar to the FRW equation. 
One may identify  with the Casimir energy density   
(). On the branes, from the matching condition, we have
A'=_1,2  12  .
Here  is the tension of the brane. Combining 
() and (), one gets
_1,2  12 
=^2 6 ^5 z_1,2  2l^5 L V_4 (0L_5)
- z_1,2  l^2  
+ 1 l^2  .
It is very interesting that one can develop FRW-like interpretation 
of above field equation via corresponding entropy bounds.
As in, one defines the "Hubble entropy" , the 
"Bekenstein-Hawking entropy" , "Bekenstein entropy"  by
&& S_H 4l^5 ^2  A' V_4 ^4A  ,
S_BH  4l^4 ^2   V_4 ^3A  ,&& S_B  - 2l^6 V_4 ^5A (T_yy  6  - 1 
^2l^2  )  .
 Then above field equation
is rewritten as 
S_H^2 = 2S_B S_BH  - S_BH ^2 .
For the pure AdS case () 
A= y l   . 
If the hypersurface with  is considered as a horizon, 
 gives the usual Bekenstein-Hawking entropy since :
S_H 4A^_4 ^2  ,
A^_4 l^4 V_4 ^4A  .
On the other hand,  and  correspond to the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy when  the hypersurface with  is regarded as a horizon: 
S_BH , 2S_B 4A^0_4 ^2  ,A^0_4l^4 V_4 .
Eq.() may be rewritten as
S_H^2 + (S_B - S_BH )^2 = S_B^2  .
Remarkably, the entropy bounds a la Verlinde follow  
S_H ,S_B - S_BH  S_B .
Thus, it is demonstrated the universality of Verlinde representation 
for field equation. In similar way, other spaces may be discussed.
Even for pure AdS, one can impose the periodic boundary condition for 
the Euclidean time coordinate and introduce the temperature. Then we 
may consider the entropy, or other thermodynamical quantities even for 
the pure AdS case. The corresponding entropy is related with that of
the dual CFT as in. 

Discussion 

In summary, the role of bulk and brane quantum effects in brane-world cosmology
is considered. In particulary, the quantum creation of dS branes from
constant curvature five-dimensional bulk is discussed,
the way to stabilize the observable cosmological constant due to
bulk quantum effects is suggested. 

It is interesting that some modification of our formulation 
may be done so that the possibility to compare with fitting coming
from Supernovae observations appears.
Indeed, let the metric of the 3-brane has the warped form:
ds^2= - dt^2 + L^2^2A _i,j=1 ^3g_ij dx^i dx^j .
Here  is the metric which satisfies 
 with the Ricci curvature  
given by  and  is chosen.
The energy density  and pressure  may be defined by 
_tt  = ,_ij  =p g_ij  
= p^2A g_ij  (i,j=1,2,3) ,
Then  in () has the following form: 
_tt =1 12 ^2 ,_ij =(1 4 p + 1 12 ^2
)^2A g_ij  .
Especially, the contributions from the conformal anomaly are;
_A&=&-.1 a^4 [b'( 6 a^4 H^4 
+ 12 a^2 H^2) 

&&+ (2 3 b + b") a^4 ( -6 H H_,tt - 18 H^2 H_,t  
+ 3 H_,t ^2 ) + 6a^2 H^2&&  -2b +6 b' -3b" ] ,p_A&=&b' 6 H^4 + 8H^2 H_,t  + 1 a^2 ( 
4H^2 + 8 H_,t )  && .+ (2 3 b + b") -2H_,ttt  -12 
H H_,tt  - 18 H^2 H_,t  - 9 H_,t ^2 && . + 1 a^2 
( 2H^2 + 4H_,t )  -  -2b +6 b' -3b"3a^4   .
Here, the "radius" of the universe  and the Hubble parameter  are
aL^A ,H=1 a d a dt 
=d A dt  .
Since the 4d curvature has the following forms: 
R^(4) _tt = -3 H_,t  -3 H^2 ,R^(4) _ij =(-H_,t  - 3 H^2 + k a^2 )a^2g_ij  ,
if we choose the action on the brane as () with matter, 
the  component of Eq.() has the FRW like form 
H^2 &=& - k 2a^2  - _4 3  
+ _4^2[1 3 _matter  . && . + 2  -(3 H^2 
+ 3k 2a^2 ) 
+ _matter  + _A^2 - 6 _5^4 E_tt ] .
Here the 4d effective gravitational coupling constant and 
the cosmological constant are given in (). 

The last term including  becomes non-trivial if there is a black hole in the 5d bulk. 
The term is called dark radiation(For recent review of FRW cosmology from AdS bulk 
black holes, see. It is interesting that bulk AdS black 
hole may help to prevent QG era of FRW cosmology, for recent discussion, see.) 
and we may assume as in 
- 6_4^2 _5^4 E_tt  = C a^4  ,
with a constant . For the late universe, the matter can be regarded as a dust then 
_matter =_0 a^3  .
Furthermore if we neglect the term including the derivative of the Hubble parameter , 
the contribution () from the conformal anomaly has the following form
_A&&-6b'H^4 - (16b + b")H^2 a^2 
 -  -2b +6 b' -3b" a^4  .
Then Eq.() can be rewritten as
H^2&=& -_4 3  + 2 _4^2  (3H^2 + 6b' H^4)^2 && +  - k 2  + 2_4^2 (3H^2 + 6b' H^4) 
 2(16b + b") H^2 + 3k   
 1 a^2  && +  1 3  - 4(3H^2 + 6b' H^4)  
_4^2 _0 a^3  && +  C + _4^2  2(16b + b") H^2 + 3k^2 
2   . && . + 4 (3H^2 + 6b' H^4) (-2b +6 b' -3b" )  
1 a^4  && - 2_4^2  2(16b + b") H^2 + 3k _0

+ 2 (-2b +6 b' -3b" )^2  1 a^8  .
In order to compare the above expression with the  Supernovae data, as in last reference 
from, 
we rewrite () in the following form:
H^2(z)&=& H_0^2[_0^0 + _2^0 (1+z)^2

Here  is a redshift factop and  is the length parameter 
in the present universe. In (), the quantities in the present universe are 
expressed by the superscript "0".
It follows that parameters receive the quantum correction from the conformal 
anomaly. As quantum correction may be chosen to be non-dominant,
  the number of parameters choice to fit the Supernovae data exists.
