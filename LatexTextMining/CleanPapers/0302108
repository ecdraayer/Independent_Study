This paper deals with magnetic equations of the type  where the current
 is a -function on a brane worldvolume and  a -form
field strength. In many situations in -theory this equation
needs to be solved for  in terms of a potential. A standard universality
class of solutions,
involving Dirac-branes, gives rise to strong intermediate singularities in
 which in many physically relevant cases lead to inconsistencies. In this
paper we present an alternative universality class of solutions for magnetic
equations in
terms of Chern-kernels, and provide relevant applications, among
which the anomaly-free effective action for open -branes ending on
-branes.
The unobservability of the Dirac-brane requires a Dirac
quantization condition; we show that the requirement of "unobservability"
of the Chern-kernel leads in -theory to classical gravitational
anomalies which cancel precisely their quantum counterparts.

Introduction and Summary 

Extended objects represent basic excitations of -theory and string
theory; usually they show up in pairs of a brane with electric charge 
and a dual brane with magnetic charge ; the consistency condition for
their coexistence is represented by Dirac's quantization condition
   eg=2n G,
 where  is Newton's constant and  is an integer. In terms of
the charges the tensions are given by
 T_e=e/G,T_g=g/G.
 The distinction between branes and dual branes is to a certain
extent conventional, we call here (electric) "branes" the lower
dimensional objects and (magnetic) "dual branes" the higher
dimensional ones. The distinction becomes indeed physical when one
considers the couple of classical Maxwell equations arising from
supergravity theories with electric and magnetic sources: the
electric equation for a "brane"-source gets non-linear
corrections, while in most cases the magnetic one for a "dual
brane"-source does not and remains of the form
 dH=gJ_g,
 where  is the -function on the dual brane worldvolume
 and  is the
field strength curvature form. In the absence of non-linear corrections the
electric Maxwell equation is
 d*H=eJ_e,
 where  is the -function on the brane worldvolume .
This system of equations
is classically consistent if both brane worldvolumes are closed, i.e. 
. If one of the two branes is absent, say the magnetic one, then it is
also
straightforward to write an action because mag  can be solved locally
in terms of a potential through , but if both branes are present
then the introduction of a potential is more subtle. In this case a standard
device to solve the magnetic equation in terms of a potential requires the
introduction of a
Dirac-brane, i.e. a surface whose boundary is , and one can
write an action which is well defined modulo  if Dirac  holds.
In this case the potential  carries necessarily a singularity along
the Dirac-brane, and therefore also on  which is its boundary.
For linear Maxwell equations with sources one can clearly invert the role of
branes and dual branes, upon replacing  and introducing a
dual potential  instead of .

The present paper deals with situations where the r.h.s. of ele  carries
non-linear corrections which typically arise in supergravity theories coupled
to branes. Examples are - and -branes in eleven dimensions,
-branes and -strings in ten dimensions, and -branes in type
 theories. First of all, due to these corrections, in this case it is not
possible to introduce a dual potential  without  introducing
a potential ; this means that to write an action one must necessarily 
solve mag  in terms of . Once this has been done one can regard
the non-linear version of ele  as equation of motion and try to write
an action for this equation (so eventually there is no need to introduce
).

Since the magnetic equation remained the same as in the linear
case a natural attempt to solve it would be again through the
introduction of a Dirac-brane. To see if such a procedure works
we have to take a closer look on the nature of the non-linear
corrections to the r.h.s. of ele . In all the examples
quoted above these corrections contain terms of the kind 
  BJ_gor  J_g, 
 for some
target space form , not involving  (Clearly the
term  can not appear alone in the equation of motion since
it would spoil gauge invariance under . A
complete invariant equation of motion will be given in section
five.) . In the first term the potential  gets evaluated
directly on ; on the other hand, to get a term like 
 in the equation of motion one has to add to the action a term
like , and this requires again to
evaluate  on . But, as observed above, in the presence of
a Dirac-brane  is singular on  and hence its restriction
to (pullback on)  is not defined. We conclude that
whenever the dynamics of a theory involves a potential solving
mag  evaluated on the dual brane worldvolume 
itself  one has to abandon the Dirac-brane approach for that
brane. This seems a dangerous conclusion because the quantization
condition Dirac  is intimately related with the use of
Dirac-branes.

The main result of this paper is that a way out is provided by
Chern-kernels: these are differential forms , satisfying
, generalizing the Coulomb electric field.
The fundamental problem with Dirac-branes is
that they introduce -like singularities along their worldvolume;
the forms  instead exhibit milder universal inverse-power-like
singularities on  , and they allow to define potentials  which are
well-defined on . They constitute a new universality class of
solutions for the magnetic equation  and they allow to write
well-defined effective actions for supergravity theories with electric
and/or magnetic sources.

Since the non-linear terms in nonlin  are independent of
electric sources, we stress that in the presence of such terms the
Chern-kernel approach is needed to write a well-defined action,
even  if there are only magnetic sources and no electric
ones.

Apart from solving a problem which could look rather formal, in relevant
situations Chern-kernels lead to classical effective actions which exhibit
necessarily  gravitational anomalies  that cancel in string
theory against their quantum counterparts. This can be understood roughly
as follows. Chern-kernels are not uniquely defined since the
universality class admits infinitely many representatives. Two
representatives differ by  and the classical action
has to be invariant under such shifts; in other words the Chern-kernel
has to be "unobservable".
To save this invariance one has
to add counterterms to the classical action which, in turn, give rise
to gravitational anomalies supported on . In all
examples we examined these classical anomalies cancel precisely against
their quantum counterparts, produced by the chiral fields localized on
.

In principle another way out to solve the above problem, i.e. to
keep  free from singularities on the magnetic brane, would be to
substitute the -like current  with a distributed
smooth one , entailing the same total magnetic
charge. This procedure may work in the absence of electric sources
, but at the quantum level smooth magnetic
currents  can not consistently coexist with
electric sources, even if Dirac  holds. This simple but
fundamental point will be clarified in the next section.

Self-dual branes play a special role and exhibit an additional
peculiar feature with respect to a system of branes/dual-branes.
By definition a self-dual brane is a brane minimally coupled to a
self-dual field strength in a -dimensional space-time.
This means that even in the absence of non-linear terms the
minimal coupling  becomes problematic if  has
Dirac-brane-type singularities along . As we will show, in
this case in principle both possibilities  - a Dirac-brane (with
a framing regularization) or a Chern-kernel - are allowed, but
they are physically inequivalent: in the Dirac-brane approach the
dynamics is consistent if the charge is quantized, while in the
Chern-kernel approach there is no need of charge quantization,
but a (classical) gravitational anomaly shows up, which for
consistency should be canceled by a quantum counterpart.
Eventually for self-dual branes it is the particular physical situation 
that decides which approach one has to use.

In section two we review briefly the Dirac-brane approach,
indicating to which extent it can be circumvented in compatibility with
Dirac . In section three we define Chern-kernels for even
and odd ranks and state their main properties, while
section four is devoted to self-dual branes. In section five we
illustrate how Chern-kernels work in a highly non trivial case:
-branes ending on -branes. This is actually a more
general case then the one we referred to above since
the electric current is not conserved and there are quantum
gravitational anomalies not only on the (magnetic) -brane,
but also on the boundary of ; this boundary corresponds indeed
to a self-dual string. Actually, in this case anomaly
cancellation has been realized until now only partially
. Section six gives a further application: a
-duality symmetric action for
bosonic  supergravity with electric and magnetic sources.
Section seven is devoted to concluding remarks.

The present paper provides also some proofs
which, for lack of space, have not been reported in.

A comment on our mathematical framework is in order.
Since our currents  carry a -like support they are not
smooth differential -forms, they are rather distribution valued
so called -currents. 
Consistency then requires that all our differential forms
have to be considered in the space of distributions and that also the
differential operator  acts in the sense of distributions. This implies
that we have always 



and that in a topologically trivial space-time a closed form is always
exact. 
In this framework two caveats are in order: first, the
product of two distributions is in general not a distribution if the
singularities involved are too strong; second, Leibntz's rule does
in general not hold: for even forms the relation
 may not be valid, even if the product
 is well-defined (a trivial example is ,
the sign function). As we will see, in the Chern-kernel approach all our
products will amount to well-defined distributions, and we will have to worry
only about Leibnitz's rule. Henceforth, according to the standard physical 
terminology, we will call the -currents again -forms.  

In most of the paper we assume to be in a topologically trivial space-time,
some topological aspects will be discussed in the concluding section.

Dirac-branes 

We review here briefly the standard Dirac-brane approach, allowing to write
an action for the linear system mag , ele .  is the
-function on the closed worldvolume , more precisely
it is the "Poincare-dual in the space of -currents" of : such 
forms are called integer forms.
For a precise definition and basic properties of this Poincare-duality see 
e.g.. Here we recall that by definition the Poincare-dual
 of a manifold  satisfies
 


for every test form . The integral of
products of integer forms, closed or not, is always integer whenever it is
well defined.
The operator  corresponds to the boundary operator  on manifolds.
If multiplied by a target-space form,  performs the
pullback on :
 



Let  be a closed -dimensional manifold in a -dimensional
space-time. 
Since  is closed we can introduce a -surface   - a
Dirac-brane - whose boundary is , . The
Dirac-brane is clearly not unique: choosing another Dirac-brane we
have  and there exists an interpolating
-surface  such that . The
corresponding relations for the Poincare-duals of these
surfaces are
   J_g=dC_g=dC_g^, C_g^ 
where ,  and  are integer forms of rank 
,  and   respectively.

The first relation of transC  permits to solve
mag  in terms of a potential 
   H=dB+gC_g,
 
and to write then an action giving rise to ele :
   I_1=1G (12 H*H-eB
J_e)I_kin +I_wz ,
 where according to string
theory  for the overall normalization we used Newton's constant.

To keep the field strength invariant under a change of
Dirac-brane we have to require that  transforms as 
  B^B-gW_g, 
 
where, we recall,  is
the -function on the surface . Under this
transformation  is manifestly invariant while the
Wess-Zumino term changes as
   I_wz =egG W_gJ_e.
 Since the integrand is a product of integer forms, the
integral is integer and  is an integer multiple of
 thanks to charge quantization Dirac . From
transB  we retrieve that the potential  is ill-defined
on  because the form  is the -function on the
surface  which, by construction, contains as submanifold
; so  does not admit pullback on  and due to
transB   bears the same fate.

This is in synthesis the standard Dirac-brane construction of an
action for Maxwell equations in the presence of electric and
magnetic sources. Let us now see how stringent it is. First we
note that one can introduce also an arbitrary  antiderivative
 for the conserved electric current, , and rewrite
the Wess-Zumino term as
  I_wz =eG dB K_e=eG HK_e -egG C_gK_e.
 So in the
Dirac-brane approach, as it stands, one has really an asymmetric
treatment for electric and magnetic sources: for the magnetic
source one introduces a Dirac-brane as antiderivative, while for
the electric one one can introduce an arbitrary antiderivative;
but due to duality one expects that the situation can be reversed.
This is indeed the case. Choose for , which is arbitrary, the
Poincare-dual  of an electric Dirac-brane, .
Then the integrand in the last term in trucco  is a product
of integer forms, and the term itself becomes an integer multiple
of  due to charge quantization; it can therefore be
disregarded. The action  can then be rewritten as
 I_2=1G (12 H*H+eHC_e),
 where the
magnetic Dirac-brane does now no longer appear explicitly. This
means that in this form of the action one can take
 H=dB+gK_g,
 with  an arbitrary  antiderivative of
the magnetic current,
  J_g=dK_g.
 As 
had a spurious dependence on the magnetic Dirac-brane, the action
 has now a spurious dependence on the electric Dirac-brane;
for , with  the -function on a
suitable surface,  changes by
 change2 
 I_2=eG HdW_e=-egG J_gW_e,
 again an integer multiple of . It is obvious that 
gives as equation of motion still ele . So the situation is
now indeed reversed: with the price of introducing an
(unobservable) electric Dirac-brane, we can choose for the
magnetic brane an arbitrary form  satisfying anti .

With this simple observation we have now a new possibility for
introducing a potential. The main difference between H1  and
H2  is the following. We have , and this means that
 as well as  are necessarily singular on the magnetic brane because
 is the -function on .
 has -function like singularities along a Dirac-brane, say
along a fixed space-time direction; these singularities are not
universal since there is no preferred direction in space-time:
changing the Dirac-brane changes this space-time direction and
hence the support of the singularities, but this means that 
itself has to change by singular terms - see transB  - interpolating 
between the two different singular behaviours, see also 
. Consider now
the second possibility H2 . In this case  has to
satisfy a priori only   with no further
restrictions; but then, as we know from the Coulomb
electric field whose divergence is a -function, its
singularities can be also of the inverse-power-type, i.e. 
milder then -type singularities: this behaviour is indeed
realized by a Chern-kernel. The problem with
inverse-power-like singularities is that, as in the Dirac-brane
case, a priori they can still change when  changes by a
closed form. This problem will be solved in the next
section.

From change1  and change2  it is also clear that
magnetic and electric branes can coexist only if both
currents  carry a -like support i.e. if both are integer
forms, otherwise either  () or  ()  would not
be an integer form and the integrals appearing in change1 ,
change2  would not be integer; as consequence the action
would not change by an integer multiple of , even if the
charges are quantized. This forbids the use of 
smooth currents if both types of excitations  are present.

Chern-kernels 

Chern-kernels are differential forms  satisfying
 J=dK,
 with a specific singular behaviour near the brane. We take 
as an -form whose Poincare-dual is a closed
-dimensional brane worldvolume  in a -dimensional
space-time; the Chern-kernel is then an -form. The main
motivation for an analysis of its properties is that its defining
relation allows to solve the magnetic equation  as
   H=dB+gK.
 Brane geometry 

We introduce first the main geometrical quantities which are
defined on the brane worldvolume . The brane is parametrized
locally by , , and carries a
-dimensional tangent space spanned by
, .
The normal -fiber is spanned by the vectors
 satisfying
 normal 
N_^a E^_i=0,N_^a
N^b =^ab ,
 where . These basis
vectors for the normal space are defined modulo a local
-rotation,
  N_^a ()=^ab ()N_^b().
 On  we can introduce also an -connection
 (This connection can be parametrized in
terms of the normal vectors by 
, where
 is the pullback on  of the affine space-time
connection. We suppose to work in a curved space-time, so the
indices  are raised and lowered with the metric
 evaluated, in case, on .) , and its curvature
. For later purposes it is convenient
to extend  to an -connection  on the whole
space-time, that is asymptotically flat along directions
orthogonal to the brane. We call the corresponding curvature
,
  A_M=a,F_M=f,
 where  means pullback of a space-time form on . While 
and  are physical data, the quantities  and  are not: so
when they are used at intermediate steps, eventually one has to
show that physics is independent of these unphysical data. This means that 
one can look at  and  as "holographic extensions" of  and 
from  to the whole space-time, which do not introduce new degrees of 
freedom.

To  we can associate also systems of normal coordinates. Such a
system realizes a diffeomorphism from the coordinates  to
the coordinates , with  and
, specified by the functions . As a
power series in  - the normal coordinates - one has
  x^(,y)=x^()+y^aN^a ()+o(y^2).
 Inversion of the diffeomorphism leads to the space-time functions
 with
  y^a_M=0, _y^a_M=N_^a.
 Throughout this paper we suppose that the functions , with
this behaviour on , are globally defined; for more general
situations see and section seven. Again, the physical content 
of these
functions is only their behaviour defy  on , their values 
away from  correspond to unphysical data which
eventually have to be unobservable.

Actually, the behaviour defy  on  is defined up to an
-transformation, as are the normal coordinates themselves.
Formally, through the functions  and , we have
thus extended the -structure to the whole space-time. In
particular we can define the -covariant derivatives
.

For future purposes it is convenient to introduce an additional
(equivalent) -connection  and related curvature
. Set



and define
 shift 
A ^ab =A^ab -2^[a D^b]  A^ab +X^ab .
 This gives for the curvature
 curv 
F ^ab =dA ^ab +A ^ac A ^cb =
F^ab +D^aD^b+2^[a F^b]c ^c.
 The qualifying properties of this connection are that its
curvature has vanishing components along  and that 
is covariantly constant with respect to it,
  ^a F ^ab =0, D(A )^ad^a+^bA ^ba =0.
 Notice that, contrary to  and , the forms  and
 do not admit pullback on .


The Coulomb form 

In terms of normal coordinates the current can be expressed in an
-invariant way as




signaling of course that the brane stays at .

In searching for an -form whose differential equals  a
first attempt would be to consider a generalization of the
three-dimensional Coulomb electric field, more precisely of its
Hodge-dual




corresponding to . This
formula can also be regarded as the angular form on a two-sphere,
with unit integral. Its generalization for a generic  is:
  K_0=(-)^n+1 (n/2) 2
^n/2 (n-1)! ^a_1a_n ^a_1 d^a_2 d^a_n ,
 and it is easy to see that indeed
  dK_0=J.
 The problem with the Coulomb form in coulomb  is that its
(singular) behaviour on , i.e. as , is not
universal but depends on the particular normal coordinate
functions  we have chosen. In other words, it is invariant
under global -rotations, but not under local ones: for
different normal coordinates one has indeed 
, where  is an
-matrix. For the Coulomb form associated to the rotated
normal coordinates we have of course still , and
hence



but the form  is singular on  , because the matrix
 does not reduce to the identity on , meaning
that  and  exhibit different singularities.

The question is then if  admits a completion  carrying an
-invariant singular behaviour  on , which solves
still the magnetic equation ancora . Clearly one should then
have
 dec 
K=K_0+d,
 for a convenient form . The answer to this question is
affirmative, but since it entails completely different features
for even and odd currents we treat the two cases separately. The
difference originates essentially from the fact that the Euler
characteristics of an odd bundle is zero.

Even Chern-kernels 

For  odd the Coulomb-form can be completed to an -invariant
Chern-kernel given by  K= (n/2) 2
^n/2 (n-1)! ^a_1a_n ^a_1 F ^a_2a_3 F ^a_n-1 a_n ,
 where , see equation curv , reduces here
actually to , due to the presence of the
factor .
-invariance is manifest, and one has only to show that
. Consider first the -function contribution to
. It is immediately seen that  contains as building block
 which, for dimensional reasons, is the unique term which can
give rise to a distribution-valued contribution, and we know
already that . It remains to show that formally, i.e.
neglecting the -function contribution,  is closed.
This is obvious if one observes that, since  is invariant, the
differential  can be substituted with the differential
covariant w.r.t. , . The conclusion follows 
then from the second relation in project  and from 
.

Since the expression for  is a polynomial function of  and
 it is also clear that dec  holds with  polynomial
in  and  as well. For  one has e.g.
 




 With respect to , which carries  powers of (the
singular functions) , the even Chern-kernel contains
additional subleading singular terms with powers of  ranging
from 1 to : these subleading terms are required to form an
invariant singular behaviour.

As it stands  depends on the data  and ,
whose behaviour away  from  is unphysical. The dependence
on these data is in some sense analogous to the dependence on the
Dirac-brane in the Dirac-brane approach, and it must be
compensated by a transformation of the potential , see
H22 . Changes in these data ,
 are constrained  by the boundary values on
, restr  and defy , where they must reduce to an
-rotation . Since we have in any case
, the most general changes can be
parametrized by
   ^= ,A^(A+W) ^T
 -d^T,
 where  and the arbitrary Lie-algebra valued one-form
 is constrained only to vanish on ,
  W_M=0.
  Consider now the relation between two different Chern-kernels;
since the differential of a Chern-kernel equals always  it is
clear that the difference is an exact form,
 qt1 
K^=K+dQ.
 But change  implies that moreover
   Q_M=0.
 Indeed, due to -invariance
 



and since  is independent of  dec  gives
 


 which contains at least one power of . For  one has
 


Equation change  implies then qm .

This shows not only that the even Chern-kernel has a universal
singular behaviour on  (for that it would be sufficient to show
that  is a well defined form), but also that the pullback of
the  potential  is a completely invariant form: since
invariance of the field strength in H22  demands
  B^ one gets
 


We call the transformations qt1 , qt2  -transformations ; the dynamics of a physical theory must be
independent of the particular Chern-kernel used as antiderivative
of , meaning that its action has to be invariant under such
transformations. -invariance will therefore be a guiding
principle for constructing consistent actions for magnetic branes
with non-linear interactions; in the presence of closed electric branes
we must, in addition, require independence of the action of the
electric Dirac-brane. In this sense -invariance plays a role
similar to unobservability of a Dirac-brane: the transformations
transC  and transB  coincide indeed formally with
qt1  and qt2 .

We emphasize that in this framework the physical gravitational normal bundle
-transformations on  arise as -transformations restricted to
, with transformation parameter , see changes .

Since even Chern-kernels have an invariant behaviour near the
brane and lead, therefore, to potentials which are invariant when
evaluated on the brane, one might think that even Chern-kernels
have nothing to do with gravitational anomalies localized on the
brane; this is however not the case since products of an even
number of Chern-kernels are cohomologically equivalent to
characteristic classes, i.e. to invariant polynomials of the
normal bundle -curvature  which, upon descent, give rise to
gravitational anomalies. An important example in which the even
Chern-kernel-approach leads to cancellation of the quantum
normal bundle anomaly is represented by the -brane, see
. For this reason we discuss in the next subsection the
basic properties of such products.

Products of even Chern-kernels 

In this section we derive algebraic relations involving
powers of the even Chern-kernel, which are needed in the
construction of effective actions for -branes in -theory,
see section five.

In general the product of two distributions does not define a
distribution, but in the case of even Chern-kernels the product
 defines still a distribution-valued differential form,
with again inverse-power-like singularities on . Contrary to
, however, the even powers such as  are closed forms. This
is not in contrast with  since what fails here is Leibnitz's
rule: the formal computation  makes indeed no sense
because  does not admit pullback on ; we must first evaluate
the product and then take the differential. We will actually now
show that there exists a form , polynomial in  and  but
not -invariant, such that (see also)
 product 
KK=14 d S.
 We begin with the evaluation of . Recalling that 
, from the definition even  this product is easily seen to
reduce to a combination of traces of . Setting  one obtains
 


where  is the -th Pontrjagin form. Remembering
shift , a standard transgression formula gives then
 kk 
 P(F )=P(F)+dY,
 where  is an -invariant  -form, polynomial in
 and , singular on :
   Y=2m_0^1 P(F_t,,F_t,X)dt,
 where  and . This leads to
( differs from the canonical
Chern-Simons form , associated to
, by a closed form.) 
  S=P^0(A)+Y,
 where  is the Chern-Simons form associated to .
For generic characteristic classes we use the descent notation
 


The form  is made out of two contributions:  is non-invariant but
regular on , while  is invariant but singular on , due to the
presence of the singular form . For  one has
  P(F)&=&-12(2)^2 tr F^2,

 P^0(A)&=&-12(2)^2 tr(AdA+23 A^3),

 Y&=&-1(2)^2 ^a D^b F^ab . From the formulae above it is clear that  is a closed form. What
happens is essentially that  contains only odd  powers of
's - in particular the Coulomb form whose differential gives
rise to  - while  contains only even  powers of
's and so no -function contributions can show up in
its differential.

In considering the triple product  one encounters the form
 which can be seen to be closed too, more precisely one has
 serve 
d(YK)=dYK.
 The key point is again to see if the product  contains terms
whose differential can give rise to -function
contributions (For an alternative proof see appendix A.) .
Such terms must contain precisely  powers of
, as . In this case we observe that  (), being
invariant, contains only even (odd) powers of ; this means
that  contains only odd powers of , with maximum power
 (because the product of  or more of them is zero by
antisymmetry). So the maximum power of  showing up in 
is , and no Coulomb form can appear. This means that one can
compute the differential of  algebraically, i.e. ignoring
-function contributions, and serve  follows.

Since  is regular on  we can summarize these properties
as
 chain 
 dK=J,d(KK)=0,d(KKK)=14 P(F)J.
 Odd Chern-kernels 

In this case the current  is an even form, , and a
construction like even  is no longer available. On the other
hand, the normal bundle of the brane is now even and one can
define an -Euler form , and the associated
Chern-Simons form , in a standard way:
 euler 
(F)=1m! (4)^m ^a_1a_n F^a_1a_2  F^a_n-1 a_n d^0(A).
 We will now show that the odd Chern-kernel can be written as a
sum (Strictly speaking, the "odd spherical kernel" introduced by
Chern is .) 

 odd 
 K=+^0(A),
 where  is the -invariant -form, polynomial in 
 and , given in trans . So the main difference between even 
and odd Chern-kernels is that the former are -invariant forms,
while the latter are not, due to the presence of the
Chern-Simons form.

To prove that the expression in odd  satisfies , and
to find an explicit expression for  we start from the
observation that the Euler form of the curvature 
 vanishes identically,
 zero 
 (F )=0.
 This is a direct consequence of 
(More concretely, take the identity 
, which holds because
one has  antisymmetric indices, and contract it with
.) . On the other hand, the shift-relation shift 
allows to express the Euler form for  in terms of the
Euler form for ,
 basic 
(F )=(F)+d where, defining as above  and ,
according to standard transgression one has
 trans 
 (F_t,,F_t,X)dt.
 This explains the algebraic contributions in basic ; the
subtraction of  is necessary because by direct inspection one
can see that  contains as top form in  precisely the Coulomb 
form , and
since our differential acts in the sense of distributions this
implies that  contains as -function contribution
precisely , which has to be subtracted. The  identities
zero  and basic  ensure then that .

The evaluation of the transgression formula trans  is
straightforward, for  one obtains e.g.
 &=&- 12(4)^2 ^a_1a_4 ^a_1 D^a_2  ( 4F^a_3a_4 +
8 3 D^a_3 D^a_4 ),

^0(A)&=&12(4)^2 ^a_1a_4 (
A^a_1a_2 dA^a_3a_4 + 23 A^a_1a_2 (
AA)^a_3a_4  ),

&=& -12(4)^2 ^a_1a_4  ^a_1 
    ( 4d^a_2  +2^b A^ba_2 ) A^a_3a_4 ,
 where the form  refers to the decomposition dec  which
holds clearly also for odd kernels. Notice in particular in
 the presence of the Coulomb form .

Also the odd kernel is subject to -transformations, i.e. to
the changes ,  as
the even one (see changes ) and we have also here



for some . This time one gets




Since the Chern-Simons forms differ by the -rotation 
we have



leading to



where in  we suppressed the dependence on . The
pullback of  on  is then again finite, but now different
from zero. Since  one gets



where, we recall,  is the (physical) -connection on
, .  For an infinitesimal transformation the form
 is really the descent of the Euler form on ,




For the pullback of the potential we obtain then the anomalous
transformation law
 B^_M=B_M-g^1(a).
 We can summarize the results of this section as follows. The odd
Chern-kernel is made out of two terms, one is singular on  and
the other is regular. The singular contribution  is
invariant and encodes, therefore, the  singularities of   in a
universal way. Vice versa, the regular contribution 
transforms non trivially under . For the potential  this
implies that it admits a finite pullback  that under
-transformations undergoes an anomalous
-transformation.

It is clear that the anomalous transformation law for  plays
a role in gravitational anomaly cancellation in -theory; for a
basic examplification of this feature - for  - in the case
of the anomalies of the -brane in ,
-supergravity, see reference. In the next section
we illustrate the occurrence of odd Chern-kernels in a further
important case: self-dual branes.

For computational reasons sometimes it may be useful, though not
strictly necessary, to have at ones disposal regularized currents
and associated regularized Chern-kernels, i.e. a  family of forms
 and  with , which are regular at 
for any , such that in the sense of distributions



In appendix A we present a particular
class of such regularizations, which goes under the name of
"real algebraic approximation mode", that keeps the currents
and the even Chern-kernels invariant, and that preserves the transformation
properties of the odd kernels. Such regularized objects are
useful for example in determining the singularity structures of products
involving Chern-kernels and currents.


 Self-dual branes and chiral bosons 

Self-dual branes are closed branes with a -dimensional
worldvolume , coupling in a -dimensional space-time
minimally to a chiral boson. More precisely we have the
equations
 dH&=&gJ

H&=&*H
,
 where the current  is a -form, the -function on .
The magnetic and electric Maxwell equations are thus identified.

In writing an
action for this system  one has to face two problems; the first regards
the construction of a covariant action for the chiral boson, a problem
which is elegantly solved by the PST-approach. The second
problem
regards the introduction of a potential . Formally the PST-approach
furnishes the action
   I=12G (H*H-H _-*H _-)-gG _M B,
 where , and  is the auxiliary
non-propagating PST-vector. This action leads to the equation of
motion , once one has solved the magnetic equation
magn  in terms of a potential. In principle we have now two
ways for doing so.

1) Dirac-branes.  We can introduce a Dirac-brane for ,
with Poincare-dual ,  and write . This gives
 


and  has the known singularities on . Consequently the
Wess-Zumino term in the action  is ill-defined, even
in this elementary case with only a minimal interaction. But since
formally  gives rise to the correct -equation of motion it may
nevertheless be meaningful to compute its Dirac-anomaly, i.e. its
response under a change of Dirac-brane. One has ,
 where (see transC )  is the -function
on a manifold  whose boundary is made out of the old and new
Dirac-branes.  changes then by
 


where the integral would count the number of intersections between
 and . But since  is a submanifold of   this integral
is ill-defined.

The situation can be saved by introducing a framing
regularization. We replace the surface  in   with a
surface  (and the current  with ) obtained from
 by displacing each point of  by an amount  in an
arbitrary direction. This gives instead of 
 


where the integral is now well-defined and integer. The
Dirac-brane is then unobservable if the charge is quantized as




One may ask if this simple regularization procedure could be
invoked also to regularize the self-interactions nonlin  of
a magnetic brane. This is not the case, for two reasons: first,
the terms in nonlin  are non-linear (quadratic) while the
equation of motion for a chiral boson () is linear and, second, the
equation of motion itself is well-defined,
while the non-linear terms in nonlin  involve  and
are ill-defined.

2) Chern-kernels.  We can introduce an odd Chern-kernel
such that  and write
 


In this case the potential is regular on , the integral 
 is well-defined and we have only to worry about
-invariance. As we know, the pullback of  changes according
to an -transformation, , and
this implies that  carries the normal bundle gravitational
anomaly



corresponding to the anomaly polynomial ,
i.e. to the -Euler form. A consistent
dynamics requires then the cancellation of this classical anomaly,
for example by the quantum anomaly produced by chiral fields
localized on .

In conclusion, for self-dual branes both possibilities -
Dirac-branes and Chern-kernels - are available, and which one
has to be used depends on the physical content of the theory. In
the absence of quantum gravitational anomalies one would use
Dirac-branes together with a framing regularization and impose charge 
quantization, while in their
presence Chern-kernels can play a central role in their
cancellation upon choosing particular values for the charges. The
availability of this second possibility is indeed crucial for the
consistency, at the quantum level, of the situation considered in
the next section.

-branes ending on -branes 

The effective action for closed -branes interacting with
closed -branes through eleven-dimensional supergravity  has
been constructed in; it employs a four-form
Chern-kernel for the -brane current and realizes the
cancellation of the residual -brane normal bundle anomaly, which is an
-anomaly. The -brane carries an odd-dimensional
worldvolume and entails no anomalies; it is moreover closed, so
the coupling to the -brane could be performed in a standard
way introducing a Dirac-three-brane, as explained in section two
of the present paper, and the dynamics is quantum mechanically
consistent if charge quantization holds.

But in eleven-dimensional space-time an -brane can have
also an open worldvolume, under the condition that its boundary
belongs to an -brane; in this respect
-branes can be really considered as Dirichlet-branes for
eleven-dimensional membranes, as pointed out in.
The principal differences w.r.t to closed -branes are the
following; first, for open membranes no natural Dirac-brane can
be defined (and no one is needed); second, the boundary of the
membrane is a string describing a two-dimensional worldvolume and
as such it is plagued by gravitational anomalies;
third, since open membranes must end on 5-branes the interaction
between the two surfaces is more intricate then in the closed case
where the relative position of the two surfaces is arbitrary; the
open membrane exhibits instead a contact-interaction with the
5-brane and this leads a priori to additional singularities
located at its boundary. The boundary of the membrane couples,
moreover, minimally to the chiral two-form present on the
5-brane and so it becomes actually a self-dual string.

We will show that all these problematic features are naturally and
elegantly solved by the Chern-kernel approach, if the -brane
charge  and the -brane charge  assume their -theory
values
 minimal 
g^3=2G,e=g^2,
 leading for the brane tensions to the standard relations
 



The results of the present section are summarized in the
Wess-Zumino action l12 , based on an odd and an even
Chern-kernel, which cancels the quantum gravitational anomalies
of the system.



Normal bundles and quantum gravitational anomalies 

Calling the -brane worldvolume , its boundary  and
the -brane worldvolume  we have
   M_3=M_2 M_6, M_6=0=M_2.
 On the -brane the eleven-dimensional Lorentz group
 reduces to the structure group
 struct 
SO(1,5)SO(5),
 where  is its tangent group and  the invariance
group of its normal bundle. Since there are chiral fields
localized at , i.e. the chiral two-form potential  and
the 32-component Green-Schwarz spinor  of ,
the structure group is plagued by gravitational anomalies. The
associated -brane eight-form anomaly polynomial can be
rewritten as the sum,
 m5anom 
2(I_8_M_6 +124 P_8),
 where  is the second Pontrjagin form of the normal bundle
-curvature , and  is the polynomial of the
target-space -curvature , which corrects eleven-dimensional
supergravity by the term . Clearly,
since  can be written in terms of normal and tangent
curvatures, the -tangent bundle is anomalous as well.

On  the structure group struct  reduces further
according to
 SO(1,5)&& SO(1,1)SO_a(4) 

SO(5)&& SO_b(4), where  is the normal group of  with respect to , and
 is its tangent group.
The reduction of  to  occurs along the component normal to
 of the unique  direction on
 which is normal to  and tangent to .
In conclusion, the structure group on  is



The Green-Schwarz spinor reduces on  to a set of fermions
which are chiral w.r.t this group and they give therefore
rise to gravitational anomalies; the corresponding four-form
anomaly polynomial has been determined in and reads
(With respect to reference we added a
factor of 1/2 since the Green-Schwarz fermion is Majorana.) 
 m1anom 
(_b-_a),
 where  are the Euler-forms of the
-bundles. Notice in particular that the
-tangent bundle is anomaly free.

A consistent low energy effective action for the system 
must therefore cancel simultaneously the anomaly m5anom 
supported on , and the anomaly m1anom  supported on
.

Currents, Chern-kernels and equations of motion 

In this section we have to distinguish target-space forms,
defined in eleven-dimensional space-time, from forms defined
only on . Generically we will indicate the former with capital
letters and the latter with small letters. One has to take some care
when considering products of forms which are defined on different
manifolds. Indeed, in general the formal product 
between forms defined on different manifolds does not define a
form, but it defines a form say on  if  is the
-function on  w.r.t.  and  is a form on
, see.

We indicate the Poincare-duals of ,  and 
respectively with ,  and , where the subscripts
indicate the degrees of the forms. Since  is a submanifold of 
 we can also define the Poincare-dual of  w.r.t. to :
this is a four-form on  which we indicate with
. Then the relations ending  translate into
 currents 
 dJ_8=J_9,j_4J_5=J_9,dJ_5=0=dj_4.
 The starting point for the construction of the bosonic effective
action for  supergravity  interacting with - and
-branes is a set of consistent equations of motion for the
physical fields of the system. These are the space-time metric
and a three-form potential  in the target-space , the
coordinates and a (Born-Infeld like) chiral two-form  on
, and the coordinates on . Concentrating on the dynamics
of the potentials  and  and calling their field-strengths
 and  respectively we can write their Bianchi identities
(magnetic equations) and equations of motion as
 1 
dH&=&gJ_5

d*H&=&12 HH+ghJ_5+g^2I_8 +eJ_8

dh&=&dB_M_6 +eg j_4

h&=&*h+(n.l.t.) , where the non-linear terms in the self-duality equation for 
4  correspond to the Born-Infeld lagrangian, see the next section.
The form of these equations is almost uniquely fixed by the
requirement of generalized charge conservation for , i.e. by
the requirement that the r.h.s. of 2  is a closed form
(Our differential acts from the right: 
.) . However, to check this
closure one must first express  and  in terms of  and
, solving 1  and 3 . According to the strategy
developed in this paper we introduce an even  four-form
Chern-kernel  for , a target-space form, and an odd
 three-form Chern-kernel
 for  (Remember that  is indeed the normal
group of  with respect to .) , a form on :



The -kernel is written explicitly in k4  and the
-kernel is just the sum of omega  and
chernsimons . The choice of a Chern-kernel for ,
instead of a Dirac-brane, is advisable because  is a
self-dual string plagued by quantum gravitational anomalies, [see
m1anom ]. On the other hand, the presence of the products
 and  in 2  forbids the use of Dirac-branes
also for : the first term contains  and , see
nonlin , and the second term, using a Dirac-brane 
instead of the Chern-kernel , would contain a term ,
which is the square of a -function.

The field strengths read then
  H&=&dB+gK

 h&=&db+B_M_6 +eg k.
 With these determinations, using currents  and the product
formulae for even Chern-kernels of section three, it is
straightforward to verify that 2  closes.

Since  is odd, under an -transformation on  we have,
as remnant of the -transformation of , the anomalous
transformation law
 anomb 
 b_M_2 =-eg _a^1.
 Anomaly free effective action 

We write the effective action for our system as



where  is the quantum effective action carrying the
anomalies m5anom  and m1anom , and the classical
action  must by definition give rise to the
equations of motion 2  and 4 . The kinetic terms are
the standard ones,
 kin 
 S_kin =_M_11   d^11 x-g R-12 _M_11  H*H -g_M_6 d^6-g L (h)-e _M_3 d^3-g ,
 where , made out of the Born-Infeld Lagrangian
(written in a manifestly
covariant way a la PST, see subsection 6.1),
contains the kinetic terms for the -brane coordinates as well
as for . Here it suffices to know that it depends on 
only through the invariant field strength .

The Wess-Zumino term is written usually as the integral of an
eleven-form; here we choose the equivalent alternative to write
it as the integral of a closed twelve-from on a
twelve-dimensional manifold with boundary,




We are here assuming the absence of topological obstructions. One
advantage of this procedure is the manifest invariance of 
under all relevant symmetries, while usually  is invariant
only up to a closed form. This approach requires to extend the
target-space fields to , and in particular to
extend every involved -brane to a -brane whose
restriction on  reduces to the -brane.
Closed branes extend to closed branes, and the boundary of the
extended -brane has to belong to the extended -brane.
This procedure maintains then the degrees of the current-forms
,  etc. and hence of the Chern-kernels and of the
dimensions of the normal bundles. With an abuse of language we
indicate the extended worldvolumes still with their
eleven-dimensional names, e.g. , even if it is now a
six-brane with a seven-dimensional worldvolume.

The crucial ingredient of this construction is then the
twelve-form
 L_12 &=&16 HHH+g2 hdB J_5+g^2I_8H
      +g^3(I_7^0 +124 P_7^0)J_5

      && +eHJ_8+e2 (db+B+g_b^0)J_9,
 where we introduced the canonical Chern-Simons forms: ,
, .
This formula is the unique solution to the following three
requirements:
1) It must give rise to the equations of motion
2  and 4 .
2) It must be closed.
3) It must be -invariant in the bulk, i.e. apart from
terms supported on the branes.

The equations of motion fix indeed all terms in  which depend
on  or . The terms which are independent of these fields are
fixed by the requirements 2) and 3).
The formula is, actually, manifestly invariant under -transformations
of : this potential shows up in the combination  or as  and
both are invariant. The potential  shows up as  , which is invariant,
and as  which transforms by an -transformation according
to anomb . Eventually, the terms
 and 
are needed to make  a closed form, as can be seen using
- before differentiation - the product formulae of section three
(That  is closed for ,
i.e. in the absence of -branes, has been shown in.) .
The unique non trivial point, in checking that , is to show that
there exists a three-form  on   such that (This relation
requires the consistency condition , which
is indeed true, but to prove it one can not use naively Leibnitz's rule, see
appendix  .) 
KJ_8+12 _b^0J_9=d(X J_8).
 A proof of this relation, together with an explicit expression for ,
are reported in appendix . For our purposes the defining
relation ll11  is sufficient, because it determines all
properties of  modulo a closed form.

Another important point regarding  is that the
Chern-Simons forms  and  appear evaluated
respectively on the worldvolumes  and , so that no
unphysical extensions of the - and
-connections show up.

Eventually we can also give an explicit expression for the
Wess-Zumino action, written in eleven-dimensional space
(),
  L_11 &=&16 BdBdB +g2 BdBK
 -g2 b(dB+eg j_4)J_5
+g^2B(I_8+12 KK) 

 &&+eB(J_8+12 kJ_5)
+ g^3(I_7^0+124 (P_7^0+Y_7))K +egXJ_8,
 where the invariant form  is defined in y  - see
 for an explicit expression -  and we recall that
.
The -dependence of  is fixed by the
Bianchi identity 3  and by the PST-symmetries or,
equivalently, by the equation of motion 4 . To derive the
-equation of motion 2  from 
, the only non trivial
point is the knowledge of the variation of the Born-Infeld action
under a generic variation of ; taking advantage from 4 
one obtains,




The integral  is clearly also invariant under the
ordinary gauge transformations




-invariance and gravitational anomalies 

The terms in  which are not fixed by the equations of
motion are the ones multiplying  and  in the second line
of l11 ; they are indeed crucial to establish
-invariance of the Wess-Zumino action and they introduce, in
turn, gravitational anomalies.

The invariance under -transformations for  of the
Wess-Zumino action in its eleven-dimensional form is less
obvious than in its manifestly invariant twelve-dimensional form;
for  this invariance has been explicitly verified in
, proving the necessity of the -terms. The
necessity of the term  is again a consequence of
this invariance; under
 


concentrating on the terms proportional to  in , one is left
with the -variation
 


which should cancel against the variation of .
The transformation property of  can be deduced from
its defining relation ll11 ,
 


where  vanishes because  vanishes on , and hence also
on . This gives
 XQ 
_M_11   XJ_8 =_M_11  QJ_8,
  and
 


This proves that  is necessary to restore
-invariance of . On the other hand, ll11 
implies also that under -transformations one has
 


and therefore
   _M_11  (egXJ_8) =-eg2  _M_2 _b^1,
 which represents a gravitational anomaly.

Under -transformations of  (see anomb )
 



the Wess-Zumino action is invariant up to a gravitational
anomaly, as can be seen by direct inspection,
 anoma 
  _M_11  L_11 =e^22g _M_2 _a^1.
 Eventually one can compute the gravitational anomalies carried by the
Wess-Zumino action. Using l12  and anomb  (or l11 ,
anoml11  and anoma ) one sees that there are anomalies
supported on  and ,
 anom 
(1G S_wz ) =-g^3G _M_6 (I_6^1+124 P_6^1)-eg2G _M_2 (_b^1-eg^2 _a^1).
 These classical anomalies cancel just against the quantum ones,
m5anom  and m1anom , if the charges satisfy
minimal .

We may rephrase this result as follows. Once we have introduced
the Chern-kernels  and , it is straightforward to write a "minimal"
classical action which gives rise to the equations of motion
2  and 4 , since all terms depending on  and  are fixed.
This action is
,
where  is given in l11  but without the terms
in  and . This would lead to the total effective action
(classical + quantum)




Since  carries already the
-anomaly polynomial  on , the effective action
 is plagued by the gravitational anomalies
 on  and  on ,
but also by -anomalies.
What we have shown in this paper is the non-trivial fact that there
exists the counterterm
 



which cancels the gravitational  and -anomalies simultaneously .

The values minimal  for the charges,
which ensure anomaly cancellation, satisfy in particular the
Dirac-quantization condition  with ; this is,
actually, a remarkable coincidence since the Dirac-quantization
results in general from an unobservability-requirement of the
Dirac-brane, but in the present case no Dirac-brane at all was
introduced, because the -brane has a boundary.
The physical meaning of this coincidence can be traced back to the
limiting case in which the open -brane becomes a closed one
and leaves the -brane. Since the -charge remains
unchanged during this process and since a closed -brane is
consistent if its charge satisfies the Dirac-quantization
condition, one expects that our Wess-Zumino action for an open
membrane reduces to the one of a closed one, if the boundary of
the membrane shrinks to zero. In particular, in this limit a
Dirac-brane for  should in turn appear. This happens, indeed, as
follows. As the -brane closes one has to take simultaneously
the limits



The field strength  reduces to , and the unique
contribution of order  surviving in l12  is . It
contributes to the classical action with
 


Since the membrane is now closed, , we can introduce a
Dirac-brane and write . Using  the
interaction above can then be rewritten as
 


The second term is an (irrelevant) integer multiple of  and
the first term reproduces the standard interaction between closed
branes and dual branes, see I2 . The integral  reduces
correspondingly to the Wess-Zumino action for interacting closed -
and -branes, constructed in.

 duality-invariant action 

In this section we present a classical action, equivalent to the
one constructed in the previous section, which involves the
three-form potential  - now we call it  and the field
strength  - and its dual six-from potential ,
in a duality symmetric and manifestly Lorentz-invariant way. For
the problems regarding such a construction when one uses
Dirac-branes instead of Chern-kernels see reference.
The knowledge of a consistent duality-invariant action may be
useful for various purposes, for example for the investigation of
the flux quantization conditions of the dual curvature , or
for an analysis of dimensional reductions involving dual branes
and dual potentials. Eventually such an action allows
also a comparison with the -brane -model action
 (where the supergravity  fields are treated
as source-less i.e. they satisfy the equations of motion of pure
supergravity), because also the construction of the -model action
involves necessarily  as well as .

PST-action for  

We rewrite the classical action of the previous section
(disregarding the kinetic terms for the metric and for the
-brane, which are irrelevant for the present purposes)
 action 
 S_0[B_3,b,c]=-12 _M_11  H_4*H_4 -g_M_6 d^6-g 
L (h)+_M_11  L_11 .
 In this subsection
we review briefly the basic ingredients of the PST-approach for the
self-interacting chiral two-form , specifying 
in particular the lagrangian . One introduces
an auxiliary scalar field  on , and constructs
the unit vector
 


Then one can define two  two-forms on , contracting  and  with
this vector:
 



where  is the one-form .
In terms of these data one has
 






and the precise form of the equation of motion 4  is
 H =W (H )d^id^j
L _BI H ^ij  .
 Since we have 
, and
 is the same as , precise  is
indeed a non-linear version of .
After fixing the PST-symmetries, see below, the action 
gives rise to precise . This equation of motion can indeed
be rewritten in a manifestly Lorentz-invariant way, and the PST-symmetries
ensure correspondingly that  is non propagating.


The potential  and its curvature  

The first step in writing a duality-invariant action consists
in the introduction of a dual potential, i.e. in the solution
of the -equation of motion 2  in terms of a potential. Once this
is done in a consistent way, the construction of the duality-invariant
action a la PST is almost canonical.

A consistent reconstruction of a potential  relies on the fact
that the r.h.s. of 2  is a well defined invariant closed  form,
so it can be written as the differential of some seven-form. To make this
seven-form explicit we must introduce a new target-space form  whose
existence is guaranteed by
 


This allows to recast the Bianchi identity 1  for  and its
equation of motion 2 , in the equivalent system of equations
 H_4&=&dB_3+gK,

H_7&=&dB_6+12 B_3dB_3+g(db +B_3)K+
g^2(I_7^0+18 (P_7^0+Y_7))+eO_7,

  H_4&=&*H_7.
 The dual potential is defined a priori up to a field redefinition;
the choice H7  corresponds to a choice for  which is regular
on  , as we will see now. The necessity of a regular  results from
the fact that the duality-invariant action will contain the minimal coupling
.

In the formula for  we introduced a field  which represents
an unphysical (holographic) target-space extension of the two-form 
potential  on ,
 


so let us first establish that the extension is unobservable. Changing the
extension we have
 



which leads in  to a change 
.
 is kept invariant if  changes accordingly by
   B_6^=-gbK.
 Notice that this transformation keeps  invariant
(There exists an alternative definition of a six-form potential
which avoids the extension of : you can choose the singular potential
. This gives
 



and no unphysical extension of  shows up. But with this potential
the formula for  shows up a -like singularity
on  (the term ),
which is canceled by the singularity contained in .
Use of the potential  and of an extended  makes this
cancellation explicit.) .

The field-strength  contains necessarily singularities
near  and, as in the case of the four-form field-strength , these
singularities have to be universal (The pullback of  to
 vanishes for dimensional reasons, so the singularities we are speaking
about are considered in the algebraic sense.) .
To make them explicit we should know the singular behaviour of  near
the -brane. From
its defining relation - which determines it modulo a closed form - it is
clear that there exists a choice, such that its singular part near  is
. Since , ,  and  are regular near ,
the universal singular behaviours of the curvatures are given by
 [H_4]_sing  &=& gK, 

[H_7]_sing  &=& ghK+g^28 Y_7. The consistency of this construction requires now that under
-transformations of ,  is invariant in compatibility with a
regular transformation law  for  on  (Since the
r.h.s. of
2  is -invariant, it is obvious that there exists always a
transformation  which keeps  invariant; it is less trivial
that  is finite on .) . Due to the presence of the
-Chern-Simons form  in , one expects that under
-transformations one has the remnant anomalous -transformation
 b6trans1 
 B_6_M_6 =-g^28 P^1_6_M_6 .
 Since  is -invariant, to deduce the transformation of 
one must first determine the transformation law of
 


Under , since , one obtains easily
  S^P ,
 for some six-form . But we have also
, and since  and
 have the same (singular) behaviour near  we get
, and therefore
 


Comparing this with Strans  and remembering that  we get, 
apart from a closed form,
  P _M_6 =P_6^1_M_6 .
 Using Strans  it is  eventually straightforward to show that  is
-invariant under
    K^&=&K+dQ,

   B_3^&=&B_3-gQ,

   B_6^&=&B_6-g(db+12 B_3)Q
       -g^28 P ,
 which proves also that  has a regular transformation law on
, given by b6trans1 . Under -transformations
one must obviously also have
 b6trans2 
B_6=-g^2 I_6^1.
  is also invariant under ordinary gauge transformations,
  B_3=d_2,B_6=d_5-12 _2dB_3,b=d_1-_2.
 Duality-invariant action and PST-symmetries 

Once we have introduced a dual potential the construction of a
duality-invariant action, according to the PST-approach, requires the
introduction of an auxiliary target-space scalar field . Due to
the presence of a chiral field on the -brane, whose action required
already an auxiliary field  on , as shown inthe consistency of the whole construction demands now that  is the
pullback of ,
 


Apart from this, the construction proceeds as follows. Define the
target-space vector
 


and the target-space three- and six-forms
 


which realize the decomposition
 decomp 
   H_4-*H_7=-(Vf_3+*Vf_6), V=dC/CC .
 Then the duality-invariant action is given in terms of action  by
 duinv 
S[B_3,B_6,b,C]=S_0[B_3,b,c]
+12 _M_11  f_3*f_3.
 In this new framework  and  are defined in terms of  and 
as in H4  and H7 , and the duality relation  is
promoted to an equation of motion which should be produced by  together
with the -equation precise  
Despite the explicit appearance of  in  the
action  is actually only a functional of , as explained in the previous
subsection. .

We show now that  entails the same dynamics as , i.e. that the two
actions are physically equivalent. The starting point are
the equations of motion for , ,  and ; the complete set,
and their derivation, is given in appendix C. For our purposes it is
sufficient to know the equations for  and , which read
  d(Vf_3)&=&0, 

d(Vf_6)&=&gv(H -W )J_5 -Vf_3H_4, where  and  are defined in subsection 6.1.
Knowledge of these equations is sufficient because the -equation is
implied by the -equation (as
a direct consequence of the gauge invariance ,
), and the
the -equation is identically satisfied if the other three equations of
motion hold. This is a consequence of the fact that  is a non-propagating
auxiliary field. The action  is in fact invariant 
(see appendix C for the proof) under the
PST-transformations  
 uno 
b=dC_1,B_3=dC _2,
B_6=dC_5,C=0,
 with transformation parameters ,  and ,
and under 
 C&=&,

b&=&
[1cc  (H -W )],

B_3&=&CC  f_3,

B_6&=&CC  f_6-12 B_3B_3 -gbK, where  is a scalar transformation parameter; with
 we indicate an
arbitrary target-space extension of the two-form between brackets.

 being arbitrary, the symmetry  ensures that the auxiliary field
 is non propagating, and the symmetries 
allow to reduce the equations of motion b6  and b3  to
 


which proves that  and  are equivalent. To see how this happens
consider the most general solution of b6 ,
 


for some two-form . Since under a transformation
 of  we have , we can use this
symmetry (with ) to set . This is the same
as
 


because  identically. At this point, taking the differential
of b3  one gets (The -equation of motion is precisely
obtained by taking the differential of the -equation, see appendix C.) 
 


and one can use the same procedure as above -
using the symmetry  of  - to reduce this equation to
 


This simplifies eventually the -equation to ,
and the symmetry  of  can be used to reduce it further to .
The identity decomp  completes then the proof.

Comparison with the -brane -model 

The action presented in the present paper describes a fully interacting theory
of dynamical supergravity with dynamical brane-like sources, as is appropriate
to discuss, for example, anomaly cancellation. On the contrary
the -brane -model actionconstrains the supergravity fields to satisfy the (source-less)
equations of motion of pure  Sugra, as required by
-symmetry. In the comparison this fundamental difference has to be
taken into account.

The bosonic part of the -model action reads
 



where , since we disregard here the -brane
(). The structure of the Wess-Zumino term (the second integral) 
is fixed by invariance
under the ordinary gauge transformations ordinary . Since
the -model action contains as main building block the standard 
minimal coupling term , to make the
comparison we should view our action  from the
-point-of-view. This can be done using the identity
 



which is once more a consequence of decomp . This allows to rewrite 
as
 S&=&S_kin +S_wz ,

S_kin &=&12 _M_11  (H_7*H_7+f_6*f_6)
-g_M_6 d^6-g L (h),

S_wz &=&_M_11  (L_11 -H_4H_7).
 This form of the action privileges indeed the role of the
potential : it appears only through the canonical kinetic
term  (apart from the square of the six-form
 which vanishes on-shell), and through the standard minimal
coupling to the -brane contained in . The kinetic
term for the -brane in  is already the same
as in , and the Wess-Zumino action  can 
be split in the three contributions,
 S_wz &=&S_wz ^sugra +S_wz ^+S_wz ^int ,

         S_wz ^sugra &=&-13 _M_11  B_3dB_3dB_3,

         S_wz ^&=&g_M_6 (B_6-12 bdB_3),


         S_wz ^int &=&-g_M_11  (B_3dB_3K+gB_3KK
             +g^2             12 (P_7^0+Y_7)K)+g_M_6 bdB_3, where all three contributions are separately invariant under the
ordinary gauge transformations ordinary . 
represents the pure supergravity contribution: the coefficient
 instead of  of the standard -based Sugra is due
to the fact that this scheme privileges .  is
indeed the -model Wess-Zumino action showing up in
.  Very naively one could have expected that the total
Wess-Zumino action is simply , but
the fact is that  while  is -invariant (modulo
gravitational anomalies)  is not. The additional
interaction terms of   (of order , , and
) cure this non-invariance. By direct inspection one sees
indeed that
 



which is manifestly -invariant (modulo gravitational
anomalies). Eventually, it is only the total action, Wess-Zumino
+ kinetic terms, that is invariant under PST-symmetries.

Finally it is instructive to  analyze how the duality-invariant
action realizes the cancellation of the gravitational -brane
anomalies.  is invariant and 
carries the anomaly (see b6trans1  and b6trans2 ),
 


but this would not be the right amount to cancel the quantum
anomaly . But also  carries an
anomaly, , and it ensures hence the
matching; gravitational anomalies and -invariance are once
more entangled.

Our duality invariant-action  can be compared also with the 
duality-invariant action  of, formula (5.28), 
that is based on 
a Dirac-brane approach. In that action the (ill-defined) products of
-functions 
on  Dirac-branes - like  - are ignored. This implies that  
contains at most terms linear in  and that it carries no gravitational 
anomalies. Correspondingly one can see that our action duinv  
(for ) reduces to  - after correcting a factor 1/2 - if 
one neglects all terms of order  
and , and replaces the Chern-kernel  with the -function
on the Dirac-brane .

Concluding remarks and open problems 

There are attempts in the literature to construct low energy effective
actions for -branes (with or without -branes) 
relying on potentials  which are 
ill-defined on the -brane worldvolume;
they are based on Dirac-branes, or something equivalent to them, and 
a consistent treatment of the resulting singularities is still missing 
(Since in the -brane effective action the interaction is cubic 
and since products of -functions do not define distributions 
the authors think that for this case a consistent
treatment can not be achieved.) . 
These approaches refrain, in particular, from specifying the singular 
behaviour of the field strength  near the -brane and they entail 
correspondingly two main drawbacks:
the dynamics i.e. the action - but even the equations of motion - contain 
ill-defined objects, such as the pullback of  or - even worse - 
of  and, moreover, the
(formal) actions which result from these approaches do not cancel the
gravitational anomalies. The Chern-kernel approach solves these
two problems simultaneously.   

In this paper we considered a topologically trivial space-time. 
Nevertheless the Wess-Zumino action



with  given in l12 , should make sense also in a target-space
 with non-trivial topological properties. In such a space-time the 
crucial feature is the dependence of  on the chosen twelve-manifold
 with boundary . In the absence of global  quantum 
anomalies one would require that  is independent of the 
chosen 
 modulo . This would be equivalent to require that


 
with  integer, for a generic closed manifold . However, as shown
in, even  in the absence of - and -branes the 
above integral is in general only an integer multiple of , meaning that
 carries a residual sign-dependence on 
. But in it is 
then also shown that the quantum effective action carries a global anomaly,
due to the fermionic determinant of the Rarita-Schwinger operator, 
which compensates precisely this sign-ambiguity. 

A similar situation is supposed to arise in the presence of -
and -branes. In this case there are additional global quantum
anomalies due to the branes, but one expects again that
the total effective action is well-defined. This conjecture needs still
to be proved, but since the formula l12  is explicit and involves 
only objects with a simple and clear geometrical meaning, we hope to be able
to provide a proof based on that formula.

In the absence of branes the proof of cancellation of global anomalies 
of reference relied on the statement that  
defines a half-integral cohomology class, i.e. .
In presence of an -brane a necessary condition for global anomaly 
cancellation is then that  represents a half-integral
class in the complement of  . We can check here that 
this minimal condition can be easily satisfied in our construction.
The first step concerns the definition of  in terms of the
Chern-kernel . In a topologically non-trivial space-time the 
form  must have the following defining properties: 1) near  it 
behaves as in even  and 2) in the complement of  it amounts
to a closed form. An explicit realization like even  is 
still available  
if there exists a map  from  target-space to , reducing to
normal coordinates in a tubular neighborhood of  and nowhere vanishing
in its complement. Defining 
 we can then introduce a globally defined four-form  
according to even  and write
 coho 
H=H_0+gK,
 where  (locally ) is a half-integral cohomology class,  
, as assumed in in absence of
branes. Using the above
realization for  we can now show that also



Take in each point of target-space an -basis  
normal to , , , 
.
Construct then the -connection and curvature 
, 
. Since one has 

and 
, it is immediately seen that



i.e. one-half of the -Euler-form of the curvature 
(The frames  can not be glued together continuously all over 
the target-space. Even in a space-time with trivial topology they carry 
necessarily a singularity along a seven-manifold  whose boundary
 is . This 
implies that  is singular along  while , being 
-invariant i.e. independent of , is singular only
on . This means that we have  in the complement of ,
while in the whole target-space we have .) .
This implies that  has in general semi-integer integrals over closed 
four-manifolds which do not intersect . However, its integral over a 
four-sphere linking  equals unity, since the Euler-characteristics of a 
four-sphere is two: this reflects clearly the fact that the -brane
carries one unit of magnetic charge. 

Appendices 

Regularizations 

Instead of giving general formulae for the "real algebraic approximation
mode", we present here examples one for an even
and one for an odd current, generalizations being straightforward.

First we approximate our -like currents  with smooth ones
 that preserve -invariance and depend algebraically
on ,  and ; for  and   we have
 J_5^&=&14(2)^3 ^2+y^2 ^a_1a_5 
           Dy^a_1 (F^a_2a_3 F^a_4a_5 +
          43 (^2+y^2) F^a_2a_3 Dy^a_4 Dy^a_5 .


&&14(2)^3 ^2+y^2 ^a_1a_5 
           Dy^a_1  
.+815(^2+y^2)^2 Dy^a_2 Dy^a_3 Dy^a_4 Dy^a_5 
          ),


J_4^&=&18(2)^2            ^2+y^2  ^a_1a_4 (F^a_1a_2 F^a_3a_4 +
           2^2+y^2 F^a_1a_2 
           Dy^a_3 Dy^a_4 .

           &&18(2)^2 ^2+y^2  
           ^a_1a_4  
.+1(^2+y^2)^2  Dy^a_1 Dy^a_2 Dy^a_3 Dy^a_4 ).
 These currents satisfy
 _0 J^&=& J

dJ^&=&0

_M_n J^&=&1, where the last integral is along an -dimensional manifold at
. The currents  enjoy therefore the following
properties: they are closed and
invariant, they entail the same total charge as  and they are regular at
: we have indeed the pullback formulae
 a1 
J^_4_M&=&_4(f)

J^_5_M&=&0, where  for a generic even  is the -Euler-form
on . These formulae represent, in particular, an explicit realization of
the Thom-isomorphism. Regularized Chern-kernels satisfy by
definition



and it is not difficult to find explicit expressions. For the even kernel
one gets
 k4reg 
K_4^14(2)^3 ^a_1a_5 
           ^a_1 (f_1F^a_2a_3 F^a_4a_5 +
         f_2F^a_2a_3 D^a_4 D^a_5 
            +f_3D^a_2 D^a_3 D^a_4 D^a_5 ),
 with
 f_1&=&y 

f_2&=&2(y -y^2+y^2 )

f_3&=& y -y^2+y^2 
          -23 y^3(^2+y^2)^2 ,
and it is straightforward to see that for  one obtains
even  for . For the odd kernel we get instead
 K_3^ where
 _3^12(4)^2 ^a_1a_4 ^a_1 D^a_2 ( g_1 F^a_3a_4 +
g_2D^a_3 D^a_4 ),
 with
 g_1&=&4(y^2+^2  -1)

g_2&=&83 (^3+32 y^2(y^2+^2)^3/2  
-1).
 For   reduces to omega .
The regularized even kernel is invariant, as , and the odd one maintains
the transformation property of  since  is invariant. Both
kernels are regular on  and one gets
 K_3^_M&=&^0_3(a)

K_4^_M&=&0, obviously in agreement with a1 , a2 .

To illustrate the use of these formulae we provide a simple alternative proof
of serve . Considering the limits in the sense of distributions
we can write




where we are allowed to use Leibnitz's rule since  is a regular
distribution. The
first term converges trivially to , while the second term is in the limit
necessarily supported on  (as  only terms with
 contribute, see j5reg ).
This means that



for some form  which is defined on  (Notice that the
existence of the limit  in the
distributional sense ensures the existence of the limit
 in the distributional sense; the same
property does in general not hold in linear spaces of functions, endowed with
stronger topology.) . Moreover, since  as well as  are
-invariant forms, also  must be an invariant form on ;
but since  is an odd form it must necessarily vanish, because
there are no invariant odd forms on , made out of the -connection
.

Similarly one can show that for even kernels the product  is a closed form,




where the last equality follows from k4epull . As above one has
, for some invariant even form
 which must be also odd under parity of the normal bundle 
i.e. proportional to , as is . But since  is odd
no such form exists, and hence .

Existence and construction of the three-form  

We begin giving the explicit expression of the -kernel
 K=14(4)^2 ^a_1a_5 y^a_1 (F^a_2a_3 +D^a_2 D^a_3 )
(F^a_4a_5 +D^a_4 D^a_5 ),
 and recalling the definition of the Euler-form, the
associated Chern-Simons form  and its descent, for a generic -bundle
with connection  and curvature ,
 (T) &=&12(4)^2 ^r_1r_4 
T^r_1r_2 T^r_3r_4 ,

^0(W)&=&12(4)^2 ^r_1r_4 (
W^r_1r_2 dW^r_3r_4 + 23 W^r_1r_2 (
WW)^r_3r_4  ),

^1(W)&=& 12(4)^2 ^r_1r_4 
L^r_1r_2 dW^r_3r_4 ,

 (T)&=&d^0(W), ^0(W)=d^1(W),
  W^rs =DL^rs .
 We are searching for a form  on  such that
 sempre 
KJ_8+12 _b^0J_9=d(XJ_8),
 where  is the Chern-Simons form of the Euler-form,
with -connection  on . Since
, what appears really in this formula is the
pullback of  on , and we will now show that the pullback
form is a closed form, more precisely that
 


where  is the form we are searching for. In  all
objects of k4  are evaluated on . If we parametrize
 by  we get in particular 
, which determines in each point of  a
particular direction. This allows to define on  the reduction
- along  - of the -connection  down to an
-connection . The reduction procedure is
canonical: define on  an -basis  normal to
, ,
 


then the reduced connection and curvature are given by
 


With these definitions it is straightforward to show that one has
the identities
 




Using them in the restriction of k4  to , one sees
immediately that this restriction amounts to the Euler-form of
, apart from a factor 1/2,
 


The three-form  is then simply the Chern-Simons form of ,
  X=12 ^0(W).
 To prove that this  satisfies indeed sempre  it remains
to show that the restriction of  from  to 
coincides with the -connection . This can be
seen as follows.  Since the  are normal coordinates on 
and , we have that the vector 
 coincides with the (normalized) component
normal to , of the unique vector on  which is tangent to
 and normal to . But by definition (see section 5.1)
 is the subgroup of  on  which leaves
 invariant. This means, by construction, that
.

From the explicit construction of  one can deduce its
transformation properties under -transformations and
-transformations respectively, checking thus XQ  and
anoml11 :
  X&=& Q_M_3 +d,

 X&=& 12 d^1(W),
 where  is some two-form on  with  ,
and clearly  .


PST-invariance 

The main work one has to accomplish is to compute the variation of
 under generic variations of the fields , , 
 and . The result can be cast in the form
 S &=&_M_11  [(d(Vf_6)+Vf_3H_4
 -gv(H -W )J_5)(B_3+db)

 &&-d(Vf_3)
 (B_6+12 B_3B_3+g K b)

&&+dCd(g2c c 
 (H -W )(H -W )J_5
 -1CC f_3f_6)C]. To arrive at this formula one has to use decomp  and some
standard relations like  and ; but, most
importantly, one has to use the identity for four-forms
 


which holds  because  is the functional derivative of
the Born-Infeld lagrangian. It is indeed the qualifying property
for all allowed lagrangians, i.e. those which give rise to a
consistent (Lorentz-invariant) dynamics for a (self-interacting)
chiral boson in six dimensions.

The equations of motion for , ,  and  can
be read directly from  and are given respectively by,
  d(Vf_3)&=&0

d(Vf_6)&=&gv(H -W )J_5 -Vf_3H_4

gd(v(H -W ))J_5&=&-d(Vf_3H_4)

dCd(g2c c 
 (H -W )(H -W )J_5
 -1CC f_3f_6)&=&0.
 One sees that the -equation is supported on ,
because the r.h.s. of B  is proportional to , thanks to
A . This is consistent with the fact that the extension
 is a pure gauge degree of freedom. It is also
immediate to see that the -equation is a consequence
of the -equation, and that the -equation is a
consequence of the other three equations.

Eventually, proving invariance of  under the
PST-transformations uno -due  - given the above
form of  - is a simple exercise.
