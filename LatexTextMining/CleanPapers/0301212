Gravity coupled to an arbitrary number of antisymmetric tensors and scalar
fields in arbitrary space-time dimensions is studied in a context of
general, static, spherically symmetric solutions with many orthogonally
intersecting branes.  Neither supersymmetry nor harmonic gauge
is assumed.  It is shown that the system reduces to a Toda-like system
after an adequate redefinition of transverse radial coordinate . 
Duality 
 in the set of solutions is observed.
    



Introduction 

Recently branes are subject of strong interest mainly because of their
crucial role in superstring theories where they can carry Ramond-Ramond
charges. However it is possible to view them from a classical point of
view as solutions of field equations in supergravity or more generally in
systems with gravity coupled to antisymmetric tensors and other fields.
Here we consider static, spherically symmetric solutions (see
 and references therein). Most of solutions of this type were
previously found in so-called harmonic gauge (linearity condition) i.e.
assuming that supersymmetry is not entirely broken. There
were also attempts to relax this condition. In a case
of a system with single scalar and single antisymmetric tensor a complete
solution was presented in. It was also observed that studying
multibrane systems is equivalent to solving a Toda-like system what turned
out to be a very helpful tool in derivation of many classes of exact
solutions ( and references in). Such
equivalence however was proved with a postulate of Poincare invariance 
in all directions parallel to at least one brane or in harmonic
gauge.

In this paper we continue exploring this idea. We consider -dimensional
gravity coupled to several antisymmetric tensors and scalars, assuming
that each antisymmetric tensor supports only one brane.  We do not
postulate Poincare invariance in the whole subspace parallel to at least
one brane, but divide it into several smaller subspaces each uniquely
described as parallel to some of the branes and transversal to the others.
The geometry of each of the subspaces is governed by an independent factor
in the metric tensor. In the directions transversal to all branes
 symmetry is assumed. We show that the classical equations of
motion are equivalent to a Toda-like system after an adequate redefinition
of radial coordinate: , where 
is in general not harmonic. A duality in the set of solutions is observed.
Each solution described by given values of parameters has a partner which
is numerically equal to it if a sign of  is reversed (or
equivalently if ). In particular, the solution dual to
the supersymmetric (harmonic) is not supersymmetric (not harmonic).



The model 

Consider a  dimensional theory having in the classical limit the
following action:

 
_M  d^DX g  ( 
  R - 1 2  _N_  _M 
_^M _  - _i=1 ^N_A  (_N_  
a_i  _) 2n_i! 
  F^i_M_1M_n_i  F^iM_1M_n_i   ), 
 
where  are antisymmetric -forms,  - scalar fields,
 - constants,  - a manifold of dimension  and
 coordinates on it. For example the bosonic sector of most of
supergravity theories is well described by the above action if additional
 assumptions leading to cancellation of Chern-Simons term are made.
The equations of motions derived from () are:

 
R_MN  &=& 1 2  __M __N _
   + _i e^_a_i  _  2(n_i-1)!  
S^i_MN , 
 

   0 &=& _M ( e^_
a_i  _ F^iM R_1R_n_i-1   ), 
 

   _M^M _&=& _i a_i  2n_i !  
e^_a_i  _  
    F^i_R_1 R_n_i   F^iR_1R_n_i  . 
 
with:
 
S^i_MN =F^i_M R_1R_n_i-1   F^i_N  ^R_1R_n_i-1  -
n_i-1 n_i(D-2) F^i_R_1R_n_i   F^iR_1R_n_i  g_MN . 
where  and  are sums over all possible values of
 and .

We search for a solution which allows  orthogonally intersecting
elementary (electric) or solitonic (magnetic) branes, where each  - a
worldvolume of the -th brane is supported by a potential of the
adequate  or . We define indices  running
through the set of all non-empty subsets of , subspaces
of :


.   . 
 (in other words,  with  is a subspace spun by
vectors simultaneously parallel to all  and
transversal to all ) and numbers of
 subspace's dimensions:


d_I=V_I, D_i=V_i=_I:iI d_I,
  D _i = V _i=_I:iI d_I, 
d=V=_I d_I. 
 
For particular brane configurations some of  can be
zero-dimensional. (For example, if  for any , then
.) We introduce also a mapping 
defined by .

Because all the branes are assumed to propagate in time and the solution
is trivial in case  (all fields constant) therefore:


1 d_1,,N_A  D-1, -1 
D-3, 0d_I 
D-2 for  
I 1,,N_A. 
Additionally it is postulated that:

0. 
(This assumption can be omitted if an appropriate limiting procedure 
 is applied.)

We call by  the coordinates on , by 
- the coordinates on , by  - on , by
 - on  and we use sum convention for all indices
enumerating coordinates but not for indices like  or . We introduce
also symbols  and  for any
function .

We assume that all the fields depend nontrivially only on the radial 
coordinate (in the transverse space) . For scalar fields it means:
_(X) = _(r).
Metric tensor is assumed to be divided into  segments related to
 and those  which are at least one-dimensional (
):

 
ds^2(X) = _I e^2A_I(r)  dx^^I  dx^^I  _^I ^I 
  +  e^2B(r)  ( (dr)^2 + r^2 d^2 ),  
where  is the space interval of the  dimensional unit
sphere and  if
. In the formula () and any
formulae below by  we denote a sum over those  for which
 are at least one-dimensional and which satisfy the restriction
.

For the antisymmetric tensor fields , two cases should be distinguished.
If a brane is elementary, the only nonzero components of  have a form:
 
F^i_m ^i_1 ^i_D_i   (X) = _^i_1 
^i_D_i   _m (C_i(r)) 
 
when for a solitonic brane only:

F^i_ ^i_1  ^i_D _i  m_1 m_+1   (X)
  = _ ^i_1  ^i_D _i  m_1 m_+1  n  
_i y_n r^+2   
do not vanish, where  is an arbitrary nonzero real constant.

Now it is possible to rewrite the equations of motion
(-) in terms of the scalar functions , ,
 and (only for the elementary branes)  introduced by
(-): 


A"_I + A'_I ( _J d_J A'_J  + B' + +1 r  ) 
  &=& _iI  _i(S'_i)^2 - _iI  
D_i(S'_i)^2 2(D-2) , 
 

  B" + (B')^2 + 2+1 r B' + (B' + 1 r ) _I d_I A'_I
  &=& - _i D_i(S'_i)^2 2(D-2) ,  

  + ( _I d_I A'_I + 
B' + +1 r  ) 
  &=& -1 2 _i _i a_i  (S'_i)^2, 
 
 
B" - (B')^2 -  r B' + _I d_I 
(A"_I -1 r A'_I-2A'_I B'+ (A'_I)^2 )
  + 1 2 _(&=& 
1 2 _i (S'_i)^2,  

  C"_i + C'_i ( C'_i - _I:iI  d_I A'_I + 
_I:i I  d_I A'_I + B' + 
  _a_i  + +1 r  ) 
&=& 0, 
 
where:

_i &=&    . 

  S'_i &=&    . 
 


Harmonicity, supersymmetry and  coordinate 

Assuming that , define:

= _I d_I A_I + B, 
 
Relation  is usually called linearity condition or harmonic gauge
because it leads to a solution expressed in terms of harmonic functions
on .
In case of supergravity theories it is necessary but not sufficient 
for preserving supersymmetry.
Here we do not make any a priori assumption on , so the results 
presented below remain valid in more general classes of non-supersymmetric 
solutions and solutions not governed by harmonic functions.

Summing (-) one can see that  has to 
satisfy the following equation:

2+1 r = 0, 
which can be solved as:

(r)= c_2  c_ 
+_, 
 
where  is an arbitrary real constant and  takes real 
as well as infinite values. 
Since 
, points 
and  in the parameter space can be identified.
In the discussion below we choose , but it can be 
generalised to arbitrary .

Let us introduce new parameters:  and 
, such that:

s_R^2 =1/c_
(if  or  both possible signs of  describe the same 
point in the parameter space) and define a function:

(r) &=&    . 
 
 where:

(x) =    . 
 
Formula () exhibits the following duality:

(r;R,s_)=-(1/r;1/R,s_), 
 
what gives a relation between  defined for different 
parameter values.
 is equivalent to harmonic gauge and then and only then
 what is 
harmonic function of .
So, the parameter  (or ) can be treated as a measure how distant 
is a given case from the harmonic one.
, is a partner of  under () and then
. 

Function  can be understood as a space coordinate instead of  
and the coordinate change is singular only at , .
The space-time interval expressed in terms of  is:

ds^2()= _I e^2A_I()  dx^^I  dx_^I  + 
 e^2()  ( d^2 + 
 ()^2 d^2 ), 
 
where 

(()) &=& 
( 12 (-_I d_I A_I() +_) )^1/  
  ()^-(1+1/) ,  

  () &=&    . 
 
and for  one has:

(;R,s_)=(-;1/R,s_) 
. 

Note, that () is well defined even for such values of 
 which cannot be related to any  by ().
In other words,  covers wider area of space-time than . 
We discuss some aspects of the fact in the last section of the paper.

The equations (-) can be translated to:

  A _I &=& _iI  _i(S _i)^2 - 
  _iI  D_i(S _i)^2 2(D-2) ,  

   _&=& 
  -1 2 _i _i a_i  (S _i)^2, 
  

  0 &=& S _i + (_a_i   _- 
  _I:iI  d_I A _I )S _i,
  (only elem.)  
   

1   ( _I d_I A _I )^2 + 
_I ( d_I (A _I)^2 ) 
+ 1 2 _( _)^2+_= 
1 2 _i (S _i)^2,  
where:

S _i &=&    . 
 

_&=& -16(+1)c_ (c_
and the "dots" describe derivatives with respect to .

The system (-) together with 
(-) carries complete information originaly
contained in (-, ).
Since (-, ) drastically simplifies when 
harmonic gauge is imposed, it is interesting what
happens to (-, -) 
in analogous situation.
If one treats  as a fundamental coordinate then all dependence 
of the solution on parameter  (so also all differences between the 
harmonic and general cases) enters only in two places.
In  function () which
influences a form of the metric on  and in 
 constant () appearing in ().
However () is not a dynamic equation but rather a constraint 
decreasing by one a number of integration constants.
What is more, if  two different  gives the same value of 
.
In particular, for both  and  one has  and
.



Toda-like system 

Define:

_i = ( 12 __i a_i 
_I:iI  d_I A_I ). 
With these functions one can find that () leads to:


S _i = p_i/_i, 
 
where  are nonzero real integration constants.
Simultaneously () for solitonic branes gives 
,
so, after identification , relation 
() is valid for elementary as well as for solitonic branes.

It can be checked from (-) that  have to 
satisfy the following system of equations: 


d^2 d^2  (_i) = 
- _j _ij  p_j^2 4_j^2 , 
 
where elements of  matrix are:


_ij = 2 D-2  (
_I :i,jI   d_I   
_J :i,jJ   d_J   - 
_I :i I ,j I   d_I   
_J :i J ,j J   d_J    )
+ __i a_i  _j a_j , 
indices  run through all values allowed for  and 
additionally , and by  is understood  
(but not ).
The diagonal elements of  are:


_ii =2 D_i _i D-2  + _a^2_i , 
and the non-diagonal ones are bounded by:


_ij  12 (_ii +_jj ). 
The equations () are equivalent to a Toda-like system.
After substituting  
they transform to:


x _i=-_j K_ij  (x_j). 
 
where .
The original Toda (molecule) system is defined by () with  
being a Cartan matrix.
But in our case  is not in general a Cartan matrix.

If  then it is possible to express all functions
,  (),  (),
 () in terms of :

  (A_I()) &=& E_I ( _i 
_i()^^i_I  ) 
(c_I),  

  (()) &=& E_B ( 
_i _i()^^i_B  ) (c_B) 
   ()^-(1+1/)  , 

  (_()) &=& 
   E_( _i _i()^^i_  
)(c_),  
 

  d d  (C_i())&=& p_i 
_i()^-2 , 
 
where ,  and  have to satisfy:


D-2 2  _i _ij  ^i_I =    .   _i _ij  ^i_= 2 a_j  , 
^i_B = - 1   _I d_I ^i_I 
and values of real constants , ,  and positive constants 
, ,  are restricted by:


.   . 
So, the problem of finding brane solution in gravity coupled to an arbitrary 
number of antisymmetric tensors and scalar fields without assumption of 
harmonic gauge can be reduced to solving a Toda-like system () 
with a condition derived from ():


_i N_i d d (_i) + 12 (_+ 
_c)  = _i p_i^2 4 _i^2 , 
 
where  and  are defined by:
 
_c = _I d_I c_I^2 + c_B^2 + 
12 _c_^2, 
  _j _ij  N_j = d d (_i). 


An example of a solution 

Consider an example when matrix  is diagonal and nonsingular. 
Then () gives:

  _i() =    .  
where real phases  are independent but () gives a 
restriction on :

_i _i _ii   = 12 (_+ _c). 
Substituting () into (-) and 
solving ():

(C_i()) =    . 
 
where  are integration constants, an explicit form of the solution is 
obtained.
If  we recover the solution found in.

Recall also  supergravity elementary-ansatz solution preserving 
supersymmetry.
In this case the space-time interval is:

ds^2 = (1+k r^6 )^-2/3  dx^^1   dx_^1   
 + (1+k r^6 )^1/3 (dr^2+r^2 d^2) 
 
where two assuptions were made.
First, the geometry of the solution tends to flat empty space when 
. 
Second,  to avoid singularity for positive .
Metric tensor coefficients are well defined if , but the solution can 
be extended beyond point  onto area not covered by  coordinate 
.
Rewriting () with  one obtains:

ds^2= (12 k -2/3  
  dx^^1   dx_^1   +
  (6k )^1/3  
 (6)^-7/3 (d^2 + (6)^2 d^2),
 where  and .
Preserving supersymmetry condition is equivalent in this case to  
(harmonic gauge) and .
Flat space condition fixes values of  and .
Positive  from () corresponds to 
 in () and
 coincides with .
One can calculate  finding that it is proportional to 
 and at
 has a nonzero finite value.
This gives a hint that  and  can be 
identified and the extension of the
solution beyond  is described by 
.
At  where  grows to infinity a true 
singularity is located.

Having () one can extend the transformation introduced in 
() onto space of all parameters appearing in the solution:
   
(;  R,s_, p_i, _i, c_I, c_B, c_,E_i,E_I,E_B,
 E_,_i) 

 (-;1/R,s_,-p_i,-_i,-c_I,-c_B,-c_,
 E_i,E_I,E_B,E_,_i) 
   
and check that the transformation is a symmetry of all fields making up 
the solution:  and 
 (-, ).
But  function () is not invariant under ().
This results in particular with fact that the supersymmetric solution 
given by () has a non-supersymmetric partner which can be 
described by the same formula with .



Conclusions 

In this paper we have shown that the system of equations of motions for
gravity coupled to antisymmetric tensors and scalar fields reduces to
Toda-like equations. The assumption of harmonic gauge usually made in
connection with supersymmetry is not needed if an adequate redefinition of
radial coordinate  is done. A duality in the set of solutions
 (or equivalently )
was noticed.

The set of assumptions made in this paper follows the analogous set 
usually made in supergravity: there are several
 scalar and antisymmetric fields coupled to gravity and 
the solutions are not necessarily supersymmetric. 
Under these assumptions the extremely complicated system of equations 
reduces to a well-known Toda-like system.
