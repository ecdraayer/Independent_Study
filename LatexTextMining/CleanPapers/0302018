In this paper a
class of multi-Chern-Simons field theories which
is relevant  to the statistical mechanics of polymer systems is investigated.
Motivated by the problems which one encounters in the treatment of these
theories, a general procedure is presented to eliminate the Chern-Simons
fields from their
action. In this way it has been possible to derive an expression
of the partition function of topologically linked polymers which depends
explicitly on the topological numbers and does not have intractable
nonlocal terms as it happened in previous approaches.
The new formulation of multi-Chern-Simons field theories
is then used to remove and clarify
some inconsistencies and ambiguities which  apparently affect
field theoretical models of
topologically linked polymers.
Finally, the limit of disentangled polymers is discussed.
 
Foreword 
In this paper we study abelian
multi-Chern-Simons field theories

coupled to
charged scalar fields.
Models of this kind find a natural application in the statistical
mechanics of  closed polymer rings
 subjected to topological constraints
and are
relevant in the phenomenology of the fractional quantum
Hall effect.
An important feature of  these theories is that they exhibit
the phenomenon of charge confinement, which
occurs via a topological mechanism explained in
.
The aim of this work is to solve
some problems, discussed below,
which arise in the field theoretical formulation
 of polymer systems.

Let us suppose that there are  polymers with trajectories
 in a dilute solution. The topological state of the system
is specified in such a way that each trajectory  winds up
around trajectory  a number  of times, .
In principle,
it would be desirable to write down an expression of the polymer partition
function which depends on the Gauss linking
 numbers 's. In practice, however, it is only
possible to compute the partition function in the space of the Fourier
conjugated
variables 's.
All attempts to go back to the space of the real topological numbers
 
with
an inverse Fourier transformation led so far to  field theories with
intractable non-local terms.
Even in the investigation of
the simplest case in which all the polymers
are disentangled, i.e.  for , one encounters
tremendous complications, which can be overcome only resorting to mean-field
like approximations.
Moreover, it is also
hard to give a physical meaning to the parameters
 . 
At a first sight, in multi-Chern-Simons polymer models
they play the role of
coupling constants and determine the "strength" of the 
topological interactions which are necessary to keep the polymer trajectories
in the given topological state.
However, 
there is some freedom in the choice of the
domain in which these parameters are defined, so that
this interpretation cannot be correct.
For example, each  can be defined in the interval
, but any other interval of the kind ,
where  is an arbitrary integer, is also allowed due to the properties
of Fourier transformations. Clearly, from the point of
view of field theories, it makes a great difference if  or if
. Furthermore, also the range 
is justified if one starts from a model of open polymers and then
recovers the limit of closed polymers requiring that the ends of the
polymers coincide.


Unfortunately, it is not an easy task
to obtain a reasonably simple expression of the polymer partition
function in terms of the physical parameters  and to remove
the above ambiguities.
One problem is that topological interactions in polymer systems
are governed by
 Chern-Simons fields and the contribution of these fields to the partition
function is hard to evaluate. First of all, it is not possible to proceed
perturbatively, since the values of the "coupling constants" 
are not small. On the other side, the action of Chern-Simons is intrinsecally
defined in three dimensions, so that it is difficult
to exploit techniques like the expansion which require
its
extension to arbitrary dimensions.





Also from the point of view of numerical
 simulations the situation is not better, since
the lattice formulation of Chern-Simons field theories
encountered so far many obstacles.

In order to solve these problems, 
we rewrite the action of
multi-Chern-Simons field theories
with the help of
a Hubbard-Stratonovich
transformation and successively eliminate the Chern-Simons fields.
The resulting field theories
contain only scalar fields and
a set of auxiliary
fields which have no dynamics. 
The procedure used is quite general, although it has been developed
for the special multi-Chern-Simons field theories which are relevant to
polymers.
Exploiting the new formulation of the polymer partition function,
we are able to prove that there are not
ambiguities in the field theoretical description of polymer systems,
because all the possible domains in which the coupling constants

may be
defined lead to equivalent models. Finally,
we clarify the physical meaning of these coupling constants: They play the
role of Lagrange multipliers. The constraints which they impose are explicitly
computed.

The material presented in this paper is divided as follows.
In Section 2 we consider an action with two Chern-Simons
fields coupled with multiplets of charged scalar fields which are 
invariant
under a  group of global symmetry.
The relations of this model with the statistical mechanics of two
topologically linked polymers have been
discussed in details in and
are here only briefly summarized.
Starting from this simple example of
multi-Chern-Simons field theories,
we illustrate the problems which arise in polymer models.
In Section 3 it is shown how it is possible to eliminate
the Chern-Simons fields using a suitable Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation.
In this way we obtain an expression of the partition
function of polymers in terms of the topological numbers 
in which the action is polynomial in the fields. In previous approaches,
instead, the action contained non-polynomial and non-local terms.
In Section 4
we check that the
non-uniqueness  of the domain of integration of the coupling constants
disappears
due to a symmetry which was hidden in the original formulation in terms
of Chern-Simons fields.
Finally, in Sections 5 and 6
these results are generalized to the case of multi-Chern-Simons
field theories describing the statistical mechanics of an arbitrary
number of polymers.


The Two-Polymers Model 
Let us consider the action:
 
In Eq. acttwo   and
the symbols , , denote
multiplets of charged fields:
_i=(_i^1,,_i^n_i )_i^*=(_i^*1 ,,_i^*n_i ) repfie 
In our notations:
 
It is easy to check by rescaling the field 
that the Chern-Simons coupling constant  is irrelevant and that only
the coupling constant  appears in the physical amplitudes of the
theory. 

Field theories such as those of Eq. acttwo  enter in various
physical problems. Here we consider the case of two closed polymers
with trajectories  and  and lengths  and 
respectively.  The
trajectories are
constrained to satisfy the following topological constraint:
(P_1,P_2)=mm=0,1,2 topcond 
where  is the Gauss linking number given by:
(P_1,P_2)=14 _0^L_1 ds_1_0^L_2 ds_2 _1(s_1)[ _2
(s_2)
(_1(s_1)-_2(s_2)) _1(s_1)-_2(s_2)^3 
] glndef 
In the above equation  and  are represented 
by two closed curves , where
 and  are the arc lengths of the trajectories.
In terms of the bond currents
_i()=_0^L_i ds_i_i(s_i)^(3) (curdef 
Eq. glndef  may be rewritten as follows:
m=14 d^3x d^3y_1()[_2()
(currtopcond 
It is possible to show that, in the Lorentz gauge, in which the fields 
and  are completely transverse,
 the partition function of this two-polymer
system coincides with the following amplitude:
Z=
_0^2 d 2  e^-m Z() parfunone 
where
Z()=
D (fields)_1^1()^2_2^1()^2e^-S_2()  
 parfuntwo 
and
D (fields)=D D _i=1 ^2_a_i=1 ^n_i  [D _i^aD _i^*a  ] meas 
To make contact with polymer physics, we should keep in mind that it is
still necessary to continue analytically the partition function
 to the limit of zero replica numbers  and .
Moreover, one should also add to the action acttwo  the so-called
excluded volume interactions, which
take into account the steric repulsions of the monomers.
However, both
 zero replica limit and excluded volume interactions are
 irrelevant in the present context and
will be ignored.

We see from Eq. parfunone  that one has
to consider the sum over the partition functions
 for all values of the coupling constant  in the
interval .
This is a consequence of the fact that
the topological condition topcond  has been imposed by inserting in the
partition function the  of Kronecker ,  which
in the Fourier representation is given by:

_m,(P_1,P_2) =
_0^2 d 2 
e^-(m-(P_1,P_2))  fourep 
This integration over 
is a further complication with respect to standard
field theories, which makes it difficult to study the physical
properties
 of the two-polymer model given above.
For example, let us note that the right
hand side of Eq. fourep  is invariant under
the shifts:
+kk=0,
1,2 lamshi 
Therefore, for consistency,
also the
partition function 
should be invariant as a function of  under these shifts.
However, such invariance is not evident from
Eqs. (-)
and from the action acttwo .
Other difficulties arise
if we wish to describe the behavior of two disentangled
polymer rings starting from the partition function of
Eqs. (-). As a matter of fact,
even in the limit of zero topological number ,
the integration over  remains complicated.
In general, the investigation of the  limit
is  problematic in models of topologically linked polymers 
based on the Edwards approach. The only concrete results
have been achieved up to now
in the case of dense solutions, where mean field-like
approximations are possible.


In principle, one can easily eliminate the coupling constant
 in parfunone  by performing a simple Gaussian
integral, but the new partition function contains non-local
operators whose treatment by analytical methods is difficult
.
On the other side, it is possible to study
the partition function 
by means of  field theoretical techniques.
However, the knowledge of the properties of  does not
provide a very deep insight into
the properties
of the final partition function .
Elimination of the Chern-Simons Fields 
A more transparent formulation of the two-polymer problem, in which
the role of the couplingg constant  is explicit, can be
provided by means of two Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations.
As a first step, let us rewrite the partition function of
Eqs. (-) in the following way:
 
where   represent
two sets of auxiliary complex vector fields and 
are given by:
 

S_1()=
d^3x 
()+d^3x_1+
d^3x_2 suno 
Here we have introduced the vector fields
_i=1_a_i=1 ^n_i [_i^*a_i  _i^a_i 
-_i^a_i  _i^*a_i ] curralg 
which are related to the total matter currents of the replica fields
.
This connection with matter currents becomes more explicit if we
consider the classical equations of motion of the fields
:
 
Substituting Eqs. equmoto  and equmott  in curralg  one
obtains:
 
which are exactly the total abelian matter currents of the replica
fields.

At this point we are ready to show that the partition function
parfunone  and newparfun  are equivalent.
To prove that, it is sufficient to perform in Eq. newparfun  the
change of variables:

_1^a_1 
=_1^a_1 +(a_1 _1^*a_1 
=_1^*
a_1 +(+)_1^* 1  trasimo 
_2^a_2 
=_2^a_2 +(a_2 

_2^*a_2 
=_2^*
a_2 +(+)_2^* 2  trasimt 
After this substitution, the result is exactly the partition function
of Eqs. (-), apart from an irrelevant
constant coming from the Gaussian
integration over the decoupled primed fields 
, , .
Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations of this kind are common in
polymer physics.
They can be rewritten in a more familiar form in
terms of real vector fields, coinciding with the real and imaginary
parts of the fields  and . This point
will be discussed in more details in the Appendix.

It is now easy to integrate out the Chern-Simons field from the
partition function newparfun . To this purpose, we have to
consider the path integral:
Z_  =D D e^-S_1() 
 auxtwofie 
A first integration over the  fields gives:
Z_  =D e^-d^3x_2 
(+_1)
 
abparfun 
The function in Eq. abparfun  enforces the constraint:
+_1=0
 constone 
which implies that the current  is conserved as expected.
As a matter of fact, taking the divergence of both members of
Eq. constone , one obtains: .

Solving the constraint constone  with respect to ,
Eq. abparfun  becomes:
Z_  
=[
-4 d^3xd^3y(1)_1()] abpfsolved 
The substitution of abpfsolved  in the partition function
newparfun  gives the following result:
 
The field integration measure is now:
D (fields)'=
_i=1 ^2_a_i=1 ^n_i 
D _i^a_i 
D _i^*a_i D _i^a_i 
D _i^*a_i 
 phyformea 
The Limit of Disentangled Polymers 
With the new formulation of the partition function given by
Eq. phyforparfun , the role of the parameter  in the
two-polymer model and its invariance under
the shifts 
have become transparent.
As a matter of fact, performing the simple integration over 
one obtains:
 
where the measure  and the action  have been
given in Eqs. phyformea  and szero  respectively.
Clearly, the constraint

4 d^3xd^3y_1()(
_2()1=m connt 
is the analogous of the present field theoretical formalism of the
topological constraint currtopcond . 

In the limit , the
partition function phyforparfun  becomes:
 
From Eq. zmzero  it turns our that topological interactions do
not vanish if  as one could naively expect from the fact that the
polymers are disentangled in this case.
The reason is that the topological interactions are still necessary
when the polymers get too near at some point in order to prevent the
crossing of the trajectories, which would modify the value of .

Eq. phyforparfun  shows also that the form of the
partition function  does
not change under a shift of the coupling constant  of the
kind given in Eq. lamshi .
As a matter of fact, let us perform the shift 
, 
in Eq. parfunone , so that we get the new partition function:

Z_shifted =_k ^(k+1) 
d2 e^-imZ(km _0^2 d 2 e^-m 
Z(+k)
 zshift 
Repeating the same steps which led from Eq. parfunone  to
Eq. phyforparfun , we obtain:
 
The integration over  imposes once again the constraint
connt  in the partition function . As a consequence,
it is easy to show that
Z_shifted =Z zshiide 
for , because of the relation

e^-k 4 d^3xd^3y(1)_1() =e^-k m =(-1)^km  exide 
which is enforced by this constraint.

Thanks to the invariance under the shift lamshi  and
Eq. zshiide ,
we are also able to prove the following identity:
Z_- ^+ d 2  e^-m 
Z()=Z ideimp 
where 
 is  the partition function given above in () and
 is defined in 
Eq. ().
The partition function  differs from  only
by the domain of integration of the parameter ,
which in this case is the real line .
This is what one obtains
if one derives the model of two closed polymers starting from two open
polymers and then requiring that their ends coincide
.

To verify Eq. ideimp , we divide the domain of integration over
 in the infinite number of intervals ,
where  is an integer.
In this way,  becomes of the form:

Z=
_l=- ^+ _2l ^2(l+1) d_l 2 
 e^-m_l Z(_l) ggg 
Since  is an integer, it is also possible to write:

Z=
_l=- ^+ _0
^2 d 2 
 e^-m Z(+2l) hhh 
Using Eq. zshifdwa  and the
constraint connt  it is now easy to show 
that the terms depending on  factorize as follows: 
 
Comparing the above expression with the expression of the partition
function  of Eq. confinpar  it is possible to conclude that
 apart from the infinite constant factor

, which does not change the physics
of the problem.
The -Polymer Model 
In this Section we consider the extension of the two-polymer model
discussed above
to the more realistic case of the fluctuations of  polymers.
Let us denote with  the trajectories of the 
polymers, which  are constrained to satisfy the following relations:
(P_i,P_j)=m_ij 
  multiconst 
These conditions can be enforced in the partition function which
describes
the statistical mechanics of the  polymers by inserting the
following product of Kronecker delta's:

_i=2 ^N_j=1j<1 ^N-1 ((P_i,P_j)-m_ij )=
_i=2 ^N_j=1j<1 ^N-1 _0^2 d
_ij  2  e^-_ij (m_ij -(P_i,P_j))  
fourexp 
where the 's are elements of a  matrix of
Fourier parameters such that  whenever  for
.
The field theoretical version of the polymer model has been
derived in. Its partition function is given by:
Z _N=
_i=2 ^n_j=1j<i ^N-1 d_ij  2 
e^-m_ij _ij   Z _N(_ij ) 
partnpol 
where
Z _N(_ij )=D (_i_i^*)_i=1 ^N
_i^1(^i)^*1 _i(^i)e^-S   partlamnpol 
and the action  is:
S =_i=1 ^N-1 d^3x^i(^i)+_i=1 ^Nd^3x[(_i^2+m_i^2_i^2] actn 
The fields , , represent multiplets of
replica fields:
_i=(_i^1,,_i^n_i )_i=(_i^*1 ,,_i^*n_i ) nmulti 
and the vector fields  are linear combinations of the
Chern-Simons fields :

^i=_j=1 ^i-1 _ij ^j(1-_i1 )+^i_i1  
ciajbj 
Finally,
D (_i_i^*)=_i=1 ^N-1 D ^i
D ^i_j=1 ^N_a_j=1 ^n_j 
D _j^a_j D _j^*a_j  dddfields 
Elimination of the Chern-Simons Fields from the Polymer
Model 
First of all, let us introduce auxiliary complex fields 
, where  and .
In a similar way as we did in the case  in Section 3, it is now
possible to rewrite partition function partnpol  in the following
way:
Z _N(_ij )=D (
_i_i^*_i_i^*)e^-S _0-S _1(_ij )  
zniwithxi 
where:
D (
_i_i^*_i_i^*)=
_i=1 ^N-1 D ^i
D ^i_j=1 ^N_a_j=1 ^n_j 
D _j^a_j D _j^*a_j D _j^a_j D _j^*a_j  nppmeas 
S _0=_i=1 ^N_a_i=1 ^n_i d^3x[
-(_i^*a_i _i^a_i +_i^a_i _i^*a_i )+_i^a_i _i^*a_i ] nszero 

S _1(_ij )=_i=1 ^N-1 d^3x
^i(^i)+_i=1 ^N^i_i nsone 
and
_i=1_a_i=1 ^n[_i^*a_i _i^a_i +
_i^a_i _i^*a_i ] npj 
At this point we are ready to perform the integration over the fields
 in the partition function . To this purpose,
we need to evaluate the path integral:

Z _N =_i=1 ^ND  ^iD ^i
e^-S _i(_ij )  npauxparf 
One finds
after a first integration over the fields 's:

Z _N =_i=1 ^ND ^i
e^-_i=2 ^N_j=1 ^i-1 _ij ^j_i 
_i=1 ^N-1 (^i-_i) auxaftela 
The product of Dirac functions in auxaftela  enforces
the constraints:

^i=_i nncons 
whose solution (in components) is:

A_^i=14 d^3y_ (x-y)^  ,,solnpol 
It is now easy to show that:

Z _N 
=
- 4 _i=2 ^N_j=1 ^i-1 d^3x
d^3y
_ij  _ 
(x-y)^ 
solconn 
Substituting this result in the expression of the partition function
 if Eq. partnpol  one obtains:
 
From the formulation of the partition function  given by
Eq. newnparfun  it turns out that the Fourier variables
 play the role of Lagrange multipliers imposing the
constraints:
m_ij =4 d^3x
d^3y
_ij  _i()[
1nnconnn 
which
are the generalization to the  polymer case  of condition
connt .
Once again, in the limit in which all polymers are disentangled, the
effects of the topological interactions do not disappear.
The invariance of the partition function  with respect to
the shifts:
_ij _ij +k_ij k_ij =0,1,2, nlamshi 
can also be proved using similar methods as those employed in Section 4.
Conclusions 
In this paper we have studied abelian multi-Chern-Simons field theories
coupled with matter fields. The attention has been concentrated to those models
which are relevant to the statistical mechanics of polymers, but some
results are valid for any theory containing Chern-Simons fields.
Motivated by the difficulties
which one encounters when dealing with these theories
due to the presence of
the topological fields and their kinetic terms, 
 we have proposed a procedure to eliminate these fields from the
action.
The advantage is that now
the partition function explicitly
depends on the topological numbers  and the polymer action is 
polynomial in the fields, contrarily to the action derived in
.
The price to be paid is that the new action contains auxiliary
vector fields and has a non-local two-body interaction.

With the help of the new formulation it has been possible to show that
the action actn  
is invariant under the shifts of the coupling
constants  given in
 Eq. nlamshi .
This symmetry,
which was not a priori evident in the action
actn , has been used in order to show
the equivalence of all  models of topologically
linked polymers differing by the range of integration
of the Fourier variables 's, see
Eqs. zshiide  and ideimp .
The generalization of these results to any  starting from
the partition function of Eq. newnparfun  is straightforward.
Finally, it has been clarified that the parameters 's in polymer
models are Lagrange multipliers, which impose the
contraints nnconnn . These conditions represent
 clearly the field theoretical
version of the topological constraints topcond , but are not topological
relations by themselves. This is a natural consequence of the fact that,
in the process of elimination of the Chern-Simons fields,
topological and non-topological terms have been mixed together.


To conclude, we would like to address some problems which are still open.
First of all, experiments suggest that in the presence
of topological constraints there are attractive forces acting on polymers
.
In particular,  there are evidences that
 the strength of these forces increases
with increasing complexity of the topological configuration of the system.
A perturbative calculation at the one-loop approximation confirms the
presence of such forces in the two-polymer model ,
but it is difficult to estimate how their strength depend on  starting
from the partition function confinpar .
Another open question is how the phenomenon of confinement
that is active in multi-Chern-Simons field theories may influence the
statistical behavior of the polymers.


















Appendix A: Hubbard-Stratonovich Transformations 
In deriving Eqs. (-),
as well as Eqs. (-),
 we have used the
generalization to path integral of the following Gaussian integral
formula:
 
In the above equation  are a set of complex
variables and  are
constants. To prove Eq. gauintfor  it is sufficient to perform
the transformation
 
which is the analogous of Eqs. (-).
The Gaussian formula gauintfor  can be brought in an
equivalent form after switching to real components 
and  of  and  respectively:
 
Substituting Eqs. (-) in gauintfor  one obtains
the following Gaussian identity, which is familiar in polymer physics because
it is used to simplify the excluded volume interactions:

_j=1 ^2n [dx_j](-_j=1 ^2n 
x_j^2+2_j=1 ^2n c_jx_j)=
(2)^n(-2_j=1 ^2n c_j^2
