The dualised formulation of the symmetric space sigma model is peformed
 for a general scalar coset  where  is a maximally non-compact 
 group and  it's maximal compact subgroup.By using the twisted self-duality 
 condition the general form of the first-order equations 
 are obtained.The results are applied to the example of  / 
 scalar manifold of the IIB supergravity.





Introduction 

In supergravity theories which possess scalar fields the global symmetries of the
 scalar sector are essential to have a deeper understanding of these theories.The scalar
 Lagrangians can be formulated as coset sigma models which are non-linear realisations.
The dimension of the coset space is equal to the number of the scalars of the theory
 When we use the Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction for D=11 supergravity 
[1] and obtain the lower dimensional 
 maximal supergravity theories the global (rigid) symmetry group 
 (i.e.a real Lie group) of the Bosonic sector of the reduced Lagrangians
 are in split real form (maximally non-compact whose Cartan subalgebras
 can be chosen along the non-compact directions).This global symmetry is also the 
 global symmetry of the scalars of the theory.The scalar coset can be constructed as 
 -valued fields where  is the global symmetry group in split real form and 
  it's maximal compact subgroup.The scalars transform non-linearly in the linear representations 
 of  while the higher rank potentials always transform linearly.Although the global 
 symmetry scheme of the supergravity theories are consequences of 
 supersymmetry the study of the coset symmetries of the supergravity theories provides a better
 understanding of the underlying structure of these theories [2,3].

 The method of non-linear realisations [4,5,6,7,8] is used in [9,10]
 to formulate the gravity as a non-linear realisation in which the gravity
 and the gauge fields appear on equal footing.Recently this formulation 
 is enlarged to have a detailed treatment of the maximal supergravity theories.

 By introducing auxilary fields for a subset of the field content and
 by using the coset formulation the global symmetries of the scalar sectors
 of maximal supergravities are studied in [11].These symmetries 
 which are realised on the Bosonic fields are also studied in a general
 formalism in [12].However the complete coset realisation of the scalars
 and the gauge fields is introduced in [13] where the twisted self-duality
 structure of supergravities [14,15] is generalised to regain the first-order equations 
 of the theory from the Cartan forms of the dualised coset.The spacetime symmetries
 turn out to be internal symmetries after the Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction
 in [11].It is shown that these symmetries become gauge symmetries
 after dualisation.The discussion about the symmetry groups of the Cartan forms (the
 doubled field strengths) of the coset formulation 
as well as the symmetry groups of 
 the twisted self-duality equation (i.e.first-order equations) which are 
 larger than the symmetry groups of the Cartan forms is given in [11] and [13]
.In [13] for IIB theory [16]
 it is also shown that the the global symmetry of the twisted self-duality equation of the 
 Cartan form of the coset realisation is the original global symmetry.The same result
 is proved to exist for the dualisation of the scalar sectors of maximal supergravities
 in all dimensions and it is conjectured that the global symmetry is preserved for 
 the full dualisation of these theories.

In [17] the complete non-linear realisation of the D=11 and IIA [18,19,20] supergravity 
 theories is performed for the entire Bosonic sector including the gravity which is 
missing in [13].The symmetries are also discussed in detail in [17].In [21] the 
Bosonic sector of IIB is derived as a non-linear realisation.The non-linear 
realisations of D=11 supergravity and IIA supergravity lead to finite dimensional Lie 
algebras  and  respectively which are not Kac-Moody algebras.
The local subgroups are also chosen to be the Lorentz group so that the general coset
representative of the entire Bosonic sector can not be parametrised by a Borel
 subgroup of some larger group .These coset formulations are not like the 
ones for maximal supergravities which all give rise to Kac-Moody algebras and whose
general coset representatives can be parametrised by a Borel subgroup of a 
larger group.In [21,22] it is discussed that the non-linear realisations
of D=11 and IIA supergravities can be enlarged to include a Kac-Moody algebra
identified as  which contains the Borel subalgebra of .This can be 
done either by introducing a larger local subgroup than the Lorentz group 
or by describing the gravity by two fields which are duals of each other.Furhermore
in [21] the IIB theory is formulated as a non-linear realisation of an infinite dimensional
algebra  which is the closure of the conformal algebra.It is also shown that 
the non-linear realisation can be enlarged to include the Kac-Moody algebra 
 of IIA and D=11 supergravities.

In this note we will give the dualisation of the general symmetric space coset sigma model
 whose global (rigid) symmetry group is in split real form.The scalar sectors of the maximal
 supergravity theories are in this category and in [11] and [13] the scalar sectors are formulated 
case by case with in the context of the dualisation of the Bosonic sectors of these theories.
The formulation presented here assumes a formal construction based on general structure
constants and it is performed for a general  scalar manifold ( is a 
maximally non-compact group and  is it's maximal compact subgroup).The formulation 
is based on the Borel gauge as proposed in [11,13] where the maximal supergravities with 
D are based on a coset representative in which the axions 
appear as various exponential factors.A transformation of the fields is needed
to relate the formulation given here and the one in [11] and [13] for D.On the other 
hand for IIB and IIA we have the exact match of the form of the coset representative
chosen (IIA does not contain axions at all).Among the three possible formulations 
of the symmetric space sigma model [11] we will follow the one which 
defines an internal metric that is used instead of the coset element.
Although the general form of the coset Lagrangian is given in [13]
the explicit general dualised formulation is not performed.This work completes
the missing general formulation by  presenting the dualisation of the general coset  by means of the abstract structure constants.It 
also contains the first-order formulation of the equations of motion as a twisted
 self-duality condition for the symmetric space coset sigma model with the global
symmetry group in split real form.

We will start with the derivation of the second-order equations of
motion of the  scalar coset manifold in section two.In section three we will calculate 
the general structure constants of the dualised algebra in terms of the ones of the
 originally assumed Borel subalgebra by introducing the dual fields and the dual generators.In section four the doubled field strength  will be 
calculated and the first-order equations
will be derived by using the twisted self-duality equation  
 (which is an exact self-duality condition since  in our case).Finally we will give an application of the results we derive for the example
of  / scalar manifold in section five.
 






The General Scalar Coset Sigma Model 



In this section we will derive the equations of motion for the scalar coset
after we  introduce the Lagrangian.The formulation is parallel with the one
in [23].The equations are second-order and the dualisation will enable us to
obtain the first-order equations of motion.Let  be a maximally
non-compact (split) group and  it's maximal compact subgroup.One can
consider the -valued scalar fields over the D-dimensional spacetime to
form the scalar manifold first and then demand the local  invariance.This
will reduce the degrees of freedom and the physical scalar manifold elements
will be the  coset-valued fields.The coset representatives can be
parametrised by the Borel subgroup elements.The Borel subgroup is generated
by the Borel subalgebra whose generators are the Cartan generators 
 of the Cartan subalgebra and the positive root
generators  of the Lie algebra of So
the -valued field  can be written as


 


In this so-called Borel gauge the fields  which couple to 
 are called the dilatons and the fields  which couple
to the positive root generators  are called the axions.Totally
there are  scalar fields which generate the valued fields 
 of the scalar manifold.

One can parametrise the positive root part of  in various ways.For example like in [11,13] the positive root part in (2.1) can be constructed
as products of exponentials of individual positive root generators multiplied with the 
corresponding axions.The factors are ordered in a special way so that the axions 
chosen are the same fields which appear in the particular form of the Lagrangians used.
The Campbell-Hausdorff formula can be used to relate the field content (dilatons and axions)
of the different parametrisations of .Indeed each parametrisation corresponds to a
transformation of the scalar fields but we should also bear in mind that the Borel gauge
of the coset does not change as in all of the parametrisations mentioned above the  coset
is still parametrised by the Borel subgroup.

If we define the right,rigid  action of the group  over the valued
fields as  for  we see that 
 is not in the Borel gauge .We should introduce another
transformation which would map it into the range of the Borel gauge
again.The Iwasawa decomposion [24] is the tool for this.It assures that any
group element   which is in the range of the exponential
map can uniquely be expressed as



 

where  while  and  are
the group elements obtained by the exponentiation of the Cartan subalgebra
and the positive root part of the Lie algebra of  respectively.Thus if we
use this result for  we have 
 where 
 is in the Borel gauge.Consequently for each rigid
transformation  there exists a local transformation 
 which enables the map

 


to be closed over the range of the Borel gauge.The general scalar coset
Lagrangian is given as [11,13,23]

 

Here the internal metric  is  where (  ) is the generalised
transpose.In order to define it we first introduce 
namely the Cartan involution which acts on  the Lie algebra of It
reverses the sign of the non-compact generators while leaving the compact
generators unchanged.In terms of the basis we use

 

where  are the negative root generators.For any real group the
compact generators can be written as ( and the
non-compact ones as (For a Lie algebra element 
 the general transpose  is defined as (
As mentioned in [23] it is possible to find a
higher dimensional representation of the Lie algebra in which  coincides
with the matrix transpose operator.For this reason one can define a
conjugate  map over the group  as (exp exp(
If the subgroup of  generated by the compact
generators is an orthogonal group then in the fundamental
representation the generators
can be chosen such that i.e..If it is a unitary group then 
Therefore the generalized transpose of the coset
representative is defined as follows

 

The Iwasawa decomposition assures that the Lagrangian (2.4) is invariant
under the rigid transformations of  which we have defined before.As
discussed in [13] the transformation acting on the general Noether currents
generated by the rigid (non-coordinate dependent) right action of  on the
scalar coset manifold is linear.Since the number of currents exceeds the
total number of scalars (dilatons and axions) of the theory these currents
are not all independent.Therefore the Borel currents corresponding to the
symmetries generated by the Borel subalgebra transform non-linearly under
the action of This may be phrased as the non-linear realisation of the
global symmetry group  over the scalars.

By using  and the
properties of the generalized transpose  also the fact that the
cyclic permutations are permissable under the trace the scalar
coset Lagrangian can be expressed as


 

As mentioned in section one the scalar coset manifolds of the maximal supergravity
theories can be given as  , being a maximally non-compact group and  it's 
maximal compact subgroup.For D=11 supergravity the global symmetry group
 is the trivial group,for IIB  is
  and  is ,for IIA  is 
 and  is the trivial group.The D=9 maximal supergravity has the scalar coset
 /.Exceptional groups  arise  as the global symmetry groups
for  maximal 
supergravities.The details of the maximal compact subgroups of these theories
 can be found in [24].   
 

The 1-form  is the pullback of a Lie
algebra valued 1-form on  through the map For this reason it can
be expressed in the Borel subalgebra basis

 

Now in order to simplify the first term we will use the formula

 

Therefore we have

 

where we have used the fact that The other commutation
relations of the Borel subalgebra are 
 and 
By using the above expansion for  we can also calculate 

 

In the compact form on the right hand side of the last line 
 is the row vector of the
positive root generators;  and 
 is the column vector of the 1-forms 
The matrix  is a series which arises from
the infinite sum given above

 

 is an  matrix  being the number of the positive
roots and it is composed of the axions coupled to the structure constants 
In
this definition we have introduced [
In other words 
 if in the root sense 
 and  if 
 again in the root sense.Now if we use the
Campbell-Hausdorff formula

 

we can explicitly write the second term in (2.8) as

 

The primed row vector  is
defined as 
Finally we can now write  expanded in the
Borel subalgebra generators

 

We have also introduced the vector 
We will express the equations of motion in
terms of If we use 
(2.15) in (2.7) we find that

 

By following the outline of [23] one can derive the equations of motion of
the general scalar coset Lagrangian.We should first observe that 

If (2.15) is substituted into this equation one gets the Bianchi
identity for 

 

If  are considered as independent fields and if we propose the
Bianchi identity as a constraint equation the Lagrange multipliers ( 
-forms) can be introduced and the additional Lagrangian corresponding
to the Bianchi identity can be given as

 

The new Lagrangian becomes 
The variation with respect to  for 
 will give back the Bianchi identities.If we vary 
 with respect to  and then take the exterior
derivative of the resulting field equation we achieve the second-order
equations of motion for 

 

By varying (2.16) with respect to the dilatons  (since 
 does not depend on ) we can also find the equations of motion
for 

 

The details of the formulation given above can be found in [23].As we will
see in the next section in order to formulate the dualised theory we need to
use a slightly different form of (2.19) namely

 

The second-order equations (2.20) and (2.21) are the ones which we will
refer to derive the commutation relations of the dualised generators when we
construct the doubled field strength  which will give the
correct first-order equations by satisfying a twisted self-duality condition.

Dualisation 

If we double the number of the fields by introducing a -form for
each scalar field we can construct a doubled field strength 
which is Lie superalgebra valued [11,13].This algebra is generated by the
Borel generators and the generators we introduce for each dual 
)-form whose commutation relations we will calculate.As we will see
the choice of the appropriate structure constants will be based on the formulation which will give the correct equations of motion.The doubled field strength  is invariant under the Borel
subgroup  of  which corresponds to the rigid symmetries of the
constant shifts of the dilatons and the axions and  is also invariant under the
local gauge symmetries which are generated by the generators coupled to the
dual -forms as discussed in [13].For the doubled field content we
propose the map  as

 

The doubled field strength  is defined as 
In [11] and [13] the twisted self-duality condition is applied
on  to regain the first-order equations of the maximal
supergravity theories.The twisted self-duality condition which is imposed on
 is Here  is a
pseudo-involution of the proposed Lie superalgebra (which is generated by
the original Borel generators and their duals).It's action on the scalar and
dual generators is as follows

 
S H_i =H _i ,S E_m =
E _m , 



S H _i =H_i ,S 
E _m =E_m .

In general  sends the Borel generators to their duals and the
dual ones to their Borel counterparts with a sign factor which is 
where  is the degree of the corresponding field strength
which the generator is coupled to and  is the signature of the spacetime
metric.In fact the eigenvalues of  must be the same with
the eigenvalues of  operator acting on the field
strength coupled to the dual generator which  acts on.For
the present case the field strengths are -forms so  and
the signature of the spacetime is assumed to be So the sign factor
is  

The Borel generators satisfy the commutation relations given in the previous
section and as mentioned in [13] the general form of the remaining
commutation relations of the newly constructed algebra are

 
[E_ ,T _m ]=f _m ^n T 
_n , [H_i ,T _m ]=g _im ^n 
T _n ,



[T _m ,T _n ]=0

where  for  and 
 for In the next
section we will calculate the doubled field strength 
 explicitly but the following formulation will
make use of an alternative method introduced and used in [13].We will define
a the field strength  as 
By using (2.15)

 

From it's definition  trivially satisfies the twisted
self-duality condition 
Since   
 satisfies the Cartan-Maurer equation 
As a matter of fact  is
nothing but  in which the self-duality condition 
 is used for this reason  also satisfies the
Cartan-Maurer equation

 

This equation gives the original second-order equations of the coset
Lagrangian.Therefore one way of obtaining the structure constants in (3.3)
is to calculate (3.5) by substituting (3.4) and to compare the result with
the second-order equations (2.20) and (2.21).

We will use this fact to read the structure constants in (3.3) in terms of
the information of the Borel subalgebra of We should bear in mind that
the generators  and  are of even degree and the ones 
 and  are of even or odd degree
whether their corresponding potentials -forms are even or odd rank
depending on the spacetime dimension.In the exterior algebra of the Lie
superalgebra valued forms even or odd generators behave like even or odd
degree forms when commuting with the differential forms.Also if  is an
odd generator  and if it is even Now by using
(3.4) if we calculate d
 and equate it to zero we find that

 

We have to equate the coefficients of the linearly independent algebra
generators to zero and the resulting equations must be the same with the
second-order equations of motion (2.20) and (2.21).Direct comparison gives
the commutation relations as

 
[H_j ,H _i ]=0,[E_ ,
H _j ]=0,



[H_j ,E _ ]=-_j E _ ,[
E_ ,E _ ]=1 4 l i=1 
  _i H _i ,



[E_ ,E _ ]=N_,- E 
_ ,-=-,.

The conditions in the last line must be understood in the root sense.We can
now express the structure constants  and 
 by using the results we have found

 
f _m ^n =0,ml,f _,+l ^i =1 4 _i ,
il



f _,+l ^i =0,i>l,f _,+l ^i =0,il,




f _,+l ^+l =N_,- ,-=-



f _,+l ^+l =0,--,.

The conditions on the indices  and  are in the root sense.Also we have

 
g _im ^n =0,ml,
g _im ^n =0,m>l,mn



g _i ^ =-_i ,>l.

The First-Order Equations of Motion 

Now that we have obtained the complete commutation relations of the dualised
algebra we can explicitly calculate the doubled field strength in terms of
the structure constants and then use the twisted self-duality equation 
 to reach the first-order equations of motion.We should make
the remark that although the symmetry group of  is composed of
the Borel subgroup  and the local gauge symmetries of the dual
generators the symmetry group which leaves the first-order equations 
 is larger than that.The reason for this is that there could
be symmetry transformations which may change  but still leave
the twisted self-duality condition invariant.By using (3.1) we have

 

 Now by using the equation (2.9) and the fact that [

we obtain

 

 So the field strength becomes

 

where we have defined the vector  as
 for  and 
 for If we use the
Campbell-Hausdorff formula (2.13) twice we can calculate the second term in
(4.3)

 

We have defined the row vector 
 in section three and the matrix  is defined
as Now applying
the Campbell-Hausdorff formula (2.13) once more

 

where we have defined the matrix  as 
.We can now write the
doubled field strength 


 


As we have expressed  in the basis 
 finally we can find the first
order equations of the scalar Lagrangian (2.7) by using the twisted self-
duality equation  .If we substitute (4.6) into this
equation we can read the first-order equations for the dilatons and the
axions in terms of the dual -form field strengths.So the first-order
equations are obtained by equating the coefficients of the  same generators on opposite sides of the equation 
 and in compact form they can be written as

 

In this vector equation the column vector 
 is defined as  for 
 and 
 for  where
 is the  matrix defined in the second
section.This concludes our formulation next we will give an application of
the results we have obtained for the  coset.

The  / Scalar Coset 

The  / scalar coset Lagrangians arise when the
Kaluza-Klein reduction is applied over Tori.For example when the pure
gravity in D+2 dimensions is reduced to D dimensions over the 2-Torus T
the  global symmetry of the reduced scalar Lagrangian becomes 
.The Scalar coset manifold of IIB supergravity
also appears as  /.The dualisation of 
the   / coset
is studied in [11,13].We will derive the same results by using
the general formulation we have developed.The Lie algebra of 
 namely  is isomorphic to  and it has three generators  so
it's Cartan subalgebras are one dimensional and there is one positive root
and one negative root.Therefore the Borel subalgebra is generated by 
 and they satisfy the commutation relation [
denoting For  one can chose the following
representation

 


So that we can calculate  as

 

Also since for  the generalized transpose is
simply the matrix transpose

 

Now from (2.4) we have the Lagrangian

 

We only have one positive root so , 
 and from (2.12) If we use these results in
(2.15) we have

 

This could directly be calculated from (5.2).Since 
and  from (2.19) and (2.20) we have the second-order equations of
motion

 

By using (3.7) the commutation relations for the dual generators can be found as

 
[H,H ]=[E_+ ,H ]=0,



[H,E _+ ]=-2E _+ , [E_+ ,
E _+ ]=1 2 H .

We can now calculate the first-order equations from (4.7).We should first
observe that if we use the commutation relations (5.7) in (3.8) and (3.9) or
directly in (3.3) we find that

 
f _11 ^1 =f _11 ^2 =f _12 ^2 =0,f _12 ^1 =1 2 ,



g _11 ^1 =g _11 ^2 =g _12 ^1 =0,
g _12 ^2 =-2.


In order to calculate the first-order equations we will first calculate the exponentials in (4.7).Since 
 and 
 we have the  and
 matrices as

 


When we exponentiate these matrices and multiply the results we get


 
e^  =(
 
),e^  =(
 
) ,



e^  e^  =(
 
) .


The vectors in (4.7) are calculated from their definitions given in section
three and section four and by using (5.8)

 


When we substitute these results in the equation (4.7)

 

from which we read the first-order equations of motion for the 
 / coset as

 

These first-order equations are the same equations with the ones in [13]
which are obtained by directly integrating the second-order equations (5.6).

Conclusion 
We have derived the second-order equations of motion for a general scalar coset
sigma model.By following the framework of [13] the general form of the structure constants and the first-order equations are derived for the doubled field strength
formalism.We have shown that these general formulas lead to the correct 
results for the case of  /.

We have started from any given coset  and derived the dualised formulation
as well as the first-order  equations in terms of the given knowledge of the
original global symmetry group of the scalar Lagrangian.The results achieved 
in this work are applicable to the scalar sectors of the 
maximal supergravities but as they are derived for a general symmetric space 
sigma model with the abstract notion of the structure constants 
they would dualise and construct the first-order formulation of any other 
theory which assumes the same form.Especially the non-linear 
realisations of the supergravity theories in various dimensions in which 
there is matter coupling would include the scalar formalism introduced here.
The dualisation of the scalar sector is a primary task and a good starting point
for the non-linear realisation of any supergravity theory since it contains the
knowledge of the global symmetry group of the Bosonic sector of the theory.This work
in the most general sense relates the structure of the original scalar coset and the symmetry
group of the doubled field strength from which the first-order equations are derived. 


In spite of the fact that we have given the formulation of the coset
sigma models for the maximally non-compact global symmetry group 
a similar formulation can be performed for the general case of non-compact groups but in that 
case the role of the Borel subgroup must be replaced
by the solvable subgroup.The formulation of the non-linear sigma models and 
in general the principle sigma models would follow the same pattern presented here.
