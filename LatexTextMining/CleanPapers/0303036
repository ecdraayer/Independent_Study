Abstract    
 [.2in]

Higher spin tensor gauge fields have natural gauge-invariant field equations
written in terms of generalised curvatures, but these are typically of
higher than second order in derivatives.
We construct geometric second order field equations and actions for
general higher spin boson fields, and  first order ones for
fermions, which are non-local but
which become local on gauge-fixing, or on introducing auxiliary fields.
This generalises the results of Francia and  Sagnotti to all
representations of the Lorentz group.

Introduction 


Fields in higher spin representations of the Lorentz group arise in
a variety of contexts. In perturbative string theory
they are present in the spectrum of massive modes, and limits in which an infinite number of these become massless are of considerable interest, as they could lead to symmetric phases of string theory with an infinite-dimensional unbroken symmetry group. Interacting theories 
with infinite numbers of massless  higher spin fields with anti-de Sitter vacua have
been constructed in  ,  , but so far these 
have only been constructed in anti-de Sitter spaces of   dimensions , and in
certain generalised spacetimes.
These are associated with higher spin algebras, and higher
spin superalgebras 
  have recently been constructed in dimensions   . 
The free covariant field theories for higher spin gauge fields
have been discussed in  ,  ,  ,  . Tensor gauge fields in unusual representations of the
Lorentz group are also an inevitable consequence of dualising certain
conventional gauge theories. This was analysed in  ,
where the dual forms of linearised gravity were found in arbitrary
dimensions and duality was discussed for general tensor fields.


Recently, there has been considerable progress in the understanding of
free higher spin massless gauge fields. In  ,
 , covariant local free field equations and
gauge-invariant actions were given for gauge fields in  dimensions
transforming in any representation of . The field
equations were given in terms of field strengths so that they were
manifestly invariant under higher spin gauge transformations. However,
these field equations in general involved more than two derivatives of
the gauge field. (The field equations were second order only for those
gauge fields in representations corresponding to Young tableaux with no
more than two columns.) In  , second order field
equations were considered for gauge fields in completely symmetric
tensor representations.
On fixing some of the symmetries, these reduced to the local second
order field equations of Fronsdal  . However, the covariant form
of the field equations of   were written in terms of
invariant field strengths and were non-local, involving inverse
D' Alembertian operators. These non-localities can be removed, however,
by gauge-fixing, or by introducing auxiliary compensator
fields. The purpose of this note is to write down geometric second
order field equations for all representations by combining the two
approaches. The idea is simple; consider one of the geometric higher
derivative field equations in  dimensions of  ,
 , which is of order  in derivatives. The free
field equation is the vanishing of a higher spin generalisation of the
Einstein tensor, , where  involves  partial derivatives of
the gauge field . In a physical gauge (i.e. a transverse
traceless gauge) this reduces to  where 
. Then a suitable second order field equation
generalising that of   is ,
and in physical gauge this reduces to , as it should. This means
that the apparent non-locality of the equation can be eliminated by a suitable
gauge choice, as in  , and it can also be eliminated by
introducing auxiliary fields  . An analogous procedure, again
based on  , is presented for obtaining first
order field equations for spinor-valued fermionic fields in any
representation of the Lorentz group.

Consider for example  a fourth rank totally symmetric tensor gauge field
 represented by  
the Young tableau

    

which has the  gauge
transformation



A_   = 4  _(  _) 

with totally symmetric tensor gauge parameter . The
gauge-invariant field strength is



F__1 _2_1_2_1_2 _1 _2   =
__1 __1 __1 __1  A__2_2_2 _2  
- (_1 _2)  - ...

which is antisymmetrised on each index pair, so that



F__1 _2_1_2_1_2 _1 _2   = F_[_1
_2][_1_2][_1_2][ _1 _2] 

This is the natural generalisation of the linearised Riemann tensor and is represented by the Young tableau

    

. If
the free field equation is to come from varying a gauge-invariant
action with respect to , it should be of the form
 for some gauge-invariant, totally
symmetric tensor , which is the
generalisation of the Ricci tensor. The natural choice is to define



G__1_1_1 _1   := ^_2_2 ^_2 _2 F__1_2_1_2_1_2 _1 _2 

Then  is a covariant local field
equation, but is fourth order in derivatives.

(The field equation  (without
symmetrisation) is also gauge-invariant but cannot be derived from a
gauge-invariant action without introducing extra fields.) 

Here  is the background -invariant
Minkowski metric, which is used to raise and lower indices. The second
order field equation of   is then given by



G  _   := 1   G_(
)   = 0

In the tranverse traceless gauge (which we will refer to as the physical
gauge')
 


^A_   = 0,^ A_   = 0

the equation ( ) reduces to , as
required (see Appendix A for a discusssion of going to transverse traceless
gauge).

The generalised Einstein tensor is



E_   := G_( )  -  _(  
G_)    ^  + 1 4   _( 
 _)   G_    ^   ^ 

which satisfies the conservation equation



 ^  E_    0

identically. Then the action



S  ^[1,1,1,1] _(1)   = -124  d^D x 
A^  1  E_ 

is invariant under the gauge transformation ( ) and its
variation gives the field equation , which is equivalent to ( ). This is a simple
modification of the action  for a type
 tensor gauge field given in  ,
 , obtained by inserting the non-local operator
.

The generalisation to totally symmetric tensors 
of spin- is straightforward  . There is a field
strength



F_ ^1 _1   ^1 _2   ^2 _1   ^2 _2  ...
 ^s _1   ^s _2   = _ ^1 _1 
_ ^2 _1  ... _ ^s _1  A_ ^1 _2   ^2 _2
 ...  ^s _2   - (  ^1 _1  ^1 _2
)  - ...

which is antisymmetrised on each of the  index pairs so that



F_ ^1 _1   ^1 _2   ^2 _1   ^2 _2  ...
 ^s _1   ^s _2   =  F_[  ^1 _1   ^1 _2
] [  ^2 _1   ^2 _2 ] ...  [  ^s _1 
 ^s _2 ] 

If  is even, then contracting 
 over
  pairs of indices with  metric tensors 
 defines the gauge-invariant tensor
. A generalised Ricci tensor 
 is then defined by total symmetrisation of all  indices and
 is a covariant field equation of order 
in derivatives. This is the  derivative field equation of
 ,   for an even spin- field. The
associated second order field equation of   is



G  __1 ... _s   :=  1 ^ r   G_(
_1 ... _s )   = 0

where , and reduces to the Fronsdal equations
  on partial gauge fixing to traceless gauge
transformations  . These Fronsdal equations then
reduce further to  on imposing   the
physical gauge conditions   and
. This equation can be derived from a gauge-invariant non-local action of
the form



S  ^[1,...,1] _(r)   = - 1 s!  d^D x
A^_1 ... _s  1 ^ r   E__1 ... _s 

where  and  is the generalised
Einstein tensor given by shifting the traces of 
and Young symmetrising indices so that 
 identically. The   construction of such Einstein tensors' is discussed in   Appendix B.

For odd spins, we define a rank  tensor
 by contracting over  pairs of
indices of 
. Then
the field equation  of  ,
  is of order  in derivatives, and the second
order field equation of   is as in ( ),
but with . This equation follows from a
gauge-invariant action of the form ( ), but with 
. The gauge-invariant tensor  is again
defined by shifting the traces of  and
symmetrising. In both even and odd spin cases,
the physical gauge field equation  follows
from the     local action



S  ^[1,...,1] _(r)   = - 1 s!  d^D x
A^_1 ... _s   A__1 ... _s 


This generalises to gauge fields in arbitrary  representations of the
general linear group . Consider for example the
Young tableau

    

corresponding to a tensor gauge field 
satisfying



A__1 _2   = A_[_1 _2] , A_[_1 _2]   = 0 ,A__1 _2  
= A__1 _2 () 

We refer to this Young tableau as type , where the numbers
denote the length of the columns. The field strength is



F__1 _2 _3 _1_2_1_2 _1 _2   =
__1 __1 __1 __1 
A__2_3_2_2 _2   - ( _1 _2) 
- ...

which is antisymmetrised on each of the four index types so that



F__1 _2_3_1_2_1_2 _1 _2   =
F_[_1_2_3][_1_2][_1_2][ _1 _2 ] 

and is in a representation that corresponds to the Young tableau

    

of type . Again, one can define a gauge-invariant tensor by



G__1_2_1_1_1   :=  ^_3_2 
^_2_2  F__1_2_3_1_2_1_2 _1 _2 

This tensor is not irreducible under  but an
associated Young tableau can be defined by the Young projection
 of ( ) onto the irreducible
subspace of type  tensors. This projected tensor corresponds
to the generalised Ricci tensor and  


 is a covariant local fourth order
field equation, while  
 is the natural
candidate for a second order field equation. Again, an Einstein-type
tensor  of type  can be
defined by shifting traces followed by Young projection of
 (see Appendix B), so that the second order field
equation above can be derived from the gauge-invariant action



S  ^[2,1,1,1] _(1)   =  -1 12  d^D x
A^_1_2_1_1_1  1  
E__1_2_1_1_1 

The non-local field equations reduce to 
 
in the physical gauge



^_1  A__1_2_1_1_1   = 0 ,
^_1  A__1_2_1_1_1   = 0 , ^_1 _1  A__1_2_1_1_1   = 0

and this field equation follows from the
  local   action



S  ^[2,1,1,1] _(1)   =  -1 12  d^D x
A^_1_2_1_1_1   A__1_2_1_1_1 


The procedure described above generalises to arbitrary tensor gauge
fields  of type  represented by a Young tableau
with  columns, each of length . The field strength  is given
by acting with  derivatives on  and projecting onto the
representation , so that in particular there is
an antisymmetrization on the indices in each column. A generalised
Ricci tensor of type  is obtained by first taking
 traces of  if  is even, or by taking an extra derivative and
taking  traces of  if  is odd. By summing over all
possible inequivalent ways of taking these traces one obtains the
generalised Ricci tensor whose vanishing defines the higher order field
equation in  ,  . An associated
second order field equation is obtained by dividing the higher order
equation above by a suitable power  of the D' Alembertian operator.
This power is  for even  or  for odd . The
non-local gauge-invariant action from which these equations derive
takes the form  in
terms of the type  generalised Einstein tensor .
This non-local action is then replaced by
the local form 
 to derive the field equation  in an appropriate physical gauge.

Clearly, some care is needed in dealing with the index structure in
such exotic representations and in making the above prescription
precise. For -form gauge fields, i.e. gauge fields of type 
with a tableau comprising a single column of length , differential
forms provide the natural formalism to describe the theory. For ,
the generalisation to multi-forms' provides the natural formalism
to describe the theory. In  ,  , we
presented a theory of multi-forms and applied it to general gauge
theories, and in section 2 we review the parts of that which will be
used here. Earlier work on the application of differential analysis to
higher spin gauge theory appeared in  ,
  and a similar multi-form construction was used
in  ,  .
While this paper was in preparation, 
  appeared which gave further discussion of the
spin-three theory and briefly discussed field equations for general gauge
fields.





Multi-form gauge theory 
We begin by reviewing the multi-form construction of gauge theories
with gauge potential transforming in an arbitrary irreducible
representation of . Much of the material in this section is given in  ,  . For a
discussion of Young tableaux, see  .




Multi-forms 
A multi-form   of order  is a tensor field  that is an
element of the -fold tensor product of -forms (where
), written



X^p_1 ,..., p_N   :=  ^p_1  ... ^p_N 

In general, this will be a reducible representation of
. The components of  are written

 and are taken to be totally antisymmetric in each set
of  indices, so that



T_ ^1_1 ... ^1_p_1  ... ^i_1 ... ^i_p_i  ...
 ^N_1  ...  ^N_p_N     = T_[  ^1_1
... ^1_p_1  ] ...[  ^i_1 ... ^i_p_i  ]... [  ^N_1 
...  ^N_p_N  ] 

The generalisation of the operations on ordinary differential forms to
multi-forms of order  over  is as follows.

The -product is the natural generalisation of wedge product to multi-forms and is given by the map



: X^p_1 ,...,p_N   X^p' _1 ,...,p' _N   X^p_1 +p' _1 ,...,p_N +p' _N  

defined by the -fold wedge product on the individual form subspaces.

There are  inequivalent exterior derivatives




d^(i)  : X^p_1 ,...,p_i ,...p_N   X^p_1 ,...,p_i +1
,...,p_N  

which are individually defined as the exterior derivatives acting on
the  form subspaces. This definition implies
 (with no sum over ) and that    commutes
with   for any .
Since the multi-form space  is isomorphic to the
multi-form space  of one order higher, one
can introduce a further derivative operator on , defined by



 := d^(N+1)  : X^p_1 ,..., p_N   X^p_1 ,... ,p_N
,1 

This follows by taking the partial derivative of a multi-form 
 to define an element in  with
components 
.
One can also define the total derivative



D    :=  _i=1 ^N  d^(i)  ,    D  : X^p_1 ,...,p_i ,...p_N   _i=1 ^N 
 X^p_1 ,...,p_i +1 ,...,p_N  

which satisfies .


For representations of  there are
 inequivalent Hodge dual operations



*^(i)  : X^p_1 ,...,p_i ,...p_N   X^p_1 ,...,D- p_i ,...p_N  

which are defined to act as the Hodge duals on the individual
 form subspaces. This implies that 
 (with no sum over ) and that   
commutes with   for any .

This also allows one to define  inequivalent adjoint' exterior
derivatives



d^ ^(i)   := (-1) ^1+D( p_i +1)  *^(i)  d^(i)  *^(i) 
: X^p_1 ,...,p_i ,...p_N   X^p_1 ,...,p_i -1 ,...,p_N  

This implies  (with no sum over ) and any
two  commute. One can then define the Laplacian
operator



 := d^(i)  d^ ^(i)  + d^ ^(i)  d^(i)  :
X^p_1 ,...,p_i ,...p_N   X^p_1 ,...,p_i ,...,p_N  

with no sum over . The action of the Laplacian
operator on multi-form  is independent of which
 is chosen for . This can be seen in component form
since 

,
where  is the D' Alembertian
operator on .

There exist  inequivalent trace operations



^(ij)  : X^p_1 ,...,p_i ,..., p_j ,...p_N   X^p_1
,...,p_i -1,..., p_j -1,...,p_N  

defined as the single trace between the  and
 form subspaces using the Minkowski metric
. This allows one to define two
inequivalent dual-trace' operations



^(ij)   := (-1) ^1+D( p_i +1)  *^(i)  ^(ij)  *^(i) 
: X^p_1 ,...,p_i ,..., p_j ,...p_N   X^p_1 ,...,p_i
+1,..., p_j -1,...,p_N  

and



 ^(ij)    := (-1) ^1+D( p_j +1)  *^(j) 
^(ij)  *^(j)  : X^p_1 ,...,p_i ,..., p_j ,...p_N   X^p_1 ,...,p_i -1,..., p_j +1,...,p_N  

associated with a given  (with no sum over  or ).
Notice that  since
. This implies that the components  are equal to .

There are  inequivalent involutions



t^(ij)  : X^p_1 ,...,p_i ,..., p_j ,...p_N   X^p_1
,...,p_j ,..., p_i ,...,p_N  

defined by exchange of the  and  form
subspaces in the tensor product space. The components  are proportional to  (assuming ).

There are also  inequivalent product operations



^(ij)  : X^p_1 ,...,p_i ,..., p_j ,...p_N   X^p_1 ,...,p_i +1,..., p_j +1,...,p_N  

defined as the -product with the  metric  (understood as an order  multi-form with all columns of zero length except , corresponding to a
 bi-form
 in the  subspace), such that  for any . The components  are equal to  (with implicit antisymmetrisation on the   and   indices seperately). 
 




Irreducible representations and Young tableaux 

The space of multi-forms  is in general a reducible
representation of . Each irreducible representation
of  is associated with a Young tableau. Consider
the representation associated with a Young tableau with  columns and
with  cells in the th column (it is assumed 
); we denote this representation as . A
tensor  in this representation is a multi-form 
 satisfying



^(ij)  A  = 0

for any  and also satisfying  if the th and
th columns are of equal length, 
 . The projector from  onto this
irreducible tensor representation  is the
Young symmetriser .

For example, consider a rank  multi-form in  (with
 and all ). This is the space of all rank  tensors
, with no index symmetry properties and so
is a reducible representation of . The projector
 takes this to the space of totally
antisymmetric tensors
, while
 takes this to the space of totally symmetric
tensors . The
full set of irreducible representations are obtained by acting on
 with all projectors  with

 satisfying .





Multi-form gauge theory 
Consider a gauge potential  that is a tensor in the 
 irreducible representation of  whose components
have the index symmetry of an -column Young tableau with 
cells in the th column (with ). The natural gauge
transformation for this object is given by  



 

for any gauge parameters 
.

The associated field strength  is a type 
tensor given by



 

which is invariant under ( ). The first expression is
unambiguous since all  commute.

From the generalised Poincare  lemma in  ,
 ,   it follows that any type 
 tensor  satisfying  for all  can
be written as in ( ) for some type 
potential . The field strength  satisfies second Bianchi
identities



 

and the first Bianchi identities



 

for any .

Considering the irreducible representations of 
above to be reducible representations of the  Lorentz
subgroup allows the construction of a gauge-invariant action functional
from which physical equations of motion can be obtained.

For  odd, the natural field equation for a general type 
 gauge potential  is given by



 

where the sum is on the labels  whose values vary
over all permutations of the set . The th label is not
included in the sum. The fact that the Young projection  onto the irreducible  tensor
 subspace is not required in this expression is shown in Appendix B. For  even, the field equation for
a type  gauge potential  is given by



 

where the sum here is on all the labels  whose
values vary over all permutations of the set . The Young
projection  is again unnecessary.

If
these field equations can be derived from a gauge-invariant action, it must be of the form



 

in terms of the type  gauge potential  and some
gauge-invariant field equation tensor  involving  partial
derivatives on  for even  (or  derivatives for odd ).
Gauge invariance of ( ) requires that 
should satisfy the  conservation conditions 

 identically for . For  even, the leading term in    involves  traces of the
field strength  of  and is given by the sum over all permutations of  labels of
the term 

. The correction terms then consist
of   further traces (appropriately symmetrised) with coefficients
fixed by overall conservation of   ,
so that the field equation  is a linear combination of the field equation given above and its multiple trace parts.
 For  odd one can consider the
potential to be a type  tensor of even order 
whose field strength  is a type 
tensor. The construction of  is then the same as for the even 
case. The explicit form of  is discussed in Appendix B, where it is constructed explicitly 
for bi-forms and totally symmetric tensors, and a general form is conjectured.

For general  the local  gauge-invariant field equations above are
th order in derivatives for even  and of order  for odd .
Consequently they are higher derivative equations of motion for higher
spin fields with  involving more than two partial derivatives of
the gauge field. In the next section we give a method for obtaining
second order field equations for such higher spin  tensor fields with
arbitrary . This construction was described in  
for the case of totally symmetric spin- gauge fields. In our
notation such totally symmetric spin- fields are tensors of type
 with  entries.




Second order field equations 
The local gauge-invariant action ( ) for a general type
 gauge potential  can be modified by the
insertion of a negative power of the D' Alembertian scalar operator
. The resulting non-local action is given by



 

and is gauge-invariant for any power .
Formally, this gives field equations of order  for  even or
 for  odd, so that choosing 
 for  even and  for  odd
gives second order field equations. For any , these field equations are covariant and gauge-invariant, but are
non-local in general. We will show that the second order field equations become local in physical gauge, and it is to be expected that the non-localities could instead be eliminated by the introduction of auxiliary fields, as shown for  the spin-three case   in   .
For the case in which  is chosen to make the field equation zero'th order, the field equations 
imply the fields are pure gauge.

 Choosing   
 for  even and  for  odd,
gives  gauge-invariant field equations derived from
( )  that are
of second order and are given by the non-local expressions



 

for  even and odd respectively. The Young projections  and  in ( ) and ( ) are not necessary, following the theorem in Appendix B. These equations correspond to those proposed in
  for the case of a spin- gauge field with 
and all . The non-local action ( ) is then replaced by the
local action



 

in the   physical gauge



 

for any .


The second order, non-local field equations above are not unique.
Define  to be the order  tensor associated
with the canonical field strength tensor  of order  obtained by
acting on  with  partial derivatives. Then write



 

for the case of  even and odd respectively. The Young projections  (with  zeros) and  (with  zeros) in ( ) and ( ) respectively, are not necessary. It is clear by construction that ( ) and
( ) are related to the original field equation tensors in
( ) and ( ) and the equation  
 also reduces to  if one imposes  the physical gauge
conditions ( ). The field equations given by the vanishing of ( ) and
( ) are more restrictive than ( ) and
( ) in the sense that the gauge-invariant tensors in
( ) and ( ) vanish as a consequence of
( ) and ( ) though the converse statement is
not true

(A simple example to illustrate this fact is for linearised
gravity where  is the Ricci
tensor and 
 where
 is the full linearised Riemann tensor. It is clear
that the non-trivial Einstein equation  in 
implies the secondary field equation 
 (by tracing the second Bianchi identity 
) so that  implies
 but not vice versa. This structure follows in the
general theory where one expands a given field equation of level  (i.e. ) and finds only lower field equations of levels  and their various
secondary' field equations derived using these lower level
equations and the associated Bianchi identities.) 

. One of these associated field equations is noted in
  for the case of a spin-3 field. In our framework
this example corresponds to the case in which , 
 and . As noted in  , this second order field
equation  is simply related to a linear combination
of the equation  and its trace.
In general, one can consider field equations given by linear
combinations of these tensors,
 or 
for some coefficients , but these will generally be more restrictive than ( ) and ( ).




Connections 

The linearised
Riemann tensor can be written as the (appropriately symmetrised) single
derivative of a first order linearised connection, such that

 where 

. More generally,  ,  , the field strength of a 
general spin- gauge
field can be written as a
derivative of a rank  linear connection involving 
derivatives of the spin- gauge field. We show that such a linear
connection structure arises for general tensor gauge theories.

The type  tensor field
strength associated with an arbitrary type  gauge
potential  satisfies  for all . For any given ,
this implies that  is -exact, so that



 

(with no sum over ) where  
 is defined by



 

Notice that  is a multi-form involving 
derivatives of  but is not -irreducible in 
general. Under
the gauge transformation ( ),
 transforms as



 

and is invariant under the transformations with parameter  for any ,
so that  is gauge-invariant. All   are
inequivalent if no two column lengths  are equal. For any two columns
 and  of equal length (with ) then
 and  are equivalent
under transposition, in the sense that 
 (with no sum over ). This explains
why only a single linear connection is realised in  ,
  for a spin- gauge field with all .

Note that for gravity, the linearised Christoffel connection
 is related to the bi-form connection  defined in 
this way by 
and is distinguished by its transformation property

 under .
For totally symmetric tensors, generalisations of the linearised 
Christoffel connection  were proposed in  , and these are related to linear 
combinations of the , but for the general case, the multi-forms  seem to be more natural in the linear theory.

For a totally symmetric spin- field, there is in fact a hierarchy 
of connections
 , and the same is true for general   tensor gauge fields 
with gauge-invariant field strength
.
In addition to the 
multi-forms  of order  in derivatives
defined above, one can  define  multi-forms
of order  in derivatives as



 

by   pulling off  different exterior derivatives from the
definition of  in all possible inequivalent ways. Consequently, at
the top of the hierarchy there is one  and at the
bottom there is also one inequivalent 
. It is always possible to write  in terms of any one of
these multiforms since



 

Therefore, by construction, each multi-form 
 transforms in such a way that  is invariant under gauge
transformation ( ).




First order fermionic field equations 

It is straightforward to generalise the analysis of a bosonic tensor 
gauge field
in the representation   
to the case of a  fermionic spinor-valued tensor gauge field in the 
representation
 of (the cover of) the Lorentz group, given
by the tensor product of the tensor representation with the Dirac spinor representation
 (with no constraints on traces or gamma-traces).

For a Dirac spinor ,
the Dirac equation  implies the
Klein-Gordon equation  (where  and ) while the Dirac equation
can formally be obtained by acting on the Klein-Gordon equation 
 with the
non-local operator .
Similarly for a Dirac spinor-valued vector (gravitino) , the
Rarita-Schwinger equation 
 (where 
)
implies the Maxwell equation 
, and conversely
  acting on the  Maxwell equation with 
  gives an equation equivalent to the Rarita-Schwinger
equation  .

In   first order field equations were given for general spinor-valued totally symmetric rank  tensor gauge fields (referred to as spin- fields) in the 
 representation, which are invariant under gauge transformations 
with constrained parameters. In  ,
a non-local form of these equations was found which is invariant 
under gauge transformations with unconstrained parameters.
Consider the case of a spin- tensor field  whose first order field equation
in   is



 

where .
( ) is   only  gauge-invariant under
 
if the spin- parameter satisfies the constraint .  A non-local  fully
gauge-invariant field equation   is obtained by 
taking the linear
combination



 

of ( ) with its trace. This is invariant under 
( )
with unconstrained parameter.
Acting on
( ) with  one obtains the second order linearised 
Einstein
equation



 

which is gauge-invariant and local. Conversely, one obtains
( ) from ( ) by acting with  on the latter. The
generalisation to arbitrary spinor-valued spin- fermionic fields is
then straightforward  ; one
obtains fully gauge-invariant field equations by taking non-local
linear combinations of the field equation



 

from  , where .
A second order field equation is obtained by acting on
the first order gauge-invariant field equation with
, and this second order equation for a spinor-valued 
spin- fermionic field is that discussed in previous sections for a spin- 
bosonic field
but with  replaced with . The first
order field equation is regained by acting on this second order equation with .




First order equations for general 
tensors 

This generalises to  general spinor-valued tensor fields.
The operations on multi-forms extend trivially to spinor-valued
multi-forms. The
local gauge-invariant action   for a fermionic field 
 is



 

where  denotes the Dirac conjugate of . The gauge-invariant type 
fermionic field equation tensor  involves  partial
derivatives on  for even  (or  derivatives for odd )
and  is identical, as an operator, to that given earlier in terms of
derivatives of . In particular,   again satisfies the  
conservation
conditions  identically for .
For  even, the fermionic field equation derived
from ( ), for a general type 
fermion  is given by



 

whilst for  odd, the derived fermionic field equation is given by



 

where  is the fermionic type 
 tensor field strength for .

Non-local first order field equations can be obtained from these
local higher derivative equations by acting with 

for suitable .
The non-local gauge-invariant action is



 

where, as in ( ), the power  is chosen to be 
 for  even and  for  odd so that the
derived field equations are of first order. The  gauge-invariant  field
equations are given by



 

for  even and odd respectively. For spinor-valued spin- fields
(with  and all ) these gauge-invariant fermionic field
equations correspond to those proposed in  .


As in the bosonic case, one can construct associated first order non-local field expressions



 

for the case of  even and odd respectively. The field equation ( ) implies the vanishing of
( ) for all  while ( ) implies that 
( ) are zero. In general, one can also consider general gauge-invariant field equations which are the linear combinations  or  for some coeffiecients .

The non-local action is replaced by
the local Dirac form



 

on imposing the physical gauge conditions



 

for all . Note that the second of these constraints implies  for any . This follows by multiplying the gamma-tracelessness condition by  and using  for  (since the tensor part of  is -irreducible).

To conclude, we have



 

as an operator equation for any spinor-valued fermionic tensor field
, where  correspond to the second order
operators defined in ( ), ( ),
( ) and ( ) but now acting on . This
generalises the result in  .

Appendix A : Fixing to physical gauge for higher spins 

A free massless gauge field in  dimensions can be reduced, by gauge 
fixing and using the field equations, to the dynamical degrees of 
freedom corresponding to a field in a representation of the little
group  satisfying a free field equation.
Rather than fully fixing such a light-cone gauge, it will be sufficient 
here to consider the
analogue of the transverse traceless gauge in general relativity, 
and we shall refer to such gauges as physical gauges'.
For example, consider a free massless totally symmetric tensor gauge 
field  of rank .
The gauge symmetry can be used to impose a gauge condition such as
 off-shell.
However, if  satisfies its field equation,
further restricted gauge transformations are possible while preserving 
the gauge conditions and these can be used to make  traceless, and the field 
equation then reduces to the free one .
Then  is in physical gauge if

 

on-shell, where  is the (inverse) -invariant 
metric. We now discuss this gauge-fixing in more detail for the examples .

A massless field with  describes a linearised graviton  whose field equation is the linearised Einstein equation

 

where  is the trace. ( ) is invariant under the gauge transformation

) 

for any one-form parameter . The De Donder gauge choice

 

uses  gauges symmetries to impose  constraints, but
doesn't quite fix all the gauge symmetry, as it allows gauge transformations 
preserving the constraint ,

 

restricting the gauge transformations to those with parameters  satisfying .
For on-shell configurations satisfying ( ), this residual symmetry
can be used to eliminate the trace of the on-shell graviton . The field equation ( ) implies
 (using ( )) and for  satisfying this, one can solve
the equation

 

for some  satisfying  (see e.g.  ), and so a gauge transformation with parameter  can be used to set  on-shell. Setting  implies that 
( ) reduces to  and ( ) reduces to , and the transverse traceless or physical gauge is achieved.

For , the field equation for a massless gauge field   is 

 

where  is the 
trace. This non-local equation is invariant under the gauge transformation

 

for any second rank symmetric tensor parameter . A convenient gauge choice is

 

but this still allows gauge transformations with
parameters   satisfying

 

These can now be used to eliminate the trace  provided  satsfies the field equation ( ). The field equation ( ) and gauge condition ( ) imply that the trace satisfies

 

Given a second rank symmetric tensor  which satisfies   

 

together with

 

one can can perform a gauge transformation with parameter  to set , so that ( ) reduces to  and ( ) reduces to .

It remains to show that a tensor  can be chosen to satisfy ( ), ( ). Define

 

The strategy, following  , is to arrange for  and 
 to vanish on an initial value surface  (where  is 
the time coordinate and   for any tensor ). Then if
,  will vanish everywhere and ( ) will hold.
Note that the trace of ( ) vanishes identically, so that no constraint 
is imposed on  by ( ). Then  can be  
chosen to satisfy

 

so that this and ( ) imply  (using ( )), so that  is 
harmonic when  is on-shell.
Then ( ) becomes the following constraint on , 
the trace-free part of ,

 

On the initial value surface  we choose , 
 to satisfy

 

and

 

where  with  are the spatial coordinates and 
.
These ensure that  and  on .
Then  is chosen to satisfy ( ) and ( ); given the 
initial values of ,  at , this 
determines  uniquely.
Then as , it follows that  everywhere, and 
as a result ( ) and ( ) are indeed satisfied, as required.

For , a massless field  can satisfy the field equation

 

where  and 
 are the single and double traces. The non-locality in ( ) is again necessary so that it is invariant under the gauge transformation

 

with unconstrained third rank totally symmetric tensor parameter . The gauge constraint

 

restricts the gauge transformations to those with parameters  satisfying

 

These can be used to set the single trace  to zero when
 satisfies its field equations. The field equation ( ) and gauge condition ( ) imply that the trace satisfies

 

and that

 


A third rank totally symmetric tensor  satisfying

 

and

 

can then be used as a parameter of a gauge transformation with  that sets , so that ( ) reduces to  and ( ) reduces to . 

As before, such a tensor  can be found by first specifying ,  on an initial value surface  and then using a wave equation for  to fix the tensor 
everywhere. Note that the trace of ( ) does not restrict , but does imply

 

Equation ( ) implies 

 

and both sides of this equation are constant, as a result of ( ), ( ).
Defining

 

then if  is chosen to satisfy

 

it follows that  on-shell. As above, ,  can be chosen 
at  so that  and  at , and these 
together with ( ), ( ) determine  everywhere. It then follows that
 everywhere and so ( ) and ( ) are satisfied, as required.



Appendix B : The generalised Einstein tensor for type  gauge fields 

As has been seen, the quadratic action for a type   gauge field  is naturally written in terms of a generalised Einstein tensor  which is a gauge-invariant type   tensor that is conserved (i.e.    for all ). It is straightforward to construct  in simple examples such as those discussed in the introduction. In this appendix we use the multi-form structure to write an explicit form for  in some simple cases and the leading terms in the general case. Based on these results we propose an expression for the form of  in the general case.
 
Before discussing the construction for general , it will prove useful to present the details for the  case. This class of bi-form gauge theories is illustrative of the general structure. In this case, we can use the simplified notation of  ,  , dropping the superscript  and replacing the the superscript  with a tilde, so that , , and omitting the superscript , so that, e.g. . We begin by noting the following identities for bi-form operators acting on a general element 



 

with similar relations holding for the operators with tildes. 

The general form for  can be written as



 

for some coefficients , and these coefficients are fixed by requiring that  be conserved.
For a gauge field  (with ) with field strength , the identities ( ) imply that  for any powers  and  (since ). 
This implies that each term in the sum ( ) is annihilated by  and so as a result each term in the sum is -irreducible, in the  representation.
The identity 



 

allows the coefficients in ( ) to be determined order by order in the expansion in the powers of  by requiring conservation of  at each order. Requiring that  satisfies  and  identically fixes the coefficients, giving the result 



 

and  is in the  representation, as required. The generalised Einstein equation  implies  for . For example, for linearised gravity,  and the usual Einstein equation  implies that the Ricci tensor vanishes in dimensions , but in the critical dimension ,  is an identity implying no restriction on the Ricci tensor.

We now turn to the general case of multi-form gauge fields .
The following identities for operators acting on a general element  will be useful 



 

Operators with distinct labels commute. Repeated labels are not to be summed. 

The field equation for even   was given by ( ) (or (45)) involving multiple traces of , while that for odd   was
formally very similar, given by  ( ) (or (46))
but with  replaced by the tensor , corresponding to a tableau with an even number  ()  of columns. 
Below we will discuss the case of even ; similar formulae can be used for the odd  case provided 
 is  replaced by  .


Theorem :   For a gauge field  (with ) with field strength , the identities ( ) imply that 



 

since  for any . The sum is over all values of  in  with no  equal. There are 



 

such inequivalent terms.

(Two terms are said to be inequivalent if their indices cannot be rearranged such that they are proportional to each other.) 


Proof :   Begin by partitioning the sum in ( ) into two seperate sums for any given . The first sum  contains  inequivalent terms whose elements each have one  in the -fold trace of . The second sum  contains the remaining  inequivalent terms whose elements each have one  and one  where  and  are different labels for different terms but never equal  nor . Since each of the  traces have different labels then they commute and can be arbitrarily permuted. We therefore choose each  to be leftmost in . From ( ) it is clear that  commutes with all the traces in . Moreover,  commutes with all traces in  except the two  and  traces. ( ) shows that  anticommutes with the first of these traces  then anticommutes with the second  but also produces another term with  replacing each . More precisely this means  



 

where the sum on the right hand side is still over all labels  with . However, the first two traces in this sum have a common index  and therefore anticommute (using ( )). Since one sums over all inequivalent labels then for each  and , there will be a corresponding pair  and  and so this sum is identically zero. Using that  is irreducible under  then completes the proof.

The -irreducible term



 

is the leading term in . The first shifted trace term is given by  



 

with relative coefficient  chosen to ensure conservation of  to first order. This coefficient is computed using the relation



 

A natural guess for the next shifted trace term is that it should be proportional to



 

Similarly, a natural proposal for the general -trace correction term is that it be proportional to



 

The bracketed sum in ( ) is over all permutations of labels . Those permutations which occur more than once should be counted with multiplicity (hence the factor of 2 in the second term in ( )).  
In general, an explicit Young projection onto the  representation is required, although it can be the case, as in the bi-form examples above, that it is not needed as the term is already irreducible without projection.

This leads to the conjecture that  is given by



 

with coefficients  chosen so that . It is clear, however, that the structure of the higher trace correction terms is complicated and this makes the determination of coefficients  difficult for . 

The ordering of algebraic operators in ( ) (with all 's to the left) is chosen because  can be expressed as terms with only  and  traces of  (rather than a sum of terms with all possible traces). This follows from the identities ( ). If our conjectured form for the shifted traces is correct, then it is to be expected that there
should be a general relation



 

for some polynomial  in  and . This structure was found above for  ( ) and  ( ) and will be checked in further examples below.  If ( ) is true then conservation of  implies    



 

after choosing .

A check of the conjecture ( ) is given by considering the example of totally symmetric rank  gauge fields. We 
again take  to be even; the odd spin case is similar but with
 replaced by . As noted in the introduction, the gauge-invariant field strength  for a spin- (type  tensor) gauge field is a type  tensor. The corresponding gauge-invariant field equation is defined using ( ) and is given by the vanishing of the spin- tensor  with components    



 

where  is the numerical factor defined in ( ) so that each inequivalent term in ( ) contributes with weight 1. The shifted trace terms are defined using ( ) and are also spin- tensors whose components are  



 

where  is the th trace of  for . There is just a single inequivalent trace  on totally symmetric tensors. The numerical factor 



 

ensures that each inequivalent term in ( ) contributes with weight 1. 
The shifted trace terms ( ) for spin- gauge fields are irreducible, without the need for an explicit Young projection - in contrast to the general case discussed above. This is due to the definition of the sum over permutations in ( ) which is equivalent to a total symmetrisation of indices when acting on a totally symmetric tensor.

Using the relation



 

then implies



 

where  and  for . These numbers agree with those found above for  for those values of  for which they are both defined. That is, one finds  from either ( ) or from ( ) and ( ). One can then solve for the spin- Einsten tensor with even  in the manner described above, so that



 

which satisfies the single inequivalent conservation condition  identically.
