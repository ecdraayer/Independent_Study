We introduce a new map between a -deformed gauge theory defined on a
general -covariant quantum hyperplane and an
ordinary gauge theory  in a full analogy with Seiberg-Witten map.
Perturbative analysis of the -deformed QED at the classical level is
presented and gauge fixing a  la BRST is discussed.

 

Introduction 

Motivated by the need to control the divergences in quantum electrodynamics,
Snyder proposed that one may use a noncommutative structure
for space-time coordinates. Although its great success, this suggestion has
been swiftly forsaken. This is partly due to a growing development in the
renormalization program which captivates all the attention of the leading
physicists. The renormalization prescription solves the quantum
inconsistencies without making any ad hoc assumptions on the space-time
structure. Thanks to the seminal paper of Connes the interest
in noncommutativity  has been revived. Natural candidates
for noncommutativity are provided by quantum groups. A
special role is played by the quantum Yang-Baxter equations which express
the hidden symmetry of integrable systems . Nowadays many applications have
appeared. One can mention conformal field theories,  as
well as in the vertex and spin models, , in quantum
optics and quantum gauge theories
.

In a recent paper we have constructed a new map which relates
a -deformed gauge field defined on the Manin plane 
 and the ordinary gauge field. This map is the
analogue of the Seiberg-Witten map. We have found this map
using the Gerstenhaber product instead of the
Groenewold-Moyal star product. In the present letter we
extend our analysis to the general -covariant
quantum hyperplane generated by the coordinates 
 and defined by 
, where  is the braiding
matrix.

This letter is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, We construct a new map
relating -deformed and ordinary gauge fields. In Sec. 3,  we present the
perturbative -deformed QED at the classical level and we introduce the 
-deformed BRST and anti-BRST transformations. This study prepare the
quantization of the model at hand.

-deformed gauge symmetry versus ordinary gauge symmetry 

The undeformed QED action is given by

 

where

 

 is invariant with respect to infinitesimal gauge transformations:

 

Let us now consider QED defined on a -covariant
quantum hyperplane 


This relation is governed by the braiding  matrix which is explicitly
given as:

 

In the deformed case one replaces the ordinary product by t he Gerstenhaber
star product defined by

 

where the undeformed product  is given by

 

A straightforward computation gives then the following commutation relations

 

whence

 

Thus we recover the commutation relations for the quantum hyperplane.

Let us illustrate by two examples:

The case  (the Manin plane):

 

Using this product it is not difficult to find the usual Manin plane
commutation relations: 

The case , we have

 

We can easily prove the commutation relations: 
 and .

If the spacetime dimension of the quantum hyperplane is  we have 
 terms present in the tensor product.

Let us take  with . Using
the expansion of (5) in  we find

 

The -deformed infinitesimal gauge transformations are defined by

 

To first order in , the above formulas for the gauge transformations
read

 

The solutions are given by

 

An additional term proportional to  appears. In the case where  is real and antisymmetric we find exactly the Seiberg Witten map.

The -deformed curvature  is given by

 

Using (11) and (14) we find

 

which we can write as

 

where  is the quantum correction linear in . The
quantum analogue of the action (1) is given by

 

Even for functions ,  that vanish rapidly enough at infinity,we have
 

This situation is in contrast with noncommutative geometry where the
equality holds.

Perturbative -deformed QED and gauge fixing a  la BRST 

The -deformed action (18)

 

where  is the undeformed action (1) and  is the correction
linear in  and given by

 

A gauge fixing term is needed in order to quantize the system. This is done
in the BRST and anti-BRST formalism. The quantum BRST transformations are
given by:

 

where ,  are the quantum Faddeev-Popov
ghost and anti-ghost fields,  a scalar field (sometimes called
the Nielsen-Lautrup auxiliary field) and  the quantum BRST
operator. The gauge-fixing term action is introduced as

 

An expansion in  leads to

 

This action corresponds to a highly nonlinear gauge.

The external field contribution is given by

 

where ,  are external fields
(called antifields in the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism) and play the role of
sources for the BRST-variations of the fields , .

The  and  play quite asymmetric roles,
they cannot be related by Hermitian conjugation. The anti-BRST
transformations are given by

 

Here  is the quantum anti-BRST operator. The
complete tree-level action is given by:

 

Concluding Remarks 

We have defined a -deformed QED at the classical level. Like in
noncommutative geometry we have found that the -deformed QED
action contains non-renormalizable vertices of dimension six. It is
worthwhile to study the quantization of the -expanded noncommutative 
 Yang-Mills action and -deformed BF Yang-Mills theory
 . We postpone these investigations to a future work.

Finally, we can claim, in bona fides , that the method developed in
this letter can be applied to various quantum -deformed models as well as
to -deformed model (the so-called Jordanian models)
.
