Abstract  

In here the matrix model approach, by Dijkgraaf and Vafa, is used in 
order to obtain the effective superpotential for a certain deformation
 of N=4 SYM discovered by Leigh and Strassler. 
An exact solution to the matrix model Lagrangian is found and is expressed 
in terms of elliptic functions.



Introduction 
Recently Dijkgraaf and Vafa  proposed a method using the matrix model to 
calculate the effective superpotential for N=1 supersymmetric gauge
theories , ,,
.
 In particular they showed for the mass
 perturbation of N=4
SYM theory down to an N=1 theory, that the effective superpotential
 agreed with the result by Dorey obtained with
 different methods.

One class of interesting N=1 superconformal theories are the ones
discovered by Leigh and Strassler as marginal and relevant
 deformations of N=4 SYM.
 We use the matrix model to extract the effective superpotential
for a particular relevant perturbation of N=4 SYM, discovered
by Leigh and Strassler. 
 This 
superpotential is very similar to the one studied by 
Dorey et.al., it differs though through the fields in
the q-deformed commutator, in their case they are 
 and  and in our case we have  and 
 therefore it could be of interest to really understand the
physical differences between them. In the case when the deformed 
commutator becomes an ordinary commutator they both reduce to the
mass deformed theory mentioned above.

Even though this case looks at first sight a bit more difficult
than the case studied by Dorey etc, it has some nice properties
that will be seen. For instance it transforms in a nice way under 
S transformation and the eigenvalue distribution is symmetrical distributed
around zero. We expect that these nice properties are due to the symmetries
between exchange of the fields which is absent in the other case.










The action and the elliptic world 
The superpotential of the Leigh-Strassler deformed SYM that will be 
investigated looks like
 
where the fields  are chiral transforming under .
Now we would like to apply the method of Dijkgraaf and Vafa in order to 
find an effective superpotential of the  theory in its confining
vacua. Accordingly we should look at the
partition function
 
and expand it around the classical vacuum where .
 The fields are all to be treated as
hermitian matrices.
 It would be nice to see that even in 
this case the equations of motions for the quantum fluctuation will yield
an elliptic structure, and indeed we will see that that is the case.
Integrating out  and  and diagonalizing 
the partition function looks like
d_i _j<i 
(_i-_j)^2 
(_i+_j)^2^2+(_i-_j)^2^2+4m^2 
_i e^-m g_s _i^2  _i^2^2+m^2  
Here we see that the effective action look like something with an external
quadratic potential well and the numerator as a coulomb force for electrons
moving in two dimensions, the denominator looks a bit more tricky with
both a repulsive part and an attractive. The classical minimum will be in 
the minimum for the potential well, which is . There is no force
pulling it more in the negative than the positive direction, so in the
quantum regime the eigenvalues will be distributed symmetrically around
.
Making the following change in coordinates 
_i=2m_i 2 
the partition function transforms into
d_i _j<i 
(_i-_j)^2 
(_i-(_j+2i)(_i-(_j-2i) 

_i e^-4m^3^2 _i/g_s^2 2 _i 
_i-(_i+2i) 
_i-(_i-2i)  
a bit of algebra makes it look like up to some constant:
d_i _j<i 
((_i-_j 2 )(_i+_j 2 ) )^2 
(_i-_j 2 -i)(_i+_j 2 +i)
(_i-_j 2 +i)(_i+_j 2 -i) 

_i e^-4m^3^2 _i/g_s^2 2 _i 
(_i+i) 
(_i-i)  
Now we rescale the 's with a factor of one half,
 because it will be convenient later on
and calculate the equations of motions from the effective action
2m^3 g_s^2 2 x-12 x 2 +
14 (x 2 +i)+14 (x 2 -i)=

_j [12 (x-_j 4 )-
14 (x-_j 4 +i)
-14 (x-_j 4 -i)]+

_j [12 (x+_j 4 )-
14 (x+_j 4 +i)-
14 (x+_j 4 -i)]
Here  is one of the eigenvalues for which we will solve the 
equation of motion.
We will use the fact that the
eigenvalues  are distributed symmetrical around 
then it implies that also  will be distributed symmetrical
 around , thus they will take values between say  and .
A resolvent can then be  introduced (see)
w(z)=12 dx (x) (z-x 2 ) 
where  and .
The resolvent will have a cut along the eigenvalues, , 
and the jump in the resolvent along the cut will give the density
-2i(x)=w(x+i)-w(x-i)
and the normalisation condition on the density can be expressed like
1=_-a ^a dx (x)=12i _C w(x)
where  is a curve going around the cut.
 Then the equations of motion
 can be written like
2m^2 ^2 2 x-S 2N x 2 +
S 4N (x+2 i  2 )
+S 4N (x- 2 i  2 ) =
 S N 
_j [(x-_j 2 )-
12 (x-_j+4i 2 )
-12 (x-_j-4i 2 )]
and the right hand side can be written in terms of the resolvent
S(2w(x)-w(x+4i)-w(x-4i))
here we introduced the 't Hooft coupling .
 This can in turn be written  as
g(x+2i)-g(x-2i)
where
g(x)=w(x-2i)-w(x+2i)
notice that  is periodic when  is shifted with .
We would also like to rewrite the left hand side in the same manner, 
with the same constant.
Let us have a look at the following function
h(x)=-ix +
S 4N _k=1 ^n[(x+k 4 i  2 )
-(x- k 4 i  2 )]
where . We see that
h(x+2i)-h(x-2i)
will be the same as the left side of () if , where
 is any integer such that  is in between zero and .
Here it should be mentioned that we have an arbitrariness in our
choice of , it is defined up to a constant,
 but in the end that constant would have to
be removed.
Then in that case the equations of motion can be expressed like
J(x+2i)-J(x-2i)=0,  x[-a,a]
where  is in between  and  and where , to
write it more explicit 
J(x)=ix -
S 4N _k=1 ^n[(x+k 4 i  2 )
-(x- k 4 i  2 )]+S(w(x-2i)-w(x+2i))
A small comment before proceeding, the Lagrangian from which 
the equation of motion was derived only contained a potential term
so that the force on a probe eigenvalue 
 is equal to the derivative of the potential with
respect to  which is nothing other than
f(x)=-J(x+2i)+J(x-2i).
Keep this in mind because it will be of use when the superpotential
is derived.
We can analytical continue  into the complex plane, and it is 
clear that
 is periodic with period  and in the strip ,
it is holomorphic besides the two cuts at  and
  and  simple poles at ,
 where  is
an integer between  and  and the integer  is chosen such that  
is in the interval  and . Another way to write  which might be
more illuminating is 
z_k=2k-1 2n+1 (-1)^[k-1 m ] (-1)^n+1 
where the bracket  stands for the integer part of what is inside.
In particular if we glue everything together we get a torus with poles in it
and it should be possible to express it then as an elliptic function.
An elliptic function is determined by its poles and the asymptotic
behavior.
 
figure=zplanrev.eps, height=6.7cm 
figure=uplanrev.eps, height=6.7cm 
Here you can see the z-plane and the u-plane and how
the loops are mapped. The imaginary axis between the cuts in the z-plane
are mapped to the imaginary axis in the u-plane, where 
and the imaginary axis above the cut in the z-plane is mapped to
the line  and  goes to . 
 
The asymptotic behavior we can see from  both when we let
.  is symmetric in .
J=i 2  e^z 
The structure of our equations are very much the same as
in and we could use similar techniques in order
 to solve the problem, 
the main differences is that here  is symmetric around  and
instead of a double pole at plus infinity, we have one simple pole
at plus infinity and one at minus infinity and also several other
poles coming pairwise.   is a doubly periodic function, 
one period coming from going around one cut and the other from going 
from one cut to the other, thus
 we can parametrize our system with 
 such that 
z(u+2)=z(u), & z(u+2

J(u+2)=J(u), & J(u+2From we get a  regular map between  and 
that satisfies the conditions ()
z(u) =H(u_+u) H(u__1(u/2_1(u/2++/2) 
if  where  is the standard quarter period and
 coincide with 
(see figure () to see the -plane and corresponding
-plane). Sometimes we will use the notation ,
because it is practical when dealing with the  functions.
We use the following Ansatz for the Elliptic function 
J(u)=A+B (u)-() +_u_k C_k (u)-(u_k) 
where  is the value of  that corresponds to the poles 
, thus this elliptic function has simple poles
 at  and ,
there are a lot of equivalent ways of doing this ansatz.
The constants  can be determined through the residues at
 in equation () and
 the constants  and  can be determined by  an expansion around
. First expand the expression () and then do 
the same for the original  expressed in terms of the theta functions.



See Appendix for further details, there  the following expressions
for the constants are obtained
B=-i 2 ()H(2) H'(0) 
A=BC ()-(u_k) +
i 2 
H'(2u_) 2H'(0) 
C=S 2N (z'(u)
)^-1 .


The Superpotential 
Now we would like to apply the methods of Dijkgraaf and Vafa to
obtain the effective superpotential. The effective superpotential
has the following form:
W_eff (S)=NF_0 S -2i _0 S,
 W_eff (S)=0
where  is the gauge coupling, 
 physics is invariant under a change of .
 This also has to be 
extremized  in order to get the effective potential, for the
Leigh-Strassler deformation, as a function of
the coupling constant .
 The great thing is 
that these terms in the expression for the effective superpotential
 can be expressed in terms of loop integrals
over the loops  and , see figure ().
From the expression for  (see () it is clear  that S  can be expressed
in terms of  a line integral around one
of the cuts of .
2i S=_A=_C_A  J(z)dz=_-++ J(u)z'(u)du
Here we have to be a bit careful because there are also the singularities
at , (see figure () and equations () and
()), with residues 
  up to a sign, thus integrating around
 the 
loop instead leads to
2i S (1+ n' N )=
_A'=_C_A'   J(z)dz=_- ^ 
 J(u)z'(u)du
where
n'= (-1)^[k-1 l ] =12 rem (2l-n 2l ),
there is a positive sign in front if  is odd and a negative sign 
if  is even, and  is the numbers of  poles, (this is
the same  which appeared earlier e.g. in the expression for ). The 
contribution  you get from the poles in the upper half -plane.
Observe that for  and  even,  is zero.

The other part  is the derivative of the planar
free energy and 
 can be calculated from integrating the force on the probe eigenvalue
() from the infinity to the eigenvalue cut, but also
here we should be careful, just as in the other Leigh-Strassler 
deformation studied by Dorey et.al., there is also a "zero point"
contribution to the free energy.
 From considering
the Lagrangian (), in the exponent there was the
 term 
this could have been rewritten like , that is we get 
a zero point energy contribution from that constant, which more
explicitly looks like , the zero genus free
energy is this times , that is . Thus the
total derivative of the free energy with respect to  becomes
 F_0 S =_ ^a f(x)-
2m^3 ^2 2 .
 The first part
can be rewritten as an integral over  going from the end of the
 upper cut to infinity and then back from infinity to the end of the
lower cut,  and can in turn be transformed to a
line integral  going directly from  the upper
cut to the lower. The singularities in the -plane is all
placed along the imaginary axis thus there are no problems deforming
the integral.
 _ ^a f(x)=_B=_C_2 
 J(z)dz=_-J(u)z'(u)du
One thing you could have been worried about concerning this deformation 
is  closing the loop  at infinity. In the  coordinates 
 the integrand above, , can be expanded
around the point in  corresponding to the infinity, there it will 
consist of a double pole and thus the residue will be zero, thus there is
no problem in closing at infinity for the , which we constructed.
An extra constant in  would have to be removed in order for this 
to work.

 We see that the effective superpotential
expressed in terms of the loop integrals:
W_eff (S)=N_B-_0_A'  1+ n' N  
-2N m^3 sin^2 2 .
Then extremizing the superperpotential
W_eff =N_B-_0_A'  1+ n' N  
=0
The loop integrals have some nice properties and the loop integral
around  can be expressed as (see Appendix)
_B=( +1  v_k N- n'  )_A
+2(2) 
and
_B=( + 1  
v_k N- n'  )_A
here we introduced the notation .
This gives us the relation between the  gauge coupling and the
elliptic parameter 
 (N+n')+1  
v_k =_0
and the effective superpotentials values at the different s 
W_eff =
2N(2) 2.
Here  should satisfy the solution above (), but because of the
non-trivial  dependence which  has we will look at two
different limits.
The summation over the  will be a constant when  is not too  
small or/and when  goes to zero, which can be seen to be
z_k=_1(_1(((+_1^ 1n q^2n  1-q^2n  2nv_k2nq will be very small for most 's and then the last sum will 
be negligible. Two cases can occur, either the  are pure imaginary
or .
 Then the relation between  and  can be expressed like
v_k=z_k/2
In this case  becomes
N-n' (_0-j-i)
where  is an integer or a half integer, if it is an integer it will
 correspond to a shift by  with 
 and  just the sum over all the imaginary 
values in  thus the effect is that  gets shifted by a constant and
also  get shifted.   
In the limit
 goes to zero in such a way that  will be an even number,
 will become  and  equation ()
 will coincide with the mass perturbed case
calculated by Dijkgraaf, Vafa and Dorey 
.


How  behaves for small values of  can be seen from using the modular
properties of the  functions
z_k=_1(_1(e^-i(v_k-e^-i(v_k+_1((_1((4i v_k ((((+v_k)/)  

We have to look at two different cases, the case when  is purely
imaginary, then the second term becomes  and in the 
other case the second term becomes . In the first case
then 
4i v_k z_k  =
(2k-1) l (-1)^[k-1 m ] (-1)^n+1 L_k

And the second case we have
 
4i v_k &= i 

 &=2[2k-1-(2n+1) 2l-2n-1  ]
(-1)^[k-1 m ] (-1)^n+1 -2i(-1)^p  2 M_k-2i (-1)^p
where  is an even number if  is positive and odd if  is 
negative.
For the expression of  see equation ().
The following relation holds between  and 
 =
(_0+j)/(N- n'+_kL_k/4 +
_kM_k/2 ) )
The second summation is over the  which fulfill the condition
2k-1>2l
and the first summations over the other 's.
So we see that the effect is that  get shifted with an half
 integer or an integer
and  gets shifted with something that sometimes is an integer and
for some special values of  it could be zero.

To get the gluino condensate we differentiate the effective superpotential
() with respect
to , that will also correspond to the  we calculated in
the appendix. Remember though to see that you have to remember that
the relation between  and  is in general a bit complicated.
Anyway taking the mass decoupling limit, letting 
together with  such that ,
where  is a constant, we see that we get that the effective
superpotential becomes a constant independent of  as it should. 


Classical vacua, confinement and S-duality 
In  they found that the
underlying S-duality from the  SYM was realized, in the
mass perturbed  case, via modular transformation on the gauge coupling
 relating the superpotential for
different massive vacua and a similar thing was found in.
In they extract an   version of the
Leigh-Strassler deformation they looked at and  found for instance
that the confining vacuum was related to the higgs vacuum  via S-duality. 
Here we will look at the eigenvalue distribution around the classical 
 and see what will happened to it if we perform an 
S-transformation and then take its classical limit. We will see 
that it is proportional to some of the classical vacua
of the theory.

Berenstein et.al. looked at the classical solutions to
the same model as we are considering. That is they started from the
superpotential
 W= Tr ( _1_2_3-q_1_3_2)+
m_i^2 ).
The F-flatness condition gave them the following relation between the
fields
[_j, _j+1 ]_q=_j+2 , cyclic on , mod  
from which they derived some of the vacua of the theory.
 The -commutator is defined
through . They did a field redefinition in order to 
get rid of the , in the same fashion a field redefinition can be made 
in order to get the commutator in the form we have. Let
 , then the commutator becomes
 q^-1/2 _i_j-q^1/2 _j_i.
Anyway in order to get the vacua they had to find irreducible
 representations to
this algebra. A certain class of these representations will be
 deformed  representations, thus in the case  the
algebra takes the form of .
 First they noted that there exist a one dimensional representation
for  looking like
_j=11-q 
and a two dimensional irreducible representation looking like
_j=-i 1+q _j
where the  are the Pauli matrices. This latter one can be looked 
upon as a deformation of  representation. Then they came up with an 
ansatz to find a general form of a deformed  representation.
In the case of even dimension 
 of the representation they found the following eigenvalues
to the matrices 
_n=1q^p-n (q^-1/2 +q^1/2 ) _2(p-n) [q]
where  , here
we have accounted for the rescaling of the field .
In the case    this can in
 fact be rewritten as
_n=((2(p-n)-1)) 2 
And in the case of odd dimension  of the representation, the eigenvalues 
they obtained look like
0, _n=_(p-n) [q^2] q^p-n  
They warn  that these solutions are not D-flat, but
the solutions is related to a D-flat solution via an 
transformation.



In they conjecture a method for getting the values for
the eigenvalues of the condensate of the field , we will see 
that this method indeed gives us the right type of expectation value
 of , and performing an S-transformation on
those eigenvalues  reproduces something proportional to
 the vacua above
in the classical limit .
In order to get the eigenvalue distribution the idea is now first to 
notice that the eigenvalues  to the field  is
_i=2m_i 2  2 
where  is between  and . The cut in the resolvent that
emerges in  is displaced from the position  of the
eigenvalues  with a distance  if we are considering 
the upper cut in the  plane for . Their proposal is then to
displace   with a distance  and then evaluate
the function  where the 's have been made continuous along 
the upper cut (the A-cycle)
(x)=2m( x-2i) 2  2 
=m 2 (
e^i _1^1/2 (x+/2-) 
_1^1/2 (x+/2+) 
-e^-i _1^1/2 (x+/2+) 
_1^1/2 (x+/2-) 
)


=m 2 (
_4^1/2 (x-_0/N') 
_4^1/2 (x+_0/N') -
_4^1/2 (x+_0/N') 
_4^1/2 (x-_0/N') 
)  x [0, 1]
here  stands for the shifted  we got when solving the equations
of motions. We will not be so careful about the shift and just considering 
 as if it were the usual , a more careful treatment should bee 
done, but now we  look at things very roughly.
It is easy to check in the classical limit  the 
expression above goes to zero, which is expected because we looked
at quantum fluctuation around the classical eigenvalue zero. 
Then they claim that the eigenvalues should be uniformly distributed
along this and the expectation value of the field squared should be given
by integrating  the square of this over the range of  gives.
^2(x) (x)=
2Nm^2 ^3 2 
(2) 2Nm^2 ^2 2 
Again the last part is just due to the zero energy. Here we see that
this at least are at agreement with the expression of the
effective superpotential (), to differentiate the
superpotential with respect to the mass should give as the
expectation value of the field .


Now we will 
see which nice properties this  has under S-transformation, 
letting  the eigenvalues 
becomes
(x)
=m 2 (
_3^1/2 (x--1/_0N') 
_3^1/2 (x+-1/_0N') 
-_3^1/2 (x+-1/_0 N') 
_3^1/2 (x--1/_0N') 
)  x [-12 , 12 ]
Now we like to see what will happened with this in the classical 
limit . It is easy to take the limit if 
we use the modular transformation rules of the theta function
_3(x)=
(-i)^1/2 e^-i x^2/ _3(x/-1/)
using this we get that the  equals
(x)
=m 2 (
e^-2ix N _3^1/2 (_0 N(x-)_0N) 
_3^1/2 (_0 N(x+)_0N) 
-e^2ix N _3^1/2 (_0 N(x+)_0 N) 
_3^1/2 (_0 N(x-)_0N) 
)
The theta three's goes to one in the limit .
Thus after doing an S-transformation on  wee see that it 
becomes in the classical limit
(x)=im(2x N) 2 
We could say that also  are supposed to transform under S  like
 then the above expression
 can be
written like
(x)=im2 2/ 
(2x  N) 2 
This expression is up to the strange factor in front of it
equal to the classical eigenvalues () if
you make a discretization of .  


Conclusions 
First of all an exact solution to the Leigh-Strassler deformation
under consideration was found and was shown to have of an elliptic
structure. The solution was found for special values of the parameter
, which parametrize the deformation, these 's were the ones
that could be written as some fraction of . 
 The solution was used to apply 
the method proposed by Dijkgraaf and Vafa, to find an effective
superpotential for the Leigh-Strassler deformation and thus the
gluino condensate.
It looks very similar to the effective potential of the other Leigh-Strassler 
deformation which has been studied in this contexts, but there are some 
crucial differences as the symmetry around the expectation value of the
field  and its elliptic parameter  has a more complicated
 dependence on the gauge coupling constant
 , which might be of interest. For some special 
you get the same simple  dependence as in the earlier studied cases.

Then we had a brief look at how -transformation acts on the 
solution and saw that the confining vacuum was related 
to some higgs vaccum in the classical limit.





 
Calculations 
For all the relations between elliptic functions and theta functions
and the integrals over them see and 
The coefficients 
The constants  can be determined by the fact that the residue of
 () around  should coincide with the residual of
() around .
Do a Laurent expansion of  around  in 
()
S 4N (x-z_k 2 )=
S 2N 1x-z_k 
Then using , where  is given by  and expanding
 it around  and
put it in the equation above
S 2N 1z'(u)(u-u_k) 
Expanding () around  gives
C u-u_k 
And from putting the residuals equal C becomes
C=S 2N z'(u)
)^-1 
Now we can decide the constants  and  through doing an expansion around
. First do it for the expression ()
J(u)=A+B B2+C ()-(u_k) 
If we use equation () for  and put in the expression
for  in terms of theta functions we get the
behaviour at infinity as
J(u)=i 2 (H(2u_) H'(0)(u_-H'(2u_) H'(0) )
From here we get A and B expressed in terms of theta and elliptic functions
B=-i() 2 H(2) H'(0) 
A=BC ()-(u_k) -
iH'(2u_) H'(0) 

The integral calculations 
The two integrals of interest in order to get the effective superpotential
is:
_A' =_C_A'   J(z)dz=_- ^ 
 J(u)z'(u)du
And
_B=_C_B  J(z)dz=_-J(u)z'(u)du
z'(u)=H'(u+) H(u+) -
H'(u-) H(u-) =
(u+)-(u-)-2(_1)   =

-(u)-() +2()-2(_1)  
=-(u)-() +
H'(2) H(2) -2The integral can be divided in the following pieces,
 which can be rewritten in standard
elliptic integral forms. First the piece consisting of the poles  having
the constant  in it
_1=-B()1((u)-())^2 +
B (H'(2) H(2) -21(u)-()   =

-B[ (u+) (u-)  
-1

.-(2() 
2+
12H'(2) H(2) ) 
((u-) (u+)  
+2u())
]
and the part consisting of 
_2=C(-(u_k)-() +
H'() H()  ) 
1(u)-(u_k) 

+1 (u_k)-() C(u)-()  =

-S 2N [ (u-u_k) (u+u_k)  
+2u(u_k)]+C (u_k)-() 
[ (u-) (u+)  
-2u()]
The only contribution of the integral over the constant  comes from
 the  curve
_3=A_C_2  dz=4i(
 B2C ()-(u_k) -
iH'(2u_) 2H'(0) )
The terms in  and  linear in  will just relate
the integrals with a factor of ,
 that is  
(linear in ). 
From looking at the integrands we see that we need to know
[(u+) (u-)  ]_- ^ =
(+) ((-+) (-2(+) (2_1(/2-+/2) _1(/2++4/=4/and
[(u+) (u-)  ]_-2_1(/2-+/2) _1(/2+4/=4i+4/And last we need
[(u+)+(u-)]_- ^ =4

[(u+)+(u-)]_-
 Now we see that
_B=_A'+2(2) S 2N 4i v_k
Using  the above becomes
_B=( 1+1  v_k N-n' )_A'+2(2) Useful relations between elliptic and theta functions
