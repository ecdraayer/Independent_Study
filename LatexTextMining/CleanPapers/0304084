Abstract

We point out that the solution of -dimensional gravity coupled to
the dilaton and an -form field strength can give rise to a flat
4-dimensional universe (with a scale factor) of the type proposed recently
under time dependent compactifications. The compact internal spaces could be
hyperbolic, flat or spherical and the solution is identical to the space-like
two brane or S2-brane. As has been shown previously for SM2 solution with 
a fixed field strength we show that for  (where the dilaton is 
vanishing and with a general field strength), 6 
the corresponding SM2 and SD2 solutions can give accelerating 
cosmologies in Einstein frame for both hyperbolic and flat internal 
spaces, thereby
meeting the challenge of obtaining such a solution from M/String theory
compactifications.


Since the discovery of the astronomical observation 
supported by the recent
measurement of cosmic microwave background that our 
universe is undergoing
an accelerated expansion in an early inflationary epoch, it has been a major 
challenge to obtain such models from M/string 
theory compactifications.
Recently Townsend and Wohlfarth (TW) 
have shown in a beautiful paper that such
accelerated cosmologies can arise from a solution of -dimensional
vacuum Einstein equation compactified on -dimensional hyperbolic space
of time varying volume. For  this implies that realistic cosmology can
result from M-theory compactification on a hyperbolic space. Interestingly,
such a compactification does not violate the strong energy condition
and accelerated expansion is obtained in Einstein frame circumventing the
"no-go" theorem which forbids acceleration in standard 
compactification.

In this paper we show that not only the solution of vacuum Einstein equation,
but also that of the -dimensional gravity coupled to the dilaton and
an -form field strength gives rise to the flat 4-dimensional universe
(with a scale factor) of the type discussed by TW. The solution of the above 
system has already been obtained under the name space-like 
branes or S-branes(Seefor some 
related works on S-branes.) .
S-branes are time-dependent solutions with -dimensional Euclidean
world-volume and apart from time they have -dimensional hyperbolic,
flat or spherical spaces as transverse spaces. They can be understood to arise
as a time-like tachyonic kink solution of non-BPS D branesin string 
theory and might be useful to understand the time-like holography of the 
dS/CFT correspondence. It is clear from above that in 
order to get a 
4-dimensional world  should be 2 and so we will look into the S2-brane
solution of -dimensional theory. For , the dilaton will be put 
to zero and the corresponding solution would be the SM2-brane solution of
M-theory, whereas, for , the corresponding solution is the SD2-brane
solution of string theory. We will first show that all S2-brane solutions
in  gives rise to the flat, homogeneous, isotropic 4-dimensional 
universe
of the type discussed by TW. Then we show that for  both(
One may think that since SD2-brane solution can be constructed from SM2
solution by an analogue of direct dimensional reduction as in the static
case, it is not necessary to study both the cases together. However we point
out that there are more parameters in the SD2 solution than in the SM2 
solution. It is not clear how new parameters would be generated by dimensional
reduction and it would be interesting to understand reduction procedure
in this case.)  the 
SM2-brane and SD2-brane solutions give accelerating cosmologies in Einstein
frame for only hyperbolic and flat space compactifications
with time varying volume.
We would like to point out that in the 
context of SM2-brane solution () accelerating cosmologies arising for both
hyperbolic and flat space compactifications were first shown by Ohta
. However, the solution used inhas a slightly different form from the Chen-Gal'tsov-Gutperle (CGG) 
 solution  
we use here to demonstrate the accelerating cosmology
in the sense that the field-strength in
the former case has been chosen to a particular value which is not necessary 
in our analysis.  

The -dimensional gravity coupled to the dilaton and an -form field
strength has been solved by CGG and the solution is given as, 
ds^2 &=& - e^2A(t)  dt^2 + e^2B(t)  dx_(3) ^2 + e^2C(t)  
d_n, ^2

(t) &=& a(n+2) (n-1)  B(t) + c_1 t + c_2

F_n &=& b (_n, ) 
Here , ,  are functions of  which are chosen to satisfy
a gauge condition  to simplify the equations of motion. So, the
functions  can be expressed in terms of two functions  and 
 as follows,
A(t) = n g(t) - 3 (n-1)  f(t), 
B(t) = f(t), C(t) = g(t) - 3 (n-1)  f(t)
Also in the above  is the line element of 3-dimensional
Euclidean space and  is that of the hyperbolic space
(for ), flat space (for  = 0) and spherical space
(for ).  is the dilaton coupling to the -form field 
strength and ,  are integration constants.  is the field
strength parameter and  is the unit volume form
of .

By solving the field equations the functions  and  can be 
obtained as,
f(t) &=& 2    [ 2 
(t - t_0)]  + 1   (n+2)  (n-1) b^2  - 
a  (c_1t + c_2)

g(t) &=& 1 (n-1)   [(n-1) t
-t_1] , & for  (t-t_1), & for  1 (n-1)   [(n-1) (t
-t_1)] , & for   
where  and the constants ,  and 
satisfy
3c_1^2  +(n+2)^2 2(n-1) -n(n-1)^2=0
Also note that for an -form field strength the dilaton coupling 
 for  and we will put it to zero for . Eqs.(1) - (5)
represent the S2-brane supergravity solution in -dimensions. The metric
in (1) is given in the Einstein frame.

Now we note that using eq.(2) the metric in (1) can be written as,
ds^2 = e^-ng(t)+3n (n-1) f(t)  ds_E^2 + e^2g(t) - 6 (n-1) 
f(t) d_n, ^2
where,
ds_E^2 = -S^6 dt^2 + S^2 dx_(3) ^2
and the function  is defined as,
S(t) = e^n 2 g(t)  e^-(n+2) 2(n-1) f(t) 
The 4-dimensional metric  is given in the Einstein frame and it takes 
the standard form of flat, homogeneous, isotropic universe with a scale factor
 if we define the time coordinate  as . Thus
we have shown that S2-brane solution of -dimensional theory can 
be reduced to TW form. The 4-dimensional universe will be expanding if
, which implies
m(t) = n 2  dg dt  - (n+2) 2(n-1) df dt 
> 0
Furthermore the expansion will be accelerating if ,
which implies,
1 2  (dm(t) dt )^1/2  - m(t) > 0
We will first look at the case when the dilaton is vanishing. From the 
dilaton equation in (1), we have . Also from (5) we get for 
(It is easy to see that for general , the 
arguments of the hyperbolic functions appearing in (14) and (15) will 
simply be multiplied by this parameter.) 
= 3(n+2)/n  (n-1) 
Note that we have  in this case. So, the function  in 
(3) reduces to 
f(t) = -1 6 b^2 (n-1) ^2 3t 6(n+2) 
In the above we have set . Now in the following we consider the three
cases  separately.

2 
(a) Internal space is hyperbolic () 
2 

In this case the function  is given as
g(t) = 1 (n-1)  3(n+2)/n  (n-1)(3(n+2)/n 
t) 
For the accelerating expansion the conditions (9) and (10) in this case
give,
m(t) &=& - 3n(n+2)  2(n-1) (3(n+2)/n  t) + 
(n+2) 2(n-1)  3t > 0

& & 3  2  (n+2) (n-1)  (1 ^2
(3(n+2)/n t)  + 1 ^2 3t )^1/2  - m(t) > 0
For  the above conditions reduce exactly to the conditions (17) and
(18) of ref.. However, note that in our case the metric 
as well as the
scale factor  in (8) depend explicitly on the field strength parameter
 through the function  given in (12). But the scale factor in 
does not appear to contain the field strength as it is set to a particular
value. In fact the term involving the field strength is simply an additive
constant to the function  and therefore does not affect the conditions
(9), (10) for the accelerating expansion. It is therefore not necessary to set
it to a particular value. Since the solution of (14)
and (15) has already been studied in, for , 
we will not repeat it here.
We just mention that the above conditions could be satisfied simultaneously
for only negative value of  in a certain interval. In terms of the true time
coordinate  of the 4-dimensional world, this means accelerating 
expansion occurs for some interval in the positive time. The plots of 
the l.h.s.
of (14) and (15) for  were given in.

2 
(b) Internal space is flat () 
2 

In this case , where we have taken
the same value of  as in (11). Then the conditions (9) and (10) give,
m(t) &=& 1 2 3n(n+2)  (n-1)  + 
(n+2) 2(n-1)  3t > 0

& & 3  2  (n+2) (n-1)  1 
3t  - m(t) > 0
For , these conditions are exactly the same as in. 
An accelerated
expansion has been found for a certain period of  in the region , with
the positive sign of the first term in (16). The solutions of these equations
for  has been studied and the plot of the functions on the l.h.s. of the
conditions (16) and (17) showing an accelerated expansion has been given 
there. Unlike in the hyperbolic case there is no singularity at  here.


2 
(c) Internal space is spherical () 
2 

In this case the conditions (9) and (10) can not be satisfied simultaneously,
indicating that there is no accelerated expansion of the 4-dimensional universe
when the theory is compactified on spherical space.

Let us now look at the case when the dilaton is non-vanishing. For , the
corresponding solution is SD2-brane of type IIA string theory. We will find
a very similar behavior of the 4-dimensional universe as in SM2 case. The
function  in this case has the form,
f(t) = -1  ^2(t/2) e^2(4-n) 
(n+2) c_1t  b^2 (n-1) ^2 (n+2)  
The value of  and dilaton coupling  were given before. We have
chosen (Note that when , the parameter  
can not be removed by renaming other parameters as is done in.)  
and the value 
of the parameter  is chosen as
before in (11). Then the relation between the parameters  and 
is given from (5) as,
3 c_1^2   + (n+2) ^2 2(n-1)  - 3(n+2) 
(n-1)  = 0
Again we will discuss the three cases  separately.

2 
(a') Internal space is hyperbolic () 
2 

The function  has exactly the same form as in case (a) before. The 
conditions for the accelerated expansion (9) and (10) therefore give,
&& m(t) = 

&& - 3n(n+2)  2(n-1) (3(n+2)/n  t) + 
(n+2) 2(n-1)  (t/2) + (4-n) (n-1) c_1 
 > 0

&& 1 2  (n+2) (n-1)  (3 ^2
(3(n+2)/n t)  + ^2 2 1 ^2(t/2) 
)^1/2  - m(t) > 0
For ,  and the relation (19) simplifies to
15c_1^2 32  + 128 ^2 25  = 24 5 
Since the parameters are real we note from (22) that  lies between
 and  and taking , we get 
. The conditions (19) and (20) simplify for  to,
m(t) &=& 
 - 6 5 (2t) + 4
 5  (16t/5) - c_1 
16 > 0

& & 2 5  (3 ^2
(2t)  + 16^2 5 1 ^2(16t/5) 
)^1/2  - m(t) > 0
We do not get solutions of the above two conditions simultaneously for the 
whole range of parameters  and  mentioned above. We plot the 
l.h.s. of both the conditions (23) and (24) versus  in fig.1 for 
and . The plot shows very similar behavior as those obtained
in refs. i.e. the conditions are satisfied simultaneously 
for some
interval of negative  and beyond that the universe is decelerating
for both  () and  ().
Note that there is a singularity of the scale factor  at . However,
this remains unobservable since it is at an infinite proper time in the
future of any event with  and an infinite proper time in the past of
any event with . So, our universe will separate into two regions with
 and .
Also note that we have studied the evolution for particular values
of the parameters  and . There are in fact a large class
of solutions of the 4-dimensional world which would exhibit accelerated
expansions. The values of the parameters might get fixed by the detailed
knowledge of the evolution of the universe.

The function  in eq.(23) and the l.h.s. of eq.(24) are plotted
against  for  and  and are given respectively by solid
and dashed lines. 

2 
(b') Internal space is flat () 
2 

The function  in this case is as given in (b) above. The conditions (9) 
and (10) give,
m(t) &=& 1 2 3n(n+2)  (n-1)  + 
(n+2) 2(n-1)  (t/2) + (4-n) (n-1)  c_1 
  > 0

& & 1 22   [(n+2)^2 (n-1) ]^1/2 1 
(t/2)  - m(t) > 0
The parameters  and  are related by eq.(19). For  we get
from above,
m(t) &=& 6 5  + 
4 5  (16t/5) - c_1 
16  > 0

& & 42  5 1 
(16t/5)  - m(t) > 0
with the parameter relation given in eq.(22). Here also we do not get the 
solutions of (27) and (28) in the whole range of parameters  and 
given earlier. We plot the l.h.s. of both the conditions (27) and (28) in
fig.2 for  and  and we get an accelerated expansion
only for the positive sign of the first term in (27). Here there is no 
singularity of the functions in the l.h.s. of (27) and (28) at  unlike 
in the hyperbolic case. The accelerated expansion occurs at certain interval
of negative  as is shown in fig.2. The universe decelerates at 
both  (
) and  (). This range is continuously 
connected through . A similar behavior was observed for SM2 case in
.

 
 
figure=fig2.ps,width=12cm,height=8cm 
The function  in eq.(27) and the l.h.s. of eq.(28) are plotted
against  for  and  and are given respectively by solid
and dashed lines. 

2 
(c') Internal space is spherical () 
2 

Here the function  is given as,
g(t) = 1 (n-1)  3(n+2)/n  (n-1)(3(n+2)/n 
t) 
where we have used the same value of  as given in (11). So, the
conditions (9) and (10) give,
&& m(t) = 

&& - 3n(n+2)  2(n-1) (3(n+2)/n  t) + 
(n+2) 2(n-1)  (t/2) + (4-n) (n-1) c_1 
 > 0

&& 1 2  (n+2) (n-1)  (-3 ^2
(3(n+2)/n t)  + ^2 2 1 ^2(t/2) 
)^1/2  - m(t) > 0
For  they simplify to,
m(t) &=& 
 - 6 5 (2t) + 4
 5  (16t/5) - c_1 
16 > 0

& & 2 5  (-3 ^2
(2t)  + 16^2 5 1 ^2(16t/5) 
)^1/2  - m(t) > 0
The parameters  and  are related by eq.(22). We have checked that 
these conditions can not be satisfied simultaneously either for  or 
for .
So, there is no accelerated expansion of the 4-dimensional universe when the
theory is compactified on spherical spaces.

To summarize, we have shown that -dimensional gravity coupled to the
dilaton and an -form field strength can give rise to a flat 4-dimensional
universe with a scale factor of the type discussed by TW under time dependent
compactification. The solutions are S2-brane solutions of -dimensional
theory. For  (when the dilaton is put to zero) the corresponding SM2-brane
solution is shown to give accelerated expansion of the 4-dimensional universe
when the internal space is both hyperbolic and flat with time varying volume. 
Similar
conclusions were found even for  i.e. for SD2-brane case. Here there is 
a freedom of the choice of the parameters  and  whose exact
values might be determined by the detailed knowledge of the evolution of our
universe. 



Note added: 



After submission of the paper to the net I was informed by Lorenzo 
Cornalba and Miguel Costa that observations on accelerating cosmologies
for a similar theory (studied in this paper) compactified on the time 
dependent flat internal space have been made in.
