By treating the bulk-quantized Yang-Mills theory as a constrained
system we obtain a consistent gauge-fixed BRST hamiltonian
in the minimal sector.  This provides an independent
derivation of  the 5- lagrangian bulk action.
The ground state is independent of the (anti)ghosts
and is interpreted as the solution
of the Fokker-Planck equation, thus establishing a
direct connection to the Fokker-Planck hamiltonian.
The vacuum state correlators are shown to be in agreement
with correlators in lagrangian 5- formulation.
It is verified  that the complete propagators  remain parabolic
in one-loop dimensional regularization.




 



Introduction  

The usual formulation  of
4- gauge theory is based on the free
(euclidean) lagrangian action
S=_M ^4 dx F_ F^ 
 where
 is the curvature
of an  connection .
In recently introduced
bulk quantization  (that arose from stochastic quantization approaches
based on ideas of Parisi and Wu )
 one adds an extra fifth nonphysical
dimension  to the spacetime -manifold  .
All the fields of the theory are then defined on
the extended spacetime


(This  corresponds to the stochastic evolution parameter
or the Monte Carlo iteration time for numerical simulation).
The connection  is extended to include a fifth
component  and one has


A set of ghost fields is introduced with two independent
-gradings (ghost numbers)  and 
corresponding to BRST differentials  and , which
raise the respective ghost numbers by one and satisfy
(s+w)^2=0s^2=0,w^2=0,sw=-ws
The operator  provides a BRST implementation of the 5-
gauge symmetry, analogous to the usual BRST operator (usually called !) connected with
Faddeev-Popov ghosts.  Its cohomology  defines
observables. The operator  acts like a rigid
supersymmetry operator and has trivial cohomology.
Observables are not  required to be -exact.
Fields with
odd total ghost number  anticommute.
The action of  and  on the fields is defined as
 
 

 

Here  and

denotes the usual gauge covariant
derivative.  With some obvious renaming of fields this is
the BRST algebra of , with a minor exception .
To make the action of  on the
quartet  symmetric in form,
as it now is, to the action of  on
 we made the field redefinitions
_5 m + [,] and 
_5 -l - [,] + [,].
Otherwise one has in  
which, although simpler, lacks the aforementioned symmetry and
moreover leads to more cubic ghost interaction terms in 
than our choice here.

The 5- action for the theory is -exact and -closed
w I = 0
and is given by
I 
I &=& I_0 + I_gf  

I_0 && d^5x
   s[ _(F^5  - D_F^  + ^    +[^,c]) + (_5 - a'^-1 D_^-(D_5  - a'^-1 D^2)c)]

I_gf   && d^5x
      ws[]
where  and  are positive
constant parameters.
After expansion, the -exact
piece  fixes the gauge for  and
 to 
and .
The theory is well-defined in this gauge
and one has convergence of longitudinal modes.
From the 4- point of view this
axial type 5- gauge condition actually
corresponds to an infinitesimal gauge transformation  
, so there is no Gribov obstruction
associated with gauge fixing (see ).

Because all free
ghost propagators are retarded, closed ghost loops
vanish (except for tadpoles which can be ignored).  Since
ghost number is conserved, as long as one doesn't compute ghost
correlators the effect of integrating out the ghosts is simply to
suppress the ghosts in the action which, after integrating
out  as well and rescaling , yields
I_red  ' = -d^5x[
a^-1 (_tA_- D_A)^2
+ a(D_F^ )^2]
After analyzing this action in the Landau gauge limit
 one finds that the weight is concentrated
in the Gribov region, i.e., where  and
the Faddeev operator is positive,
.  The
physical content of the 4- theory, such as correlators, is
recovered by going to a time slice .
The reader is referred to  for details.

We will address here the question of finding the proper
hamiltonian corresponding to ().  An outline of how we
proceed is as follows.  We consider just , the gauge non-fixed
part of the action, and read off the hamiltonian, which has
simple first class constraints.  One has a choice of whether or
not to include  among the canonical
variables; the phase space without these variables is called the
the minimal sector . In the hamiltonian formalism the first
class constraints are generators of gauge transformations, and
hence of . To quantize the system one needs a
BRST gauge-fixed hamiltonian. According to homological
BRST theory,
a ghost-antighost pair is introduced for each constraint and used
to construct a BRST generator  for , which we choose to do
in the minimal sector for reasons outlined below. We then
obtain a gauge-fixed hamiltonian , the gauge
being fixed by the second term with  chosen
so as to give action  (a reduced form of  that
results after integrating out non-minimal fields).

We then go on
to show that the complete ghost propagators remain retarded
in one-loop dimensional regularization.
The retarded character of the full ghost propagators
allows us to establish an equivalence between the
quantum hamiltonian and lagrangian correlation functions.
We also argue that the ground state wave function 
has trivial ghost dependence, which provides a direct
connection to the Fokker-Planck equation
-d^4x  A_(x) 
[ A^(x)  -S_YM   A^(x) 
+a^-1 D_ A(x)]P(A)=0

Constrained hamiltonian 
The gauge non-fixed part of the action after expansion is
I0 
I_0    &=& I_F + I_+ I _c 

        I_F  &=& d^5x [ _ (F^5 
           - D_ F^ ) -_ (
             D^[5 ^] -D_ D^[ ^] 
             -[F^ ,_ ])]  

I_&=& d^5x [^2 + 2_[^,c]
+ [^ , _ ]] 

I_c    &=& d^5x c[(_5 - a'^-1 D_^                  -(D_5  - a'^-1 D^2)c] 

        &+& d^5x [ -(D_5 - a'^-1 D^2)  -[_5 - a'^-1 D_^,c]
  + a'^-1 [^,2D_c - _]]The gauge fixing term for future reference is
Igf 
I_gf  = d^5x[
              _5(A^5 - a^-1  A)
              + _5(^5 - a^-1 _ ^ )

               -(_5 -a^-1 D)                -( (_5-a^-1 D)               -a^-1 )]

First we look at the equations of motion generated
by varying  with respect to the fields
 and 
 

and obtain what are called primary constraints 
 and .  Note that we use the usual
convention that all functional derivatives with respect
to Grassman fields are left  derivatives.
It is of interest to observe that the constraints satisfy
s_1 =_2We substitute these constraints into the action , and
obtain a reduced form of the action ,
 where all terms linear in
 and  have been eliminated
by the equations of motion ().  In this
approach  and  play the role of lagrange multipliers
and are not  canonical variables.  This is
analogous to the role  plays in enforcing Gauss law 
in the minimal hamiltonian for electromagnetism
or Yang-Mills, where only  and  are
treated as canonical variables.  Thus
I_0 =d^5x ( A_^+
                    _^+ cc
                    - - H _C^min  
                    -^5_1 -A^5_2)
and the reduced form of the action is
I_0^min   &=& d^5x ( A_^+
                    _^+ cc
                    - - H _C^min   ),

-H _C^min    &=& ^2  + (2[_,c]
                 -D_F^ )_           + _(D_ D^[ ^] 
       +[F^ ,_ ])+[_,^]

            & &

           & & + a'^-1  c(D^2 c-D_^)
    + a'^-1  (D^2+[D_^,c] + [^,
      2D_c-_])One reads off  from  by dropping kinetic
terms and setting .  Since , as given in
(), is -exact it follows
 that  is also
-exact and can be expressed as
HCmin 
H_C^min   = d^4x
   s[ _( ^D_F^ 
    -[^,c]) -  a'^-1 D_(
               ^c)]
We now proceed with the analysis of this constrained
gauge system which goes according to a standard prescription,
as follows. The reader is referred to to for background
on constrained systems.  The constrained hamiltonian is written
_C + d^4x u^j_j, j=1,2
where the  are the lagrange
multipliers, here   and ,
enforcing the primary constraints .
In general the  may be chosen to be included in the
canonical variables.  In our case this would correspond to including the
 quartet in the phase space.
Such an approach is termed nonminimal .
Our analysis will be based on choosing the more economical
phase space, hence we use the  notation.  One can
in principle consider a nonminimal treatment, but it is
inconvenient for this system and hence remarks related thereto are
relegated to Appendix A.

We use  to denote the canonical hamiltonian
with the corresponding action .  The action
 with constraints is then called the extended action 
and  is termed extended hamiltonian .
The  notation is introduced
to represent weak  equality,
that is equality modulo functions that vanish on the constraint
surface in phase space described by .
 then determines time evolution of all functions 
of the fields by
TimeEvol 
F -_C + u^j_j,F
Here  is the graded Poisson bracket.  It is
defined on functions  and  of the fields as
F(x),G(y) =
d^4z [ F(x) ^a(z)  G(y) p_a(z) 
                 - F(x) p_a(z)  G(y) ^a(z)  

 + (-)^(F) ( F(x) ^b(z)  G(y) _b(z) 
         + F(x) _b(z)  G(y) ^b(z)  ) ]
where  denote all the commuting fields, the  their
momenta, and similarly for the odd  and .
It satisfies a graded Jacobi identity
(-)^(F_3  )(F_1  ) 
 F_1,F_2,F_3 + cyclic perms =0
Note that one has for odd fields
.
Moreover, if one expresses  in terms of
functional derivatives
s=d^4x [
^(x) A^(x) 
+

]



one finds that  acts as a graded
derivation with respect to the bracket
deriv 
sF,G=s F,G + (-)^(F) F,sG
The constraints  must be preserved in time, so we
apply () to  and get
 which
generates no further (what would be termed
secondary ) constraints.
Some computation (the Jacobi identity is useful)
shows that the constraints  close to generate a
Lie algebra (the structure functions are all constant)
alg1  _1^a(x),_2^b(y) &= (x-y)f^ab _ c  _1^c(y) 

 _2^a(x),_2^b(y) &= (x-y)f^ab _ c  _2^c(y) 

Here the  are the (totally antisymmetric)
structure constants of .
Note that we expect the second relation to follow from
the first by way of ().
It is not hard to check that .
Thus there are no secondary constraints at all.
Moreover, the constraints are
irreducible , meaning that the equations 
are independent.

For constrained hamiltonian systems a functional  whose
bracket with every constraint (including secondary,
if they are present) vanishes weakly
_m,F0 is said to be first class .
First class functionals have important properties.  From
the Jacobi identity it follows that the bracket of first
class functions is first class.  Also, the first class constraints
are the generators of gauge transformations gt 
_F(x) = -d^4y ^m(y)_m(y),F(x)
The ghost numbers of the infinitesimal gauge parameters
 are chosen so as to leave the ghost number of  invariant,
i.e., .  In our case  
and .
Since all constraints are first class, one need not introduce
Dirac brackets and the analysis of the system is
considerably simplified.
We remark that the analysis of the constraints is in general
highly dependent on where one draws the minimal sector, so
that constraints that are first class in one treatment may
be second class in another, likewise regarding
primary and secondary,
and some constraints may be altogether absent.


Now, for each generator , the corresponding gauge
transformation is given by (), but without sum on .
One has
epsalg 
    2 A_^a &=-(D__2)^a&
         1 A_^a &=0

    2 _^a &=[_2,_]^a&
         1 _^a &=-(D__1)^a

    2 _^a &=[_2,_]^a&
         1 _^a &=0

    2 _^a &=[_2,_]^a&
         1 _^a &=[_1,_]^a

    2 c^a &=[_2,c]^a&
         1 c^a &=-_1^a

    2 ^a &=[_2,]^a&
         1 ^a &= [_1,c]^a

    2 ^a &=[_2,]^a&
         1 ^a&=0

    2 c^a &=[_2,c]^a&
         1 c^a &= [_1,]^aThe full gauge transformations () of the fields are given by
A_&=-D__2 & _= [&_2,_]
-D__1 &  _=& [_2,_]
   & _=& [_2,_] + [_1,_]

 c = &[_2,c] -_1 & = [&_2,]
+ [_1,c] & =& [_2,] &
       c =&[_2,c,]  + [_1,]
which coincides with the remnant (after the  quartet is gone)
of the  algebra () when the
 parameters are replaced by variables of opposite statistics
_3, _4-, s= with ,  and
.
In  transformation properties
were imposed  on the fields by hand, as each new field was
added to the action, in such a way as to have  invariance of
the action .
From our point of view the gauge algebra and field transformations
are in fact determined  by the constraints, i.e., the action.



As for the lagrange multiplier fields, one
has the freedom of assigning to them any gauge transformation
properties one sees fit, and we may therefore choose to
transform them in such a way as to make the entire action
I_0=I_0^min  -d^5x(_5 _1 +A_5 _2)
gauge invariant.  This can always be arranged
even in the most general cases with second class
constraints , and in our case amounts to
(not surprisingly) setting
_5 = -D_5 _1 +[_2,_5] ,
A_5 = -D_5 _2
 Minimal BRST hamiltonian 


The following considerations are direct consequences of standard
results of homological BRST theory (we refer to  for
details). The extended phase space is introduced by including in the
minimal sector a ghost-antighost conjugate
pair for each of the constraints
 and . Hence we add  for  and
 for , and as the notation indicates, identify
them with the ghost fields in . The
corresponding kinetic terms  are
included in the action. Note the minus
sign in .

By inspection of (), one easily finds the
generator  for  on the extended phase space
Q 
s=-Q, ,   Q = d^4x(_^+
                     c +)
Therefore we have
H_C^min   = -Q,X,
    X =-d^4x[_( ^D_F^ 
    +[^,c]) -  a'^-1 D_(
               ^c)]
A main theorem of BRST theory provides the existence of a
BRST generator  for  which, because  the 
generate a genuine Lie algebra, takes a particularly simple form
Om 
w = -, , &=& d^4x(_1
  - _2 -  [,]
                  -[,])

            & &

            &=& -Q,d^4x(_1
-[,])Thus  is -exact which implies
, as expected.
We remark that in theories where the constraints do not
generate a closed algebra with constant structure functions,
the BRST generator may be much more complicated (an infinite
series expansion in a ghost degree).  So again, we see the
attractive simplicity of this 5- theory.

One needs to construct an appropriate BRST invariant
extension of  and then gauge-fix it.  But  is already
-invariant so the gauge-fixed
BRST hamiltonian corresponding to , as
expressed in terms of this minimal set of fields, is
then simply given by
H^min   = H_C^min   + H^min  _gf  
= -Q,X - , K
where the gauge fixing fermion  , as it
is frequently called, is
chosen to be
K = -Q,f-Q,a^-1 d^4xA =
a^-1 d^4x( A
+ )
From the Jacobi identity and  one has
,K = Q,,f
so  can be written in the compact form
H^min   = -Q,Q,Q =X + ,f
Explicitly one has
-,K &=& a^-1 d^4x(_1- _2A -DD-[^,_])
Thus the BRST hamiltonian in its fully expanded form is
H^min   &=&-Q,Q

             &=&-Q,X - , K

          &=&d^4x-(^2  + _(2[_,c]
                 -D_F^ )
           + _(D_ D^[ ^] 
         +[F^ ,_ ])+[_,^]

           & & + 1 a'  [c(D^2 c-D_^)
    +  (D^2+[D_^,c] + [^,
      2D_c-_])])

     & & +1 a ((D_^              + [,c] -c)              - (D_^+ [_,^] +[c ,c]

     & & DD      -[^,_])Our canonical treatment agrees with because one can easily check that after
integrating out  in the
lagrangian action  [= () + ()] one
gets precisely
I^min   = d^5x(
      A_^+ _^      + cc - +-            -H ^min  )
So in fact, what we have done here is give a consistent constructive
derivation of the (reduced form of) action  based on the
canonical analysis of the constrained hamiltonian.



Propagators 
In this section we study the propagators
and show that all complete ghost (and ghost of ghost)
propagators stay retarded in one-loop
dimensional regularization.  This is an important feature
of bulk quantization and will be key to establishing
the advertised results on correlators ant the
ground state in the next section..

Let us then begin by first computing the free 
propagators
by inverting the quadratic part of the action ,
which is given by the quadratic form
Im2 
_(0)  = -d^5x A^(-_ _5
+ a^-1 __+_ ^tr  )^-^2

+ (_5-a' ^-1 )+ (_5-a' ^-1 )+ (_5-a' ^-1 )

+ ( _,c) 
_ _5 - a^-1 __-_ ^tr   & 0

(a-a')_/aa'            &  _5-a' ^-1 _
 c Here
_ ^tr  =P^tr  
=_ and  and  are
the usual transverse and longitudinal projectors.
They may be defined via their Fourier transforms
(denoted by )
P^tr  _ (p)= _ 
- p_p_ p^2 ,P^lg  _ (p)
= P^tr  _ (p) = p_p_ p^2 .
and provide an orthogonal decomposition


The single blocks are trivial to invert and give the free
momentum space propagators
D  _0, (p)=1 ip_5+p^2/a' ,D  _0, (p)=D  _0, (p)=
1 ip_5+p^2/a 
The  block is also straightforward to invert
(after using integration by parts to generate a lower
left term).  The
non-vanishing transverse free propagators are then
D  _0,A^A^ ^tr  (p)=
2P^tr  _  p_5^2+(p^2)^2 ,D  _0,A^^ ^tr  (p)=
-D  _0,^A^ ^tr  (p)=
2P^tr  _  ip_5+p^2 
Using the Hodge decomposition for vector fields
X_  = X_ ^tr   + _ F
the longitudinal piece is easily inverted as well.
The result is
D  _0,A^A^ ^lg  (p)=
2P^lg  _  p_5^2+(p^2)^2/a^2 ,
D  _0,A^^ ^lg  (p)=
-D  _0,^A^ ^lg  (p)=
2P^lg  _  ip_5+p^2/a ,
D  _0,^^ =0
Note that if  is integrated  out in
,
the correct 4- Yang-Mills propagator is recovered.
The   block similarly gives the following
non-vanishing free propagators
D  _0,^^ ^tr  (p)&=
_  ip_5+p^2 &
D  _0,^^ ^lg  (p)&=
_  ip_5+p^2/a 

D  _0,c^ ^lg  (p)&=a'-a aa' 
p_ (ip_5+p^2/a)(ip_5+p^2/a') &
D  _0,cc (p) &=1 ip_5+p^2/a' 

Upon taking the inverse Fourier transform
D  _0(t,x) = 1 (2)^5  dp_5 e^itp_5 
d^4pe^ixp  D  _0(p_5,p)
one sees
that all the free  propagators for the
ghosts (and ghosts of ghosts)
are retarded, since there is no pole in the upper  half-plane
( and  are positive) and closing the  contour in the
lower half-plane gives .

What about the complete propagators  then?
For motivation consider the
Green's functions  and  (for  say), satisfying
cc 
(_t - a^-1 ^_)G_0(t-s;x-y) &=(s,y)

(_t - a^-1 D^_)G(t-s;x,y;A) &=(s,y)
Of course  is just the free propagator, but
 since
the (time ordered)
correlator involves integration over  as well.
Nevertheless,
it is instructive to look at properties of 
prior to integration.
From Duhamel's principle  we have the
following convolution
relation between  and .

where we have suppressed indices. From this we
see that not only is  automatically retarded as well, but for a
sufficiently regular  one would conclude that
_ts  G(t-s;x,y;A) = _ts  G_0(t-s;x-y) =
(x-y)
The significance is that canonical commutation relations
are formally  satisfied if one assumes
regularity of  and
_ts D (t-s;x,y)_ts G(t-s;x,y;A)=_ts G(t-s;x,y;A)However, one cannot assume this so a separate argument is required
to check the divergent case.
We now proceed to show that the conclusion indeed applies
to  as well, for  by dimensional regularization
at one-loop level. This amounts to evaluating diagrams like this one,
which is the first-order correction to the free  propagator

Expressing the denominators as parameter integrals

one obtains after some computation the following expression

              [(1-)p^2+iEa]^(iE+p^2/a)^2 
where  and we have taken the inverse Fourier
transform in .
Using parameter integrals again and integrating gives

_0^1dx x  x^(1-x) e^-p^2t a(1+a) x 
 being cancelled by writing

e^-p^2t/a p^2t a(1+a) [
1  +1-t a(1+a)  +O(t)]
and so .

Since (apart from
the gauge parameters  and ) all the ghost propagators
except  are of the same
form it is clear that these considerations also apply to them.  And
if one rewrites  as
p_ p^2 (1 ip_5+p^2/a' 
-1 ip_5+p^2/a )
it is not difficult to see that the result will be true here as well.
Thus our conclusion applies to all ghost propagators.

Ground State 

We now turn to the ground state   of the theory.
It is the zero eigenvector of the hamiltonian
HP=0
normalized to be a probability density, ,
where  is a functional measure determined
below and  is an appropriate operator form of
.
In this section we will show that  is just the ground state
of the Fokker-Planck hamiltonian.
Also, by showing that
the equal time limit of correlators of the 5- theory agrees
with the corresponding expectation value with respect to ,
we will use this to
establish equivalence between the hamiltonian
and bulk lagrangian quantization.

We take the operator representation
of the fields to be
^(x) =  A_(x) ,^(x)= _(x) ,
(x) =  (x) ,etc. 
with all ghosts  acting as functional derivatives with respect
to the corresponding antighosts  (similarly for ghosts of ghosts).
Due to signs, we must choose 
and . This achieves the correspondence
between the graded operator commutator and graded bracket via
-8pt 
,,Recall that 
still denotes the Lie algebra (not operator) commutator.

In this representation correlators of operators  are
computed by integrating over  with weight , where
 is the measure obtained after integrating out all ghosts in
A cc ()
That the result is of the form
DM

M & = A(A)
 
cc ()()

 & = A (A)

can be seen as follows. (Note that the second equality
is simply the fact that in fermionic calculus

First, integrate out .  This
contributes
 ^-1 (_5-D) ()
and therefore
kills the cubic term .
Then integrate out  which contributes

The determinants cancel, the  quartet
dependence is gone from , and the contribution
to  is
()
Now for the rest of the measure, as  is quadratic
in , one can integrate  out to obtain

)
where
I_red  
=-d^5x(_tA_1 a D_A

 but with the full -dependence kept in the operators
ccl 
A _  &=& _ _5-1 a D__          +1 a _  -[F_ ,]

B _  &=& 2[A_               -D^F_ ,] 

C _  &=& 1 a _1 a' D_ 

D        &=& _5 -1 a' D^2
                  +1 a [A,] 
and the cubic and quartic ghost interactions are collected in
 ' =d^5x(
-1 a [,c]
+1 a' [D_^,c]
-1 a' [^,_]

+[_,^]+2 a [^,D_c]
-[^,c][_,c])

Now observe that
A _  & B _& 0

           C _&   D    & 0

                   0        &     0       & D   = t -L_0()+L_int  (A)
is a perturbation of the parabolic operator
 by .
Let's ignore the ghost interactions  for the moment.
Since 

is retarded one can use the arguments of to expand
rl 
( t -L_0+L_int  (A))
&=Tr (+G_0L_int  (A))

&=Tr (L_int  G_0
      -L_int  G_0L_int  G_0+)
and only the -dependent 'tadpole'
 survives.
One sees that integrating out  will generate
just delta functions of  times
the -dependent tadpole term.
Including the ghost interactions into  gives a
ghost-dependent tadpole, which we ignore.

The upshot is that indeed, after including the
 component,
the measure must be of form (), where
 involves  (and tadpoles).
This is not surprising for a measure that ought to
give non-trivial results for quantities with zero ghost number.
We shall not attempt to investigate  in detail, but
we expect that after restriction to a time slice it
will generate .

Since  the hamiltonian preserves ghost
number. (The actual form, i.e., operator ordering, of 
will be dealt with below and is irrelevant for now.)
 Thus, when  is expanded in ghost degree
 
P=_j (j) P ,((j) P )=j
each component solves the equation separately
H (j) P =0
But because the measure  kills terms with non-zero
ghost number
one has

MP=M(0) P 

so only  contributes and we impose the
condition that the ground state is independent of the antighosts 
P=(0) P =(0) P (A)
in agreement with the remark above regarding  and .
Also, since  only depends on  it follows that it must
satisfy
QP=P=0
where  and  are obtained from () and
() by replacing all ghosts and 
by derivatives.

We now come to operator ordering.  Propagators are time ordered
correlators, so for any fields  one has
T_1(x)_2(y)= (x_5-y_5)_1(x)
_2(y)+ (-)^(_1)(_2) (y_5-x_5)
_2(y)_1(x)But we have determined that the full ghost
propagators are retarded, i.e., proportional to the  function,
so one has for the - propagator, for example
cc 
(x_5-y_5)T(x)(y)= (x_5-y_5)(x)(y)-(y_5-x_5)(y)(x)

(y)(x)=0
and similarly for the other ghosts (and ghosts of ghosts).
One then has agreement with the hamiltonian representation
_t0 (t +t,x)
(t,y)=(x-y)=A (x) (y)P(A)
Similarly for the - correlator one has
_t0 (t +t,x)
(t,y)=(x-y)=A()
 (x) (y)P(A)
and so on.  So the effective hamiltonian ordering prescription is
the time ordering.
All fields  go to the right , that is
all derivative operators to the left.
One readily checks that this
is consistent with the - propagator as well.

Finally, noting that  is
ordered to the left in  we find that  solves
the Fokker-Planck equation
H_FP  (A)P(A) -d^4x  A^(x) 
[ A_(x)  -K^(x;A)]P(A)=0,

K^(x;A)D_F^ (x) +a^-1 D^A(x)
=S_YM   A_(x)  +a^-1 D^ A(x)
since  is effectively equal to precisely
 when
acting on functionals of  only.  Of course the above considerations
do not preclude degeneracy, i.e., we have not proven uniqueness
here.















Conclusion 
We treated the bulk-quantized gauge theory
as a constrained gauge system and
found that the canonical analysis of what happen to be particularly
simple constraints leads directly to a BRST gauge-fixed hamiltonian
and a corresponding action that agrees with (a reduced form of)
the bulk action  arrived at in the lagrangian
formulation.  The hamiltonian is -exact and -closed
H^min   = -Q,Q= -Q,X+f
The lagrange multiplier fields for fixing the gauge were not
included among the canonical variables
(which we consider inconvenient
due to a larger gauge algebra), but we made some
elementary observations about how one may in principle
proceed with inclusion of the lagrange multipliers
in the phase space.

By dimensionally regularizing the
self-energy one-loop correction to a
representative ghost propagator we have concluded that
the complete propagators for all ghosts (and ghosts of ghosts)
are indeed retarded.
Consequently we found that the ground state  depends on  only
and is in fact just the
ground state of the Fokker-Planck hamiltonian .
We have also displayed the consistency of the hamiltonian
formulation at the quantum level in that expectation
values with respect to the ground state  are compatible with the
expectation values with respect to the 5- action .

Interesting questions to consider in the future may be
renormalization of the equal-time theory governed by the
Fokker-Planck equation and relation thereof to the
renormalization of the 5- theory governed by .

Appendix A: Nonminimal approach 

In our opinion, the nonminimal treatment, which is based on a
larger action
I_0^E = I_0 -_j=1 ^4u^j_j with more constraints and a larger phase space,
does not lend itself to convenient quantization for the following
reasons.
As we shall see below, the gauge algebra contains 4 independent
 parameters (which we may reduce to 2 by hand).
Therefore the BRST implementation of the
nonminimal gauge symmetry would necessarily
involve 2 extra conjugate ghost pairs
(in addition to  and
).  Then one would need to find a proper gauge fixing
fermion  that would give the same action as  (after
integrating out the extra fields).  Given the already
imposing field content of the theory one would want to avoid
bringing in more fields. In addition,
the identification of all the ghosts associated with constraints
with the ghosts in the lagrangian action 
may become tenuous since such
identifications depend on the particular
gauge fixing.  For the minimal case the situation was
quite simple regarding these issues, hence our choice.
Nevertheless, in case there is further interest in the
nonminimal direction, for completeness we include here
a brief discussion of how one may approach the nonminimal
treatment.

Since  is already in first order form we can write
I_0 = d^5x ( A_^+ _^        + cc - - H _C )
where  can be written out explicitly, but we don't
need it now. We can immediately read off the canonical momenta
_A_ I_0 A_  =^,
 __ I_0 _  =^,
 _c I_0 c  =c,
_ I_0   =so there is no need to introduce independent momenta for these
fields.  There are thus two vanishing momenta
_5I_0 A_  =0,
 _5I_0 _  =0
One can then add the kinetic terms for  and 
and constrain them to
zero by means of lagrange multipliers to obtain
uham 
I_0' = d^5x ( A_^+ A_5^5 +
_^+ _5^5
        + cc - - H _C
                       - u^1_1 - u^2_2 )
where
_1_5and  _2_5=s_1
are the primary constraints and the  are new
lagrange multiplier fields.

Now, however,  generates two secondary
constraints
_3D_^+ [,c] -c  and  
_4 D_^+ [_,^] +[c ,c]
+ [,] = s_3
and these are precisely  from the minimal treatment.
So the constraints  and  are
now secondary.  We find the following Lie algebra
alg2  _3^a(x),_4^b(y) &= (x-y)f^ab _ c  _3^c(y) 

 _4^a(x),_4^b(y) &= (x-y)f^ab _ c  _4^c(y) 

               rest  &= 0
which is similar to (). One finds
,
thus there are no tertiary constraints.  As before,
all the constraints are irreducible.

Before we take a look at how the fields actually transform under
gauge transformations, we notice that the constraints  may be
replaced by a new set of constraints, given by a linear
combination of the old, , provided
that the matrix  is invertible, so that the new 
are still irreducible.  Therefore it is permissible to define
 _1 =_1, & _3
                _3-[_5,A_5],

 _2 = _2, & _4 _4
           +[_5,_5] +[A_5,_5] = s _3
The algebra of the  is slightly
different from ()
alg3  _1^a(x),_4^b(y) = (x-y)f^ab _ c  _1^c(y)
   &  _2^a(x),_4^b(y) =
                       (x-y)f^ab _ c  _2^c(y)

 _2^a(x),_3^b(y) = (x-y)f^ab _ c  _1^c(y)
   &  _3^a(x),_4^b(y) =
                       (x-y)f^ab _ c  _3^c(y)

 _4^a(x),_4^b(y) = (x-y)f^ab _ c  _4^c(y)
       &        rest  = 0
Note again that the action of  on the left-hand column
gives the right-hand column.
The  and  generate new gauge
transformations
on the  quartet, while the rest
of the fields transform the same way.  We list the non-trivial
gauge transformations

Let us now deal with the  integral
dE 2 e^iEt/a

after rescaling .  Clearly this integral is
finite for .  We Taylor expand the integrand in  and

The remainder  consists of terms constant and higher

&=&3/2 (32)^2 
e^-p^2t/a p^2t a(1+a) [
1  +1-t a(1+a)  +O(t)]
which is proportional to . Apparently the  pole generates a
time renormalization counterterm, but we will not address the
details of renormalizing the theory here.  What is important is
that the correction vanishes as .
