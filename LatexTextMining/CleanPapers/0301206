Abstract  
Supersymmetric backgrounds in string and M-theory 
of the Universe type are studied. 
We find several new Universes that 
preserve up to 20 supersymmetries.
In particular, we obtain an interesting Universe in M-theory with 18 
supersymmetries
which does not seem to be dual to a pp-wave.
We show that not only T-duality but also the 
type-IIA/M-theory 
S-duality can give supersymmetric Universes from pp-waves.
We find solutions that can interpolate between Universes and pp-waves.
We also compute
the string spectrum on two type IIA Universes. Furthermore, we  
obtain
the spectrum of D-branes on a Universe and find
the supergravity solution for a D4-brane on a Universe.












Introduction 


Many of the great breakthroughs in string theory in the past 
few years are tied to studying string theory on 
supersymmetric backgrounds with Ramond-Ramond fields.
Some of the most notable backgrounds include 
D-branes,  
 and, 
more recently, pp-waves with Ramond-Ramond fluxes 
.

Recently, a new type of supersymmetric background
with Ramond-Ramond fluxes has been found. In 
 an M-theory solution
of the Universe type was found to preserve 20
supersymmetries.
(Supersymmetric Universes in compactified string theory
have been found in. These
solutions are not Universes when uplifted to ten-dimensional
string theory.)  
This solution has Ramond-Ramond fluxes
when compactified to type IIA string theory.
The fact that it is of the Universe
type means that it has closed time-like curves.
In, it was described that the
principle of Holography perhaps can remedy the problem of
closed time-like curves and protect the chronology in
Universe backgrounds. 
Furthermore, in, it was shown that the 
Universe background of is T-dual to a 
pp-wave.
(This T-duality was also discussed inbut the connection to pp-waves was not considered.)  
This discovery gives a reason for the otherwise mysterious
existence of supersymmetric Universes in that we can connect
them to already known solutions of string theory.


Originally the universe 
(see for an excellent review) is defined as a
pressure-free perfect fluid solution in General Relativity with 
negative cosmological constant. The four dimensional 
metric in polar coordinates is given by
ds^2=-dt^2+d^2+^2  (1-^2 )d^2
-22  ^2  dt d+ dz^2.We see that we have closed time-like curves for constant  with
. Thus, the closed time-like curves cannot 
be arbitrarily small. The Universe is also seen to be 
homogenous and to have a trivial topology.
On the other hand, for supersymmetric backgrounds of the Universe
type in string theory 
and M-theory, a typical example of a metric is
 
as a part of the ten or eleven-dimensional space-time.
Despite the different looking metric these supersymmetric
solutions still share the essential properties of the original
Universe. 
Indeed this background is also homogenous, it has trivial topology,
(Here we only mean the 3 dimensional part newgodel .
The remaining directions in string or M-theory
could be topologically non-trivial.)  
and we have closed time-like curves when . 



In this paper we lay some of the ground work for a better understanding
of Universes in string and M-theory. 
We first consider different ways of obtaining new Universes,
and provide several new supersymmetric Universe backgrounds.
We find that not only T-duality, but also the type-IIA/M-theory
S-duality can produce Universes from pp-waves. 
We find the Universes  
in M-theory with most supersymmetry. In particular, 
this includes a  solution
with 18 supersymmetries, which is not related to the known background
by T-duality. 
We also find that there exist three inequivalent Universes
with 20 supersymmetries. In this consideration we note a subtlety in 
the T-duality of on the maximally supersymmetric
type IIB pp-wave 
which means that we can get two inequivalent 
type IIA Universes, one with 20 supersymmetries
and one without supersymmetry.
Furthermore, we study two one-parameter families
of backgrounds which 
have the interesting feature that they interpolate between a Universe
and a pp-wave.

We go on to study the string spectrum of the supersymmetric 
type IIA Universe 
which is dual to the type IIB pp-wave
with maximal supersymmetry.
To do this we use the fact that this pp-wave solution can be quantized
in the light-cone gauge. We generalize the 
spectrum to include the compact direction on which we T-dualize
and thereby obtain the spectrum on the Universe background.
We also find the spectrum for the type IIA Universe
which is S-dual to the M-theory 
Universe of.

Finally, we study D-branes on type IIA Universes. We 
consider the boundary conditions and find the spectrum of D-branes.
We also find a new supergravity solution for a D4-brane on a Universe and uplift this to a new M5-brane solution on an M-theory
pp-wave.




Universes in String and M-theory 

In this section we consider the possible supersymmetric Universes
in string and M-theory. We first consider the different ways of
obtaining supersymmetric Universe solutions, either by 
T or S-dualizing
a supersymmetric pp-wave solution, or by directly looking for solutions
to the equations of motion and the Killing spinor equation. 
Then we go on to consider various new supersymmetric
Universes and in particular we present the Universes 
 of M-theory for 
with most supersymmetry. 




Universes from pp-waves by T-duality 

As shown in it is possible to find Universe
backgrounds of type IIA/B string theory by T-dualizing 
type IIA/B pp-wave solutions. We explain here how this works in
general since we use this transformation repeatedly in the following.

Consider here a pp-wave metric of the form 

 

with . Our light-cone coordinates are defined by
 and .

We assume here and in the following that we do not have NS-NS
flux turned on in this pp-wave background. In Section we give an
example where the NS-NS flux can hinder that we get a Universe
after T-duality. 

We now do the coordinate transformation

 

In the new coordinate system we have 

 

where we defined

 

We see now that  is an explicit space-like isometry of the 
metric aftercoII . We can therefore do a
T-duality along . This gives the metric 

 

and the NS-NS 2-form potential  and 3-form field strength


 

See Appendix  for our T-duality conventions.
Clearly, the metric metgodelII  is of the Universe type,
i.e. it has closed time-like curves and a trivial topology,
and for  and  the metric is the same as for the Universe
backgrounds found
in.

For any Universe background that we consider in this paper
the time-space components of the metric , where  runs
over all spatial directions (in Cartesian coordinates), 
can asymptotically be written as
. This gives the general definition
of the antisymmetric matrix . Also, we define
 as being the rank of , i.e.  is the minimal
number of directions in which we can write the non-zero part of .



Universes from M-theory pp-waves by S-duality 

In this section we note that we can obtain Universe backgrounds
by S-dualizing M-theory pp-waves. This is thus another way than
T-duality that pp-waves and Universe backgrounds are dual.
In Section  we explain that the T- and S-dualities
can be mapped to each other when .

Consider the M-theory pp-wave metric 

 

with . For later convenience
we define here our light-cone coordinates by 
 and .
Do now the coordinate transformation genct . This gives
the metric

 

where  is as in genJij . Clearly we have
an explicit space-like isometry in the  direction and
can therefore get the corresponding type IIA string theory
solution by compactifying this direction. 
We summarize the M/IIA S-duality rules in Appendix .
Using the relation 

 

we get the ten-dimensional metric

 

along with the gauge fields  and the two-form Ramond-Ramond
(RR) field strength


 

As we see from the metric we have thus obtained a 
Universe background of type IIA string theory. In other words,
the strong coupling limit of the type IIA Universe is given by
the pp-wave in M-theory.
(Resolution of closed time-like curves by dimensional oxidation 
was also considered in.
In these cases the solutions were lifted from compactified string theory
to ten-dimensional string theory backgrounds.) 
We use this S-duality below to find new supersymmetric Universe
backgrounds of string and M-theory. 



Construction of M-theory Universes 

An alternative approach to get supersymmetric
Universes instead of using T and S-dualities is to directly
find solutions of the equations of motions (EOMs) that
have supersymmetry. In this section we give the necessary tools
to do this for Universes in M-theory.
(See also for
general conditions on supersymmetric Universe backgrounds.)  
These tools make a systematic study of supersymmetric Universes possible.
As we shall see in Section , 
this approach can provide solutions
that we could not otherwise have obtained by use of dualities.

Ricci tensor for Universes 

We consider a  Universe with metric

 

where  are constants that characterize the metric.

First note that this metric is in polar coordinates contrary
to the metric of sections  and .
To put the metrics of these sections in this form we should
perform the coordinate transformation

 

In the rest of this paper we shall always use this coordinate 
transformation when going between the Cartesian and polar coordinates.

Moreover, note that we are restricting ourselves to a special type
of Universe metrics which is characterized by having
 proportional to  since this seems to be the
right type of metrics to get supersymmetric Universes.

The non-zero components of the Ricci tensor for the metric
metgodeln  are

 

We note that curvature scalar is

 

Using riccin  one can write down the Einstein equations relating
the background fluxes to the geometry. We conduct this 
for M-theory Universes
in the following.


Equations of motion for M-theory Universes 

The bosonic part of 11 dimensional supergravity is

 

with . This gives the Einstein equations

 

The equations of motion and Bianchi identity for the four-form field
strength are

 

We now consider the following ansatz for M-theory 
Universes

 

 

with ,  and  a symmetric constant matrix
with . Thus we have ten independent constants in .
The  are constants that 
we can take to be positive without loss of generality. 
To obtain a  universe
one can put  and the other
 non-zero.

We should also note that this is not the most general
ansatz one can have for supersymmetric Universes in M-theory.
Indeed, in Section  we give two examples of supersymmetric
solutions that does not fit into the above ansatz. However, 
we believe that all the M-theory Universes
with maximal supersymmetry, for a given , should fit
into the above ansatz.

We first consider the Einstein equations. Define 

 

Then the non-zero components of  are

 

By considering all the Einstein equations we can now see
that all EOMs are satisfied if

 

or, equivalently, if

 

Note that as consequence of equation getci  the 's 
are uniquely determined by giving the  matrix, since 
we imposed that .

Consider now the two remaining equations fseqs . 
The Bianchi identity is trivially fulfilled. The equations of
motion for the field strength can be written as

 

where  (we denote the eleventh
coordinate by ). Using that
 we get that fseom 
is satisfied if
(The factor of  on the RHS is present because this means
that e.g. 
.) 

 

where

 

Thus, for a given collection of  and  
the EOMs of M-theory reduce to the equations getci  
and eomfromfs . 
Since getci  determines
the  uniquely, we can see eomfromfs  as a condition
that a given  matrix should fulfil in order to correspond
to a solution.

Note that if we start with the 's given, we can try to solve
for . Since we have ten independent components of 
and ten independent equations getbi  and eomfromfs  
this looks possible. This is not the case, however, there can be 
many different matrices  giving the same 's.


For use in the rest of the paper, we introduce here 
a shorthand expression for a given Universe solution 

 

that specifies uniquely an M-theory Universe background.




Supersymmetry conditions for M-theory Universes 

To count the number of supersymmetries of a classical 
solution in M-theory, we need
to count the number of independent spinors  that obey the 
Killing spinor equation

 

with 
. The Gamma-matrices  are for the 
curved space, while  are for the tangent space. 

For our ansatz metgodel5 -fsansatz  it is convinient
to classify constant spinors according to their eigenvalues under the
matrices

 

Here the Gamma matrices are for the tangent space. 
The eigenvalues of  are .
Then since we impose 
we have the constraint

 

Thus, we can classify constant spinors
according to their eigenvalues of .
Note that any eigenvalue of  has degeneracy two.

Our ansatz for a Killing spinor obeying
killspin  is

 

where  is a constant spinor with
eigenvalues  of .
The Gamma matrices in this expression are flat.
The Killing spinor equation killspin  then becomes

 

for the time-component, and 

 

 

for the spatial components. This reduces now to the equations

 

provided we take

 

In conclusion,
the number of supersymmetries for a given
choice of  and  is given by two times the 
number of solutions to susycount  when trying the 16 possible
choices of .




Symmetries of the ansatz 

We can also consider the possible symmetries of the ansatz
metgodel5 -fsansatz  for a given Universe solution. 
I.e. for given  and , what general transformations
can give  and
 that also solves the EOMs getci 
and eomfromfs , and have the same amount of supersymmetry 
(which is computed from susycount ). We have 
three basic transformations
that map solutions to solutions keeping the same amount of supersymmetry.

The first one is that we can rescale the  and , i.e.
the transformation is 
 and  
with .

The second one is that we interchange two of the five different two-planes.
If we for example exchange the 12-plane and 34-plane we should make
the transformation 
, 
, 
 
and 
, 
, 
 with .

The third transformation is that we can change parity in one of the
planes. If we for example change parity in the -plane we 
should make the transformation
, 
and
,
 
with .



Solutions with  and  



 Universes 

In an
 Universe background of M-theory with 20 supersymmetries
was found. In this was shown to be T-dual
to a pp-wave with 24 supersymmetries. We review this briefly and
put the T-duality into a broader picture involving also the
S-duality transformation of Section .

In the Penrose limit of 
from intersecting D3-branes was found to be the type IIB pp-wave background
with the metric

 

and the RR fields

 

We see the metric corresponds to  in Section .
After the T-duality transformation of Section  we get
the Universe background of type IIA

 

 

with .
Lifting to M-theory we get the  Universe
background

 

 

where . 
This M-theory Universe background has 20 supersymmetries
.
(Notice that the number of supersymmetries 
can be changed under T-duality as we examine in Appendix .) 
In our notation of Section we can write this solution as

 

If we T-dualize the pp-wave background 
metppintD3 -fluxppintD3  in the  and  directions
we have the same metric but the RR fields are given by

 

This type IIB pp-wave with 24 supersymmetries can be obtained from 
a Penrose limit of 
 from the D1-D5 system 
. 
If we do the T-duality of Section we get the Universe 
metric G5IIA  and the NS-NS and RR fields

 

This Universe background of type IIA has also 20 supersymmetries.
Indeed this Universe background is related by T-dualities in the
 and  directions to the background 
G5IIA -fluxG5IIA .

We now uplift the type IIA Universe G5IIA ,
fluxG5IIA2  to M-theory. We call  and the eleventh
direction . We then get

 

 

This is an M-theory pp-wave solution with 24 supersymmetries, obtained from
a Penrose limit in. 
We see that we have connected the type IIA Universe G5IIA ,
fluxG5IIA2  to the M-theory pp-wave
metmpp24 -fluxmpp24  by the S-duality transformation
described in Section .



 
Diagram that shows connection between T and S-duality
transformations relating Universes and pp-waves.   



We can now demonstrate that the T-duality transformation of
Section  and the S-duality transformation of
Section  in fact are equivalent when
we have at least two flat directions, i.e. when  for
the Universes. 
Consider the M-theory pp-wave metmpp24 -fluxmpp24 .
Compactify now this on  in the ,  and the  directions.
We have then illustrated in Figure  a duality chain that
connects the T-duality of Section  and the S-duality of
Section . 
Starting from the M-theory pp-wave metmpp24 -fluxmpp24 
we can S-dualize along  to obtain the type IIA pp-wave
which comes from a Penrose limit of 
F1-NS5 with 24 supersymmetries. 
This we can T-dualize 
along  to obtain the F1-NS5 pp-wave in type IIB. Using
type IIB S-duality we arrive at the D1-D5 pp-wave 
metppintD3 , fluxppD1D5 . Then we do the T-duality
of Section  along  to obtain 
the type IIA Universe G5IIA , fluxG5IIA2 .
Finally, we end up with the M-theory pp-wave 
metmpp24 -fluxmpp24  by uplift to M-theory.
In conclusion we have shown that for 
the T and S-duality that
relate pp-waves to Universes are equivalent for M-theory on .



 Universe/pp-wave mixture 

It is interesting to consider the mixed pp-wave background
of type IIB with 
metric metppintD3  and NS-NS and RR three form fluxes

 

This background has 24 supersymmetries. 
We now T-dualize this according to Section with . We subsequently do two trivial T-dualities along
 and , and then make a trivial uplift to M-theory.
The resulting M-theory background is

 

 

where  and  is the eleventh direction.

This solution is interesting for several reasons. If we consider
the special case  it reduces to the
M-theory  Universe metn2M -fluxn2M .
On the other hand, if we consider the case 
it becomes an M-theory pp-wave with 24 supersymmetries.
The solution metn2mix -fluxn2mix  thus interpolates
between being a Universe and a pp-wave.

Moreover, we see that for  we have an example of a 
supersymmetric pp-wave solution with NS-NS flux that does not
become a Universe background after the T-duality of
Section .

In general the solution metn2mix -fluxn2mix  has 
16 supersymmetries while, as we just saw, it has 20 supersymmetries 
when  and 24 supersymmetries when .
We give a proof of the 16 supersymmetries of the solution
in Appendix .

Note that the solution metn2mix -fluxn2mix 
does not fit into the ansatz metgodel5 -fsansatz 
since the  and the  components are non-zero.
This is of course in accordance with the fact that the solution
metn2mix -fluxn2mix  can describe both a pp-wave and
a Universe.

To understand better the interpolation between Universe and pp-wave
we write the metric metn2mix  in polar coordinates

 

If we consider for example the 12-plane, we see that for 
the curve  it is a closed space-like curve
for  and a closed
time-like curve for .
If we now consider the limit  we see
that the necessary radius to make a closed time-like curves goes
to infinity. So if  is very small but non-zero the geometry is
almost that of a pp-wave and the radii of the closed time-like curves
are so large that they effectively can be ignored. 
It would
be interesting to study how the holographic sheets 
behave in this limit.





 Universes 


In it was pointed out that 
the maximally supersymmetric pp-wave of
type IIB 
can be T-dualized into an  Universe solution.
In the following we examine this T-duality carefully 
and study its supersymmetry. We find that the T-duality can
give two inequivalent  Universes. We then
go on to discuss a more general type of pp-wave solution and
the consequences this solution have for the relation between
the T and S-dualities of Sections  and .
In particular we find a new Universe with 20 supersymmetries.

Consider the maximally symmetric pp-wave of type IIBwith metric

 

and RR flux

 

We see that the metric corresponds to 
 in Section . 
However, we shall see in the following that the signs of the 's
become important. Without loss of generality we therefore choose
 and , where .

We consider now the T-duality of Section . 
We get the metric

 

with 
and .
The NS-NS and RR fluxes are

 

As we shall see below, this defines two inequivalent 
 type IIA Universe backgrounds, corresponding to .

We can now uplift these solutions to M-theory. This gives the 
M-theory Universes 

 

 

with  as usual. In our short hand notation of 
Section  we can write the solutions as

 

Using the methods in Section it is now easy to compute that the number of supersymmetries is
zero if  and 20 if .
For the detail of Killing spinors see () in the Appendix B.
This is obviously also true for the type IIA Universes
metn4iia1 -fluxn4iia1 . We also computed the 20
supersymmetries of the  type IIA solution in an alternative way in
Appendix .
We denote the  M-theory Universe as .

If we want to write down the  solution with  we note that
using the parity changing 
transformation of Section  we get the
equivalent solution

 

with 20 supersymmetries.

We now go on to study a one-parameter 
type IIB pp-wave solution with 28 supersymmetries and its dual type IIA
and M-theory Universe. As we shall see, this illustrates
that the T and S dualities in Section
 and  are not equivalent for . 
It also has other interesting features.

The type IIB pp-wave solution with 28 supersymmetries(see also) has metric

 

and RR fluxes

 

 is the parameter of the solution.
When  we regain the maximally supersymmetric pp-wave of type IIB
. When  
we get a type IIB pp-wave with 28 
supersymmetries found in.

We now take the T-duality in Section . 
 From the  case above we know that to get a supersymmetric
solution we should take .
The T-duality then gives the type IIA Universe background

 

with 

and .
The NS-NS and RR fluxes are

 

This type IIA Universe solution has generically 12 supersymmetries,
(see Appendix  for a proof of this).
In the two special cases  and  it has
instead 20 supersymmetries (see Appendix  for the
 case). Therefore we see that we have two different
 Universes of type IIA with
20 supersymmetries which are not related by dualities.


We now uplift the solution metn4iia2 -fluxn4iia2 
to M-theory. We get the M-theory background with metric

 

and four-form fluxes

 

where we denote  and  is the eleventh direction.
This solution has many common features with the 
 Universe/pp-wave mixture metn2mix -fluxn2mix .
For  it reduces to the
M-theory Universe metn4M1 -fluxn4M1 .
For 
it becomes an M-theory pp-wave with 22 supersymmetries
which was found in.
Thus, the solution interpolates between a Universe and a
pp-wave, just as metn2mix -fluxn2mix  does.
The structure of the metrics and fluxes are clearly also of the same
form.

The solution metn4M2 -fluxn4M2  has in general 
12 supersymmetries while it clearly has 20 supersymmetries 
when  and 22 supersymmetries when 
(see Appendix  for a proof of this).

Finally we note that 
if we set  we can illustrate that we do not have
any equivalence
between the T and S-dualities of Sections  and ,
in the sense of the duality chain depicted in 
Figure , for . For  
metpp28 -fluxpp28  describes a type IIB pp-wave with
28 supersymmetries. The T-duality of Section gives the type IIA Universe
metn4iia2 -fluxn4iia2  with 20 supersymmetries.
Uplifting this to M-theory by the S-duality of Section  
gives an M-theory pp-wave with 22 supersymmetries. Thus, clearly 
the two pp-wave solutions related to the type IIA Universe
cannot be related via any trivial dualities since they do not have the
same amount of supersymmetry. 




Solutions with  and  

 Universes 

To find an  Universe, we start with the type IIB
pp-wave solution

 

 

which is the Penrose limit of a D5-brane.
This pp-wave has 16 supersymmetries and is S-dual to the Nappi-Witten
model, which is the 
Penrose limit of an NS5-brane.

 We then do the T-duality of
Section  with . 
This gives the type IIA Universe

 

 

Clearly this becomes a pp-wave when uplifted to M-theory, it in fact
becomes a pp-wave which is directly related to the pp-wave of 
metppd5 -fluxppd5 .
If we instead T-dualize the above type IIA solution along  and   
then we can trivially uplift this to M-theory and
we get the M-theory Universe

 

where we put  and  is the eleventh direction. 
The  Universe 
metgodeln1  has 8 supersymmetries.
We can write the solution as

 

in the notation of Section .



 Universes 

Using the general formulas in we can construct the 
following M-theory pp-wave background with 20 supersymmetries

 

 

If we perform an S-duality along  and the T-duality in
Section  with  and 
we get the type IIB Universe

 

 

with  and .
We now do a T-duality along  and then we uplift the solution
to M-theory. This gives the M-theory background

 

 

with  and  the eleventh direction.
This  universe in M-theory preserves 
14 supersymmetries. We can write the solution as

 




Solutions with  

We consider here M-theory Universes with . 
These backgrounds cannot be related to pp-waves in the same way
as for the  Universes. To find these backgrounds
we have therefore instead used the methods of Section .
The basic method used was to search through the possible 's
with . However, using these results as
input we have been able to find an 
solution with 18 supersymmetries and moreover a quite general family of 
solutions with at least 16 supersymmetries.

Consider the following Universe background

 

This is an  Universe with 18 supersymmetries.
We denote it . We believe that this is the only possible
 Universe
with 18 supersymmetries, up to symmetries of the 
ansatz, and that it is not possible to
find an  Universe with more supersymmetry.
The metric and four-form flux are

 

 

with  and . 
In Appendix  we give the explicit expressions for the
Killing spinors of this background.

The  solution G11  is actually part of a family
of solutions

 

This solution preserves at least 16 supersymmetries for any .
We see that it reduces to G11  for .
Using the symmetries of the ansatz of Section we can in fact transform almost  into the following 
general solution

 

with  and .
The general solution generalcase  preserves at least
16 supersymmetries.
In fact all the  solutions with at least
16 supersymmetries that we have found can fit into generalcase .
It is therefore natural to conjecture that 
any M-theory  Universe with at least 16 supersymmetries is a
special case of generalcase . We do not have a proof of this
at present.

We can also consider the special values of  and  which give
more than 16 supersymmetries for generalcase .
For  we have  and 32 supersymmetries, for
 or  we have  and 20 supersymmetries, 
for  we have  and 20 supersymmetries 
and finally for  or  we have  and 18 supersymmetries.

However, not all solutions of the ansatz
metgodel5 -fsansatz  which have at least
16 supersymmetries are special cases of generalcase . 
A counter-example is the  Universe

 

which preserves 16 supersymmetries. 

We have also found several  Universe solutions with
less than 16 supersymmetries. We have studied all solutions
of the ansatz metgodel5 -fsansatz 
with  and . Of these we have found
one solution with 18 supersymmetries, being G11 ,
several solutions with 16 supersymmetries all of which are special cases 
of generalcase , 
several solutions with 12 and 14 supersymmetries
and one solution without supersymmetry. Altogether we found 43 solutions.
We show here a list of five of these solutions.

 




String Theory on Universes 

In this section we compute the string spectrum
for two Universe background of type IIA string theory. 
Our method is to consider the corresponding type IIB pp-wave background,
compactified on a circle of radius ,
and quantize the string theory in the light-cone gauge. 
Then we take the limit  and obtain
the spectrum in the type IIA Universe. 
We consider mainly the  Universe 
metn4iia1 -fluxn4iia1 
 T-dual to the maximally
supersymmetric pp-wave metmaxpp -fluxmaxpp , 
but also the  Universe
G5IIA -fluxG5IIA  T-dual to the pp-wave
metppintD3 -fluxppintD3  is briefly considered.




String Spectrum on compactified pp-wave 

In this section we 
compute the string spectrum in the compactified maximally 
supersymmetric type IIB pp-wave background
metmaxpp -fluxmaxpp 
in the coordinate system of aftercoII .
Since we are only interested in the
supersymmetric case we choose .

We consider first the bosonic fields in the world-sheet theory
alone.
The light-cone gauge is defined by (see e.g.
)
X^+ (,)=2p^++2wR   (0),
where  is the winding number along the compactified circle. The momentum
is quantized as follows
p^+ = E+m R ,  p^- = E 2 -m 2R 
   (mZ ).
with  and .
The world-sheet action in the light-cone gauge is given by
S=1 dd[_+ X^i_- X^i
-'p^+ J_ij X^i_ X^j +wR J_ij X^i_ X^j
],
where we defined .
It is also useful to employ the complex fields
Z^1 =X^1+iX^2,  Z^2 =X^3+iX^4,   Z^3 =X^5+iX^6,   Z^4 =X^7-iX^8.
The EOMs is given by
(_ ^2-_ ^2) Z^a=4ip^+ _ Z^a
-4iwR _ Z^a.     (a=1,2,3,4)
If we perform the field redefinition
Z^a=Z^a_0 e^2ip^++2i^a wR 
(=Z^a_0 e^iX^+ ),
then we can write the EOMs as
(_ ^2-_ ^2) Z^a_0+4f^2 Z^a_0=0,
where we defined
f=(p^+)^2-(wR)^2 .
The boundary condition for  is given by
Z^a_0(,+)=e^-2iwR Z^a_0(,). The fields  thus obey the same EOMs as in the
usual maximally supersymmetric IIB pp-wave.
However, it is important to notice that they
obey the twisted boundary condition tbc .
The mode expansion is given by ()
Z^a_0&=&
i2  _nZ  
(^a_n+  ^+_n  
e^-2i^+_n  ^a_n-  ^-_n  e^-2i
^-_n +2i(n-) ),

Z ^a_0&=&
i2  _nZ  
( ^a_n-  ^-_n  
e^-2i^-_n   ^a_n+  ^+_n  
e^-2i^+_n +2i(n+) ),
where we defined
 
 


We consider now the light-cone gauge quantization of the string theory.
The quantization of the oscillators is again the same as
in the maximally supersymmetric IIB pp-wave with respect to  fields,
 
We now compute the spectrum of the string theory by imposing the 
Virasoro constraints
. Before we computing the spectrum, let us note that
p^-=-S X ^+ =
1 40 ^ d[2X ^-
+J_ij X^iX^j ]   .
 From this we can find .
The condition  leads to 
 

with the angular momentum operator

 

and the number operators

 

 

In the above we ignored the zero-point energy 
since it is cancelled by the fermionic
one in the supersymmetric case . 

The other constraint  leads to the level matching
_n=- ^  n(N^+_n +N^-_n )+mw=0.
Finally, we would like to note that 
the spectrum () can also equivalently 
be found from the light-cone Hamiltonian
H&=&1 8(p^+ ^ _0 d[Z ^a
Z  ^a+
Z^a' Z ^a' -2iwR(Z^aZ ^a' - Z ^aZ^a' ) ],&=&1 8(p^+ ^ _0 
d[Z _0^a Z  _0^a+
Z_0^a'  Z _0^a' 
+ 2ip^+(Z_0^aZ  _0^a-Z _0^aZ _0^a)
+4((Rw)^2)].Note that  with  given by thepm  
after imposing the Virasoro constraints.

We now turn to the contribution to the spectrum from world-sheet fermions.
We start with the general action
 
withL  _F=i(^ab _IJ -^ab _3IJ )_a X^ 
 ^I_ D_b ^J ,where  and  are Green-Schwarz fermions, each of
which is a Majorana-Weyl spinor in ten dimensions (sixteen components),
and 
where . The covariant derivative
is given by(Notice that the gamma matrix  is
of the curved spacetime not of the local Minkowski frame. However, in the
discussion below we can neglect this difference as one can see explicitly.) 
D_a =_a +1 4 _a X^ (_ ^ 
-1 45! F_ 
^ (i_2)_ ),where the non-trivial components of the spin connection
are given by .
After we impose
the light-cone gauge  for fermions,
we find the following Lagrangian for the fermions(To derive this
we use the properties of  matrices

. It turns out that only 
the component  
contributes in () and ().) 
L  _F&=&4i(-wR) ^1_+ 
(_+ -i(p^+ +wR)J)^1&&+4i(+wR) ^2_+ 
(_- -i(p^+ -wR)J)^2&&-8i((-(wR)^2)
 ^1^+^1234 ^2,
where  denotes
the spin  of the field .
After normalizing the fermions (both have eight components
as spinors in 8 dimensions) such that
 
and , we obtain
L  _F&=&i(S^1
(_+ -i(p^+ +wR)J)
S^1+
S^2(_- -i(p^+ -wR)J)S^2&&-2(-(wR)^2 S^1^1234 S^2),
where we define the Gamma-matrices 
in eight dimensions by .
Defining the fermionic fields  and  
as follows
S^1(,)
&=&(2iJ(S ^1(,),S^2(,)
&=&(2iJ(S ^2(,),
then the action is equivalent to that of 
the maximally supersymmetric IIB pp-wave. Notice that,
as for the bosonic fields,
we have a twisted boundary condition
S ^1,2 (,+)=e^-2iJwR  S ^1,2 (,).
To diagonalize the matrix  we consider the eigenvalues of
 since the
spin  is given by 
. 
 Then
the eight possible cases can be divided into four with , i.e.  
, and four with , i.e. 
. Here we used the
constraint . In this way we have
found that the fermionic fields  and  have 
the same twisted boundary condition
() as the bosonic ones. This is due to 
supersymmetry and leads to
vanishing zero-point energy.
Since complex conjugation of a spinor change the sign
of its eigenvalue under ,
we can conveniently use the complex fermion fields
 with the charge  and  
with  below.

We can now compute the fermionic part of the light-cone Hamiltonian
H&=&i 32(p^+ _0^  d[
S ^1 S ^1 + S^1 S  ^1
+ S ^2 S ^2 + S^2 S  ^2 ],

&=&i 32(p^+ _0^  d[S  ^1 S  ^1
+S ^1S   ^1+
S  ^2 S  ^2
+S ^2S   ^2
+2ip^+ J (S  ^1S ^1+S ^2 S  ^2)
].We expand the (complex) fermionic field as follows ()
S^1i (,)&=&_n  [
f f^2+(^+_n -f)^2  
 e^-2i^+_n +2i (n+) S^i_n+ &&+i(^-_n -(n-)) 
f^2+(^-_n -f)^2  
e^-2i^-_n -2i (n-) 
(S ^i_n- )],S^2i (,)&=&_n  [f 
f^2+(^-_n -f)^2  
e^-2i^-_n (n-) S ^i_n- &&-i(^+_n -(n+)) 
f^2+(^+_n -f)^2  
e^-2i^+_n +2i (n+) (
S ^i_n+ )], 
where  and  as above.
The quantization of oscillators is given by
 
Finally we can write the Hamiltonian () as follows
 
with the fermionic number operators given by

 

 

 From sp1  and fermham  we see that the 
total spectrum of the string theory on
the compactified maximally 
supersymmetric pp-wave background metmaxpp -fluxmaxpp  is

 

with level matching condition

 

We see that the supersymmetry is manifest in these expressions.


String Spectrum on Universe 

We consider now the T-dual background in type IIA string theory 
and take the limit .
Then we find that the string 
spectrum on the type IIA Universe with 20 supersymmetries 
metn4iia1 -fluxn4iia1 
is given by

 

along with the level matching condition

 



As a check of spcg  we compare now the spectrum of the 
bosonic zero-modes
to the spectrum computed from supergravity.
If we restrict to the zero-modes, then spcg  becomes
E^2-p_y ^2
=2E(N +J +_0),where we set  and
 represents the fermionic 
zero-point energy (see e.g. 
for the detailed analysis of the zero-point energy in the pp-wave).

Let us for example consider the dilaton field 
 () in the background and compare the
above result with that obtained from the low energy supergravity analysis.
The EOM is given by the massless Klein-Gordon equation
^2 y^2 
-^2 t^2 )+_a=1 ^4 (_a  +
^2 _a^2
^2  t^2 
-2^2 t _a )where we denote the Laplacian by 

. 
We assume the form
-iEt+iJ_a _a+ip_y y f(),
and then we obtain the harmonic system
_a=1 ^4 (-_a +(E)^2 _a^2
)f()
=(E^2-p_y ^2- 2E J )f(), 
where . By using standard 
results of harmonic oscillators we find the spectrum
E^2-p_y ^2= 2E (N +J +4),where  is the familiar quantum number
of eight harmonic oscillators. This result exactly matches with the string
theory result (). 




Clearly, the equation for the 
spectrum spcg  is of a rather intricate nature
since it has energy both on the left- and right-hand side.
In order to gain a better understanding of spcg  we consider
the special case where . We then get

 

where we define

) 

If we consider the case where the string only has low-lying
string modes  the spectrum can
be written

 

If we can further neglect the first term, for example by considering
, we see that we get a very unconventional string spectrum.

If we instead consider the case where the string only has
high excitations  the spectrum can
be written as

 

where the last term is small compared to the first term.
If we throw away the last term we can write

 

We see that we regain the flat-space string spectrum if we can neglect
the angular momentum part. 

Finally, going back to the spectrum spcg  with , 
we note that if we take the  limit
we get the spectrum

 

The limit  means the geometry
become strongly curved as we can understand from (). 
As we can see from betabig 
this means the masses of the string states become negligible.
This is why the spectrum betabig  effectively becomes
that of the supergravity modes massless .
This limit is obviously interesting since the radii of
the closed time-like curves would be able 
to become arbitrarily small in this limit
if the supergravity description was valid.
We also note that the spectrum betabig  suggest that one can make
a string bit model similar to the one of 
 
on the maximally supersymmetric pp-wave.



 Universe in type IIA 

As the next case
we examine the string theory in the background 
which is
T-dual to the supersymmetric pp-wave defined
by metppintD3  and fluxppintD3 . This background 
is given by () and () and 
preserves
20 supersymmetries as we have seen above.

The computation of spectrum in the compactified pp-wave can be performed
as in the previous case.
For example, the fermionic part is given by
L  _F&=&i(S^1
(_+ -i(p^+ +wR)J)
S^1+
S^2(_- -i(p^+ -wR)J)S^2&&-(-(wR)^2 S^1(^1256 +^3456 )
S^2),
where the matrix  is given by 
. It is useful to take the following 
linear combinations
for each of the 
two eight components spinors  and 
&&S_1: (+,+,+,+),   S_2: (+,+,-,-),   S_3: (+,-,+,-),
  S_4: (-,+,+,-), &&S _1:(-,-,-,-) ,   S _2: (-,-,+,+) ,   S _3:(-,+,-,+)
,   S _4:(+,-,-,+) , 
where we specified the eigenvalue  of 
.
Then it is easy to see that
(^12 +^34 )S_3,4 =(^12 +^34 )S _3,4 =0,
and thus these four spinors out of eight are massless, while 
the other four are
massive. The value of
 is given by zero for  and  () for
 (). This charge distribution (or equally the
twisted boundary condition) is the same as in the
bosonic fields in the world-sheet theory and this is again due to the
supersymmetry in the compactified solution. 

The string spectrum is given by the previous formula ()
with respect to the  () 
and  (), 
while we should set
 with respect to
 and  ()
excitations. The zero-energy does vanish
due to the remaining supersymmetry. The small radius limit leads to the Universe model and the spectrum is given by
 

along with the level matching condition

 

where  
and  counts the number of oscillators with
spin  and , respectively, and  are the momenta in the four
extra transverse directions.
Obviously, other supersymmetric 
Universe backgrounds of string theory can be treated similarly using
these methods.




D-branes on Universes 

In this section we consider the D-brane spectrum on Universes 
which are T-dual to highly supersymmetric pp-waves. We obtain 
the D-brane spectrum by taking the T-duality transformation of that 
in the pp-wave. Below we investigate this issue from the viewpoint of 
both the boundary condition in the world-sheet theory and the classical
brane solutions in supergravity. We consider the cases of the Universes metn4iia1 -fluxn4iia1  
and G5IIA , fluxG5IIA2 . 



Boundary Conditions in String Theory 

We discuss here
the D-branes in the type IIA  Universe with 
20 supersymmetries,
defined by metn4iia1  and fluxn4iia1  with ,
by applying T-duality to the known D-brane spectrum in the maximally 
supersymmetric type IIB pp-wave. We consider here
the D-branes on the pp-wave that have Neumann
boundary conditions in the  and  directions.
Then the 
half-BPS D-brane in the pp-wave background is given by 
the D-branes () which have the boundary
condition ,  and  respectively
(Here the symbol  means Neumann boundary 
conditions for 

 following the
convention.)  
 
(see also). The spectrum also 
includes the 1/4 BPS D1-brane . Below 
we study the T-dual counterparts of these branes.


To investigate the D-brane spectrum we consider in the following 
the boundary conditions for D-branes
(see also for similar analysis 
in the exactly solvable model of magnetic universe).  
For simplicity we discuss only the bosonic part of the boundary conditions.
Under the T-duality in the  direction 
the world-sheet fields are transformed as follows.
(For a general formula see e.g. 
It is given by
y &=&-B_y x^ -g_yy (y+G_y x^),  y &=&-B_y   x^ 
+g_yy (  y+G_y   x^).
) 
_D y&=&_N y +(_1^2_D_1+_2^2_D_2
+_3^2_D_3-_4^2_D_4),_N y&=&_D y +(_1^2_N_1+_2^2_N_2
+_3^2_N_3-_4^2_N_4),
where we defined  and 
. 
Here and in the rest of this section we call
the T-duality direction  in the pp-wave background
and  in the T-dual Universe background.

In order to take the T-duality we assume the D-brane is placed away
from the origin at fixed . 
Thus, while the D-brane is at a fixed position in the  coordinates
(and therefore in the  and  coordinates),
the position of the D-brane
is rotating as  and 

in the original coordinates of the pp-wave metmaxpp .
These shifted D-brane configurations can be obtained by a symmetry
transformation described in and they
have the same amount of supersymmetry as before. 



D0-branes from D1-branes 

Before the T-duality
a D1-brane on the pp-wave has the following boundary conditions
&&_D _i  =0,  _D _i  =0,   (i=1,2,3,4) 
 

&&_N x^+ =0, 

&&_N x^-+(_1^2_N _1+_2^2_N _2
+_3^2 _N  _3
-_4^2 _N _4)=0,where bcd13  comes from the consideration of symmetries
acting on boundary conditions. 
After rewriting the above boundary conditions using (), we get 
&&_N t+(_1^2_N _1+_2^2_N _2
+_3^2 _N  _3
-_4^2 _N _4)=0, 

&&_D y =0, with ().  Finally let us compare this result with
the general boundary conditions
(Here the index  in the mixed Neumann condition
 should be taken along the world-volume direction.) 
&&G_ _N X^+(B_ +F_ )
 _D X^_ =0  
 (mixed Neumann ) 
 &&or   
 _D f(X^)_ =0     
(Dirichlet ) .
In conclusion the boundary conditions bcd1tt  and bcd1t 
shows that the D-brane obtained by T-duality is a D0-brane in the background. Indeed its world-volume  
is equivalent to the time-like geodesic line.


D2 and D4-branes from D3-branes 

Let us consider a D3-brane whose world-volume is along 

in the pp-wave background. The computations are almost the same as above.
We obtain bcd1t  again by T-duality (the other conditions are the same
 as before T-duality). Thus we get a D2-brane extended in the  
which means we have a "small" 
Universe in the world-volume directions. 
 
A more interesting case is the D3-brane whose world-volume is given by
. In this case we start with the following 
boundary conditions
in the pp-wave
&&_N _1,2  =0,  _D _3,4  =0, 
 

&&_D (_1-x^+)=_D (_2-x^+)=0,  
_D _3,4 =0, 

&&_N x^+ =0, 

&&_N x^-+(_3^2 _N  _3
-_4^2 _N _4)=0.After we take T-duality, the result is given by () and
&&_D (_1-_2)=0,

&&(_1^2 _N _1+_2^2 _N _2)+
_D y =0,

&&_N y +_D t+
(_1^2 _D _1+_2^2 _D _2)-1  
_D _1=0.
Comparing with () and (), 
we find that the
resulting system represents a D4-brane whose world-volume coordinate 
is given by
 and  with the gauge flux
F_ty  =-1,  F_y  =-1  .D6-branes from D5-branes 

We can assume that the world-volume of D5-brane is in the direction of
. Then we find almost 
the same boundary conditions as for the D4-brane from the D3-brane,  
and the result is given by a D6-brane
extending in the direction 
 and 
with the flux ().

D6 and D8-branes from D7-branes 

If we consider the D7-brane extending
in the direction , then we get
D6-brane (with no gauge flux) in the model as in the same way as in
the D1-brane in pp-wave.

For the D7-brane whose world-volume is given by
, we obtain
a D8-brane in the direction 
 and 
with the gauge flux () in the same way as when we got a
D4-brane from a D3-brane.

Summary of D-branes in the model 

In this way we get D0,D2,D4,D6 and D8-branes in the background.
In particular we have obtained the D-branes
with both electric and magnetic fluxes for D4,D6 and D8-branes. 
Apart from the D0-branes, 
the above list of D-branes have world-volumes 
which include closed time-like curves so that we have 
"small" Universes along their world-volumes.
It would be interesting to study the gauge theories on these
world-volumes.

Classical Brane Solutions in Supergravity 

We now consider D-branes on Universes from the 
viewpoint of the supergravity solutions. The example we discuss
here is that of a D4-brane in the  model 
given by G5IIA , fluxG5IIA2  with 20 
supersymmetries. We find the supergravity solution for a smeared
D4-brane by performing 
T-duality transformations of a D5-brane solution in the pp-wave
metppintD3 , fluxppD1D5 . The D5-brane solution was 
found in (see also 
and 
for related systems). Afterwards we consider the localized D4-brane.

The D5-brane solution on the pp-wave is
&&ds^2=h^-12 (-2dx^+ dx^- -^2_i=1 ^4(x ^i)^2
(dx^+ )^2+_i=1 ^4(dx ^i)^2 )
+h^12 _j=5 ^8(dx^j)^2 ,&&h=1+Ng_s' r^2 ,   e^2 =g^-1 ,  
 F_+12 =F_+34 =2,&&   F_ijk =-_ijkl _l h, (5i,j,k,l 8),
where  is the number of D5-branes and also 
we defined  .
If we simply take the T-duality as before 
we obtain the smeared D4-brane
solution in the model. To localize this solution 
we have to replace the function
 with 
f=1+Ng_s(')^32 r^3  
r_i=5 ^9(x^i)^2 ,

as follows 
&&ds^2=f^-12 (-(dt+_i=1 ^4 J_ij x^i dx^j)^2
+_i=1 ^4(dx^i)^2 )+f^12 _i=5 ^9(dx^i)^2,&&e^2 =f^-12 , 
   F_12 =F_34 =-2,    H_129 =H_349 =-2,  && F_0129 =F_0349 =2,    
F_ijkl =-_ijklm _m f, (5i,j,k,l,m 9),
where  and .
We have checked all components of the EOMs and found that
this is indeed a supergravity solution.(To be exact we cannot
express the solution by using the field strengths 
in a gauge invariant way. This is because the action include the term 
 with  and 
the gauge transformations of the potentials are given by 
. 
Thus we should specify the value of gauge field  and in this paper
we have set .)  

We can also consider the M-theory lift of this solution. 
As discussed before we know that the lift of the Universe itself leads
to the pp-wave in M-theory which preserves 24 supersymmetries 
() and ().
After changing the coordinates according to () 
we obtain the (localized) M5-brane solution in the pp-wave (the smeared
solution can be found in)
&&ds^2=f^-13 (-2dx^+dx^- -^2_i=1 ^4(x ^i)^2(dx^+)^2
+_i=1 ^4(dx ^i)^2)+f^23 _i=5 ^9 (dx^i)^2,&& F_+129 =F_+349 =2,    F_ijkl =-_ijklm _m f
  (5i,j,k,l9).
It would be interesting to construct other
Dp-brane solutions in this Universe or in other backgrounds (see 
 for
classical D-brane solutions in the maximally supersymmetric pp-wave).



Discussion and Conclusions 



In this paper we have found several new supersymmetric 
Universe backgrounds of string and M-theory. 
We discovered that not only T-duality, but also the
type-IIA/M-theory S-duality can give supersymmetric
Universes from pp-waves.
We explained that the S-duality could be considered
equivalent to the T-duality when  by
considering M-theory on a three-torus. 
We found that there exist 
three inequivalent Universes with 20
supersymmetries, one of which demonstrated the fact that the
S-duality transformation is not always equivalent to the
T-duality. 

We have found an intriguing M-theory  Universe with 
18 supersymmetries. This background does not seem to be related
to pp-waves by dualities. It would be interesting to consider if
one can compactify the background to a type IIA string theory 
solution, perhaps this can reveal connections to other 
supersymmetric backgrounds. 
In connection with the  background with 18 supersymmetries
we found that it is a member of 
a family of M-theory Universes with at least 16 supersymmetries
of which the  and the  M-theory Universe
with 20 supersymmetries also are members.

We found two new supersymmetric backgrounds 
which are mixtures of Universes and pp-waves. 
Perhaps one can use these backgrounds to construct a holographic
dual to the string theory since we can consider a small
deformation away from the pp-wave and try to deform the
gauge theory dual of the pp-wave so that
it is dual to the deformed background.

We have also considered the string theory on two of the
type IIA Universes with 20 supersymmetries.
We have shown that the string theory on these backgrounds
are solvable and found the string spectrum. 
This was done using the fact that one can light-cone
quantize the T-dual pp-wave when compactified in the
T-duality direction.
We note that part of the spectrum looks very much like
that found in 
 where a space-like
compactification of the maximally symmetric type IIB
pp-wave was considered. Perhaps one can find a similar Penrose
limit of  as in giving
directly the maximally supersymmetric type IIB pp-wave
metmaxpp -fluxmaxpp  in the coordinate
system of aftercoII . This would enable one to find
a dual gauge theory description of the Universe 
background.

We have also considered the spectrum of 
D-branes on the two backgrounds in which 
we quantized the string theory. 
Using again the T-dual pp-wave backgrounds we found the
spectrum of D-branes on one of the backgrounds,
and found a supergravity solution for a D4-brane 
on the other Universe background.




In this paper we have not directly
addressed the perhaps most important physical question for
string theory on a background of the Universe type,
namely whether string theory is consistent on these backgrounds
or not. Can string theory work when we have closed time-like curves?

We have seen several indications in this paper which suggest
that the supersymmetric Universes
are consistent string theory backgrounds. The high amount of 
supersymmetry for some of these backgrounds alone suggests that
the backgrounds should be well-behaved. 
In particular they should not have closed string tachyons 
and should therefore be stable as string theory backgrounds.
Moreover, the fact that string theory on some of the Universe
backgrounds is highly solvable, i.e. that
we can 1st-quantize the string theory and obtain
the string spectrum without problems, also suggests that the
string theory is well-defined.
Finally, the fascinating fact that there are 
type IIA Universes which are S-dual to M-theory pp-waves
means physically that string theory on those type IIA backgrounds is well-behaved at strong coupling.

If  is on a circle of radius  before the T-duality
then it is on a circle of radius  after the T-duality.
For RR field strengths the T-duality transformations from 
IIA to IIB are

 

while for IIB to IIA they are

Note that we have the convention that

M/IIA S-duality conventions 

Consider an M-theory background with the coordinate
 being an explicit space-like isometry with .
We consider the S-duality between type IIA string theory
and M-theory with  being the eleventh direction.
The relation between the eleven- and ten-dimensional metrics is

 

where  is the one-form RR gauge
potential in type IIA string theory. The dilaton is constant
since we assumed . The relations between the
four-form field strength in M-theory and the RR four-form and NS-NS
three-form field strength in type IIA are

 





Computations of supersymmetry 

We compute the supersymmetry of various solutions found in
Section .

Supersymmetry of compactified pp-waves 

We consider here the supersymmetry of
pp-waves of type IIB which have a compact direction.
We follow the discussion of
.
In general the supersymmetry variation of the dilatino
 and the gravitino  can be written
(In this section we use the notation and conventions of
 so the definition of  here is different
from the rest of the paper. For example


 and so forth.
Here , are two
Majorana spinors with same chirality both with 16 components.
We also use that ,
 and
.) 

 

where  is the torsion in type IIB.  and  involves
both NS-NS and RR field strengths. We use the conventions
of for the supersymmetry variations susyvar 
in type IIB.
We then compactify the solutions along the Killing vector with unit norm

 

where .
This leads to the extra condition on Killing spinors

 

where we have put  for simplicity.
To further simplify the analysis we define

 

We see that the eigenvalues of  are .
Note that  has eigenvalue  for kinematical
supersymmetries, i.e. when , and eigenvalue
 for dynamical supersymmetries, i.e. when .
Note also that any eigenvalue of  has degeneracy two.

We consider now the maximally supersymmetric pp-wave of type IIB
metmaxpp -fluxmaxpp with 32 supersymmetries.
We have

 

When the direction killvec  is compact, we see that we have
8 kinematical and 12 dynamical supersymmetries, giving altogether
20 supersymmetries.

For the mixed pp-wave solution with NS-NS and RR three-form flux
metppintD3 , fluxppmix  we
compute

 

We see that the dilatino variation 
gives 24 supersymmetries in the uncompactified case, i.e. 16 kinematical
and 8 dynamical.
When the direction killvec  is compact we see that
we need  for a generic value of , thus giving
16 supersymmetries, i.e. 8 kinematical and 8 dynamical.
If  then we get instead 12 kinematical and 8 dynamical
supersymmetries, giving altogether 20 supersymmetries.

For the mixed pp-wave solution with RR three and five-form flux
metpp28 -fluxpp28 
 we have

 

We see that the dilatino variation 
gives 28 supersymmetries in the uncompactified case, i.e. 16 kinematical
and 12 dynamical.
When the direction killvec  is compact we see that
we have 0 kinematical and 12 dynamical supersymmetries, giving altogether
12 supersymmetries. It is also easy to see that the special case
 there are 20 supersymmetries
(12 dynamical ones + 8 kinematical ones).






Supersymmetry of M-theory backgrounds 

Here we show the analysis of spinors of several backgrounds
in M-theory explicitly.

(1) M-theory 
background  metn4M1  and fluxn4M1  (20 susy)



After we solve the Killing spinor 
equations (), we obtain the following 
ten
 constant spinors 
^(1) =^-++ ,
   ^(2) =^-++- ,   ^(3) =^+-+-    
^(4) =^-+- ,     ^(5) =^-- ,
where we specify by using the  values of 
 (note that
there is the degeneracy of factor two) as well as the other ten spinors
which depend on the coordinates  linearly 
^(6) &=&(1+2J_ij ^0i x^j)^++-+ ,^(7) &=&(1-2^04 x^3+2^03 x^4
-2^06 x^5+2^05 x^6)^+-++ ,^(8) &=&(1-2^02 x^1+2^01 x^2
-2^06 x^5+2^05 x^6)^-+++ ,^(9) &=&(1-2^04 x^3+2^03 x^4
+2^08 x^7-2^07 x^8)^+- ,^(10) &=&(1-2^02 x^1+2^01 x^2
+2^08 x^7+2^07 x^8)^-+- .Thus we can conclude that there are 20 supersymmetries in this background.




(2) M-theory 
background  metn5 ,fluxn5  and almost  (18 or 16 susy)

In this case again we have only to solve (). We find
the constant 10 Killing spinors 
^(1) =^+-++ ,  ^(2) =^-+++ ,   
^(3) =^-++ ,  ^(4) =^-+- ,  
^(5) =^-+ ,
and the non-constant 6 Killing spinors
^(6) &=&(1+2J_ij ^0i x^j)^++- ,^(7) &=&(1-2k^04 x^3+2k^03 x^4
-2k^06 x^5+2k^05 x^6)^+-+ ,^(8) &=&(1-2k^04 x^3+2k^03 x^4
-2k^08 x^7+2k^07 x^8)^+-+- ,where the values of  is given by
 as defined in ().
Thus we can conclude that there are 16 supersymmetries in this model.

If we assume , we get the extra Killing spinor
^(9) &=&(1-2^04 x^3+2^03 x^4
+2^0 x^9-2^09 x^ )^+- .
Therefore in this special case  we get 18 supersymmetries.

	


(3) M-theory background  metn4M2 -fluxn4M2  (12 susy) 

Since we have already shown that the small radius limit (type IIA model)
has 12 supersymmetries (see ()) we have only to check that
the background in M-theory does not allow more than 12 supersymmetries.
To see this let us consider the time component 
of Killing spinor equation (). This is given by
&&(_0 + 2 (^12 
+^34 +^56 -^78 ))
= 12 (^01234 +^05678 )
 &&
-16 (^0129 +^0349 
+^0569 -^0789 )+13(^129 
+^349 +^569 -^789 ). 









For generic  (), we have the conditions

. Thus we
find 12 supersymmetries in this background.


(4) M-theory background  metn2mix -fluxn2mix  (16 susy)

The Killing spinor can be examined as in the previous case ().
The result is given by the constraint ,
and thus we have 16 supersymmetries generically.
