  ABSTRACT   


We study the heterotic string compactified on 
near the line , where the effective action becomes
singular due to an  gauge symmetry enhancement.  
By 'integrating in' the light
 vector multiplets we derive a quantum corrected effective
action which is manifestly  invariant and non-singular.
This effective action is  
found to be consistent with a residual 
quantum symmetry  on the line .
In an appropriate decompactification limit, we recover the known  
invariant action in five dimensions.

Introduction 





The low energy effective action of string theories is of
particular importance, since it captures the interactions of the
light string excitations. Its derivation has a long history and
has been continuously refined. The main idea is to integrate out
the heavy string modes and to derive an effective action of only the
light modes below the mass scale of the heavy excitations.

Generically, this low energy effective action features a set of
moduli scalar fields whose vacuum expectation values are not
determined since they correspond to flat directions of the
effective potential. In compactifications of the ten-dimensional
string theories on compact Ricci-flat manifolds, , some of the
moduli have a geometrical meaning in that they correspond to
deformations of the metric on  that preserve the
Ricci-flatness. These deformations can be viewed as coordinates of
the moduli space, , of . Unfortunately, all couplings in
the low energy effective theory depend on these undetermined
vacuum expectation values and therefore phenomenological
predictions are difficult to extract. One expects that
non-perturbative effects generate a potential for the moduli
fields and thus dynamically lift this vacuum degeneracy.


It has become clear for some time that interesting physics is
'hidden' at special points in the moduli space where some
couplings in the effective action become  singular. From a
mathematical point of view, these singularities often arise at
points  (or subspaces) of   the moduli space where the
compactification manifold  develops a singularity.
 From a physical point of view,
the singularities generically are due to heavy
 fields that become massless at the locus of the singularity.
Integrating these fields out of the effective theory is thus not
legitimate in this region of the moduli space, and this
inconsistency manifests itself as a singularity in some of the
effective couplings.


In general, a consistent, i.e. non-singular, effective action
cannot be derived over the entire moduli space, since, as
described above, some of the fields are only light at particular
points (or subspaces) of  the moduli space. Their mass, , is a
nontrivial function of the moduli, and thus  varies over the
moduli space. However, locally near a given singularity  where
some of the fields are light and  approaches zero, one can
choose to not integrate out these light fields and derive a
non-singular effective action in the vicinity of  , i.e.
near the region of the former singularity. Differently put - and
that is the way we will proceed in this paper - one can start
from the singular action and locally 'integrate the light modes
back in'.(The term 'integrating in' was coined in
 in a slightly different context.) 


The purpose of this paper is to perform this 'integrating in'
procedure in some detail in a model where the
 singular
effective action is known exactly. More specifically, we consider
the heterotic string compactified on , which leads
to an effective theory with  supersymmetry in four space-time
dimensions (). This class of string backgrounds is believed
to be dual to type IIA string theory compactified on  fibered
Calabi-Yau threefolds 
. As a consequence,
some of the couplings of the low energy effective theory are known
exactly.

The low energy  supergravity theory  contains, apart from the
gravitational multiplet, a set of  vector multiplets and
 hypermultiplets. Both multiplets contain scalar fields which
can be viewed as the coordinates of the moduli space . As a
consequence of  supersymmetry, this moduli space factorizes:
, where  is spanned by the scalars
in the vector multiplets, and  is spanned by the scalars in
the hypermultiplets. Due to this factorization, one can discuss
each component separately, and in this paper we will only focus on
.  is constrained to be a special Kahler manifold
, that is,  is endowed with a Kahler metric
which  can be expressed in terms of a holomorphic prepotential
 (see Appendix A).


For a certain class of compactifications,  is known exactly,
and here we focus on a very specific model known as the
-model. It corresponds to a compactification of the heterotic
string on a  manifold with instanton numbers
. This model   is non-perturbatively dual to the IIA
string compactified on the Calabi-Yau threefold
, which is an elliptic fibration over the
second Hirzebruch surface  
. 
The generic low energy
effective theory contains  vector multiplets (whose complex
scalar fields we denote by
  )  and  neutral hypermultiplets. The hypermultiplets
 play no role
in the following and will be consistently ignored. The gauge group
at a generic point in the moduli space is , where the
additional gauge boson is the  graviphoton. At the subspace
,  is enlarged to , at  it
is further enhanced to , and at 
  one finally has .
In other words, at these special points additional gauge bosons
(or rather  vector multiplets) become massless and enhance
the everywhere existing Abelian to a non-Abelian gauge symmetry.
From  the point of view of the heterotic string, this is the usual
perturbative gauge symmetry enhancement due to additional massless
Kaluza-Klein and winding modes for particular values of
the moduli of the two-torus. 
This symmetry enhancement does not survive
non-perturbative quantum corrections, and we will
therefore restrict our considerations to the perturbative
heterotic string only.(From the point of view of the type
IIA string, the  gauge symmetry enhancement is, at the
classical level, due to a shrunken two-cycle of the Calabi Yau
three-fold,
  with the wrapped D2 brane
giving rise to the  bosons. Unlike its M-theory analogue
,
this geometrical singularity (and hence the symmetry enhancement)
does not survive quantum corrections. These quantum corrections
can be calculated in the dual IIB picture using mirror symmetry. 
The mirror threefold develops a conifold singularity and one 
gets massless hypermultiplets with magnetic or dyonic charge,
which come from D3 branes wrapping the vanishing three-cycle.) 


The one-loop prepotential  is singular at , which
signals the existence of the additional light states. As we show
in this paper, it is possible to derive an effective action valid
near  which is non-singular and which contains the 
gauge bosons of the .  Following the approach of,
we   will not do this via a microscopic string theory calculation,
but rather
  by using symmetry arguments to
reconstruct the non-singular theory from the well-known
 singular effective action, in which the  bosons are integrated out.




Our motivation for this work is to study compactifications of 
string theory and  
M-theory in situations where the effective action becomes
singular due to the presence of additional light modes. Such 
extra states might be either of perturbative or non-perturbative
origin. In this paper, we consider the heterotic perturbative mechanism
of  enhancement, as explained above. The natural next 
step will be to consider conifold singularities in compactifications
of type II string theory on Calabi-Yau threefolds. In this case
the additional states are non-perturbative and descend from 
D-branes wrapped on a vanishing cycle. Since heterotic string compactifications 
on  are dual to type II compactifications 
on Calabi-Yau threefolds,
we expect that the results of this
paper will be useful for the study of conifolds.





There are further, even more interesting cases one might wish to
consider. One line of developement will be the study of extremal
transitions, where one has, in contrast to conifold transitions,
an unbroken non-abelian gauge symmetry at the transition point
. Another interesting extension is to add
background flux, which can resolve the singularity
 and create a hierarchically small scale
. Besides Calabi-Yau compactifications one
should also try to study   supersymmetric
 -compactifications of M-theory along similar lines.
Here the understanding of singular manifolds is mandatory,
  as smooth -compactification
do not lead to non-abelian gauge groups or chiral fermions
. We hope to return to these issues in later
publications.





This paper is organized as follows. In section , we
briefly recall the results for the perturbative prepotential in
the -model. In section , we then derive the tree
level action for the effective theory near  with the 
gauge bosons (and their superpartners) included. We explicitly
compute the potential and the masses of the  
supermultiplets. In section  we determine the one-loop
corrections to this effective action near . Based on general
arguments, we first show (section ) that the minimum
of the quantum corrected potential does not change and the masses
only receive multiplicative corrections which are entirely due to
corrections of the Kahler potential. In analogy with 
supergravity, it is possible to define a  'holomorphic mass' which
remains uncorrected. In section , we determine the
loop-corrected prepotential by using the known result of the
-model. We 'undo' the integrating out procedure of the
 gauge bosons by subtracting their threshold corrections to
the  gauge couplings. This way we derive a  non-singular
quantum corrected prepotential for the  gauge theory. In
section  we check that this prepotential transforms
appropriately under the expected residual quantum duality symmetry
 and that it does have the proper singularities at
points in the moduli space where further gauge enhancement occurs.
This is an independent check on our procedure. Finally, in
section , we decompactify the theory to five
space-time dimensions and establish the consistency with the
results of. 

Some technical details are relegated to three appendices. In
appendix , we supply the necessary facts of 
supergravity. In appendix , we assemble some useful
formulae about the polylog series, while in appendix we review properties of modular forms.






Preliminaries: Review of the -model 
Let us first recall a few facts about the -model
. At the string tree level it
is characterized by the prepotential(For a review of
 supergravity see appendix A.)  Fst  ^(0)  = -
STU = - S(T_+^2 -T_-^2) , where 
.








The quantum correction  of the vector multiplet couplings can be
parameterized by corrections to this prepotential. They only
appear at 1-loop (generating a correction  ) and
non-perturbatively (generating a contribution ).
Therefore, the quantum corrected   prepotential obeys the
expansion .  is
known from a heterotic computation, while
 is known from the duality to IIA on the Calabi-Yau
threefold
 .
As we restrict ourselves to the  perturbative heterotic string,
only the one-loop correction  is of interest. For the
rest of this paper we neglect the non-perturbative correction
 and, by abuse of notation, simply write
 

We already displayed  in (). For
,  is  given by 
where the third polylog  is defined in appendix B, and the
coefficients
  
can be found in. As was pointed out in
,  is only determined up to a
quadratic polynomial in the variables  with purely
imaginary coefficients. Adding any such polynomial simply amounts
to a shift in  theta angles; we will come back to this ambiguity
in section .

 is largely determined by its quantum symmetries. The
-model has the perturbative quantum symmetry
, which
 includes the exchange
 as well as the duality  group
. Here,  acts on   as
TaT-ibicT+d  ,UU , ad-bc =1,
a,b,c,d, Z  , whereas the action of
   is obtained by  exchanging  with . As a
consequence of this symmetry, the third derivative 
 is a modular form of weight , while
 is a modular form of weight 
under . They are given by
 _T^3^(1)  &
=& +12 E_4(iT) E_4(iU) E_6(iU) ^-24 (iU)
        j(iT)-j(iU) ,

_U^3^(1)  &
=& -12 E_4(iU) E_4(iT) E_6(iT) ^-24 (iT)
        j(iT)-j(iU) ,
 where  the modular forms , ,
,  are defined in Appendix C.

As we discuss more explicitly in sections  and
,
  
 is singular at  due to gauge symmetry enhancement:
T=U:U(1)U(1) && U(1)SU(2) ,

T=U=1:U(1)U(1) && SU(2)SU(2) ,

T=U=:U(1)U(1) && SU(3) .At
these points additional massless vector multiplets appear which
should not have   been integrated out of the effective action and
which are the origin of the singular couplings ().










The tree level effective action  
  Our goal in this paper is
to derive a non-singular effective action that gives an accurate
description of the theory near the surface , where the
 gauge symmetry enhancement occurs. In this section, we
restrict ourselves to the tree level approximation of this
effective theory. This sets our notation and prepares the
discussion of the one-loop corrections.













Let us begin with our notation regarding the spectrum. Near the
surface , the set of light fields in the low energy effective
 action
has to be enlarged to also include  the  bosons (along
with  their superpartners). The effective action is thus an 
supergravity theory with  vector multiplets in which
 is realized as a Yang-Mills-type gauge symmetry.

Three of these five vector multiplets have to transform in the
adjoint representation of , and we  use , to
denote the complex scalar fields of this triplet.

We choose to identify  and  with the scalar
superpartners of the  bosons:
 
The scalar field  then has to be identified with 
, whose vacuum expectation value triggers the symmetry
breaking     via a supersymmetric
Higgs effect.

In addition to the triplet , there are two  singlet
vector multiplets, and  at tree level the scalars of these singlet
multiplets can be chosen to coincide with the moduli  and
.(
In general, the two singlets have to be invariant under the Weyl
twist , which is the only remnant of the
 symmetry after  and  have been integrated
out. According to the identification , the Weyl twist
is equivalent the exchange symmetry .
At string tree level, both  and  are -invariant
and can therefore be identified with the two  singlets, as
we did above.) 











The   scalar fields  are  'special' coordinates of a
symplectic section  , which in our
conventions (see Appendix A for details) means that
 

In the following, we  use the subscript 'in' to label all actions,
prepotentials, etc., where the two  bosons have been
'integrated in'. More explicitly,  denotes the full
perturbative effective action near   with the 
bosons included, while  refers to the
underlying prepotential. The corresponding tree level quantities

are denoted by  and 
, respectively.





The prepotential  is a holomorphic
function of the variables  . Its defining property is
that the corresponding action, ,
should reproduce the action  encoded in the
prepotential  of eq. (),
when  (and their superpartners) are integrated out.

At tree level, no threshold effects can occur, and integrating out
these two multiplets simply means to set them equal to zero in the
action  or, equivalently, in the
prepotential .(The
consistency of this truncation is guaranteed because 
form a doublet of an obvious .)  As the
'in-theory' is to be  invariant, the triplet  can only
appear via its  invariant combination , and
integrating out  at tree level is thus tantamount  to
making the replacement
 
everywhere in .

Conversely,
   can simply be
obtained from  by  the
inverse substitution
 
We therefore arrive at
 
as the tree level prepotential with the two  bosons
included.

As a consequence of  supersymmetry,

 is
completely determined by ()  and can in principle be
worked out in all detail using the relations  reviewed in Appendix
A. For the rest of this section, let us content ourselves with a
short discussion of some of the quantities that play a role in
the integrating out process.


Consider first   the Ka hler potential, , of the scalar
manifold, . Using (),  one obtains for

 KSU2  K= -(S+S) -Y
,Y(T_+ +T_+)^2 - (C^a+C^a) (C^a+C^a)
. This is the
  Ka hler potential of  the symmetric space 
 with
isometry group 
. The form  () corresponds  to a parametrization
in which only the subgroup  is  a manifest
symmtry of the Ka hler potential.(The  factor
acts as , 
.) 
The Yang-Mills-type gauge group of the theory is to be identified
with the  subgroup of the  factor. On the
homogeneous coordinates, , this  acts as
 
where we have identified the structure constants
. On the scalar manifold,
, the corresponding   isometries are
generated by Killing vectors :
 
From the relation (),
  one   reads off(Using eqs. () and (),
one arrives at  the same result.) 
 
The Killing vectors enter the covariant derivatives of the scalar
fields
 (see ()),




as well as the scalar potential,
 
Obviously,     is   positive semi-definite, and zero if and
only if
 
In view of (), this means that the vacua of the theory
correspond to field configurations with
 
Thus, any vacuum can be brought to the form 
 by means of an  transformation. As
the gaugino variations are proportional to the quantity
 ,
all these vacua also preserve the  supersymmetry (and also
exhaust all  supersymmetric Minkowski vacua).

Remembering , we have therefore, at tree level,
 simply rediscovered
that, modulo  transformations,  indeed
parametrize the flat directions  of the scalar potential
 and that all of the corresponding vacua are  supersymmetric.

Let us close this section with a short discussion of the
tree-level masses of the  bosons and their scalar
superpartners in these vacua. The mass of any scalar field arises
from non-vanishing second derivatives of the scalar potential.
Combining (), () and (), the
tree-level scalar potential is
 

At , the only
non-vanishing  second derivatives of this potential   are
 
and similarly for the derivatives with respect to  and
.

In order to diagonalize these mass matrices, one decomposes 
and   into the real fields parallel and perpendicular to
 :
 
One then finds
 
with all other derivatives vanishing. Taking into account
 
the kinetic terms of  and  simplify to
 
and we see that only  obtain a mass, but  not 
or any other scalar field. The mass of the corresponding
canonically normalized scalar fields is given by
 

This mass formula agrees with the one obtained from string theory,
which reads:
M^2 = 4  T-U^2  (T+ T )
(U+U )  = 
16 T_-^2 Y  .
To see the agreement, one has to reinstall the gravitational coupling
, which we have set to unity throughout, to
convert string units into gravitational
units using  and to 
express the heterotic string coupling   
through the vev of the dilaton, 
. 

In analogy with  theories, we define a holomorphic mass, ,
through the relation ,
 which for the case at hand implies(
The mass parameters of an  superpotential are necessarily
holomorphic and a similar feature holds for masses generated via a
supersymmetric Higgs effect. Such holomorphic mass
parameters are of importance due to their non-renormalization
properties. In  theories one can analogously define a
holomorphic mass, and, as we will see in section ,
this mass is not renormalized.)  
 

As the
  vacua with  preserve the full
 supersymmetry, one should observe     a supersymmetric Higgs
effect in which the vector fields  (i.e., the
 bosons) absorb the massless components  and
acquire the same mass as their scalar superpartners 
(). And indeed, the mass term for the vector
fields arises from the square of the covariant derivative D_C^a =
_C^a - k^a _b A_^b  which leads to the mass
matrix MSU2first  M^2_ab  = 2 g^2 g_cd  k^c_a
k^d _b  where 

 ensures the correct canonical
normalization. For  
, one has 
 
so that one  indeed   obtains the same mass matrices as above:
 

As  depends holomorphically on the moduli, it
should not receive  loop corrections. We will verify this in
Section .









The one-loop corrections  In this section we go beyond the tree
level approximation and determine the one-loop corrections to the
effective action  described in the previous
section. Our result will be an action  that describes
the full low energy dynamics of the perturbative heterotic string
near . This action again involves the coupling of five vector
multiplets to  supergravity and exhibits an  gauge
symmetry. Several properties of this action follow already from
its gauge invariance and can  be inferred without a detailed
knowledge of all the couplings. We list these general properties
in section  before we construct the complete theory
with all the detailed couplings in section .

Some general properties of  Just as in the tree level case, three of the five vector fields
transform in the adjoint representation of , while the
remaining two have to be  inert. The scalars of the triplet
are again denoted by  , with 
corresponding to the  bosons and . In the
tree level approximation, we could choose  and  as the
scalar fields of the two singlet multiplets, because both are
classically invariant under the Weyl twist 
, which is the only remnant of the 
gauge symmetry once the  are  integrated out.  At one
loop, this is still true for , however,
  now  becomes a multivalued
function on the moduli space and transforms non-trivially under
the perturbative duality group .
More precisely, using eq. (4.27) in ref., one finds

 

Thus,  can no longer serve as one of the  singlets.
Fortunately, it is easy to construct a -invariant linear
combination  out of :(The most general
-invariant linear combination would be 
with  arbitrary.  is singled out   by the property
, a property
    that simplifies some of the equations in Section .
Note that neither  nor  is the 'invariant
dilaton'  described in. The invariant dilaton

  is a highly non-linear
  function of the moduli that is invariant under the full duality group
. , by contrast,  is only invariant
under the Weyl twist . It is the part of  that is
linear    in the moduli. As such,    is a proper
'special coordinate', i.e., a scalar field of an  vector
multiplet, a property not shared by the full invariant dilaton
.) 
 
The two singlet scalars are therefore chosen to be
 .


We assume that  are special coordinates of a
symplectic section

 for which a holomorphic prepotential
- denoted by  -
exists.(This assumption is supported by the tree level
approximation discussed in the previous section and the
self-consistency of our one-loop result (Sections  and
). Using   the tree level approximation, however, one
can also show
  that the rank two gauge groups
at  and  (which are beyond the scope of the
present paper) cannot  be manifestly realized in a
symplectic basis with a prepotential.)  The relation to the
notation of  Appendix A is  given by
 

Thus far, the only difference to the tree level case is that  the
singlet  is to be identified with  instead of .
It is therefore not surprising that many of the general
conclusions we drew in Section   go through   for   the
one-loop corrected theory as well. In particular, the 
transformation properties of the  remain formally the same,
 
which, together with  the analogue of eqs. (),
implies that the Killing vectors do not get
renormalized:
 

Similarly, one can repeat large parts of the analysis of the
scalar potential,
 

Because of the manifestly positive semidefinite form, the  vacua
are again given by  
,
which, in the light of (), again implies that any
Minkowski vacuum can be brought to the form 
 by means of an  rotation. These
vacua are also the supersymmetric ones, and we see that the
one-loop corrections might change the shape of the scalar
poptential, but not its ground states.

So far, everything we 'derived' in this section was completely
independent
 of the prepotential  and solely based on the assumed
 gauge invariance and the underlying  supersymmetry.
The  symmetry, however, also restricts the possible form of
the prepotential, which in turn allows us to make further
statements about the theory without the  detailed  knowledge of
the prepotential.




More precisely, the  gauge symmetry of the theory requires
that  be  invariant.
Consequently, the triplet  can only appear via the 
invariant combination  (or  powers thereof). Hence, the
prepotential  has to be of the general form
 
where  denotes a set of as yet undetermined
functions of the singlets  and . Determining these
functions  will be the content of Sections ,
 and , but a number of statements already
follow from the general form (). As an example, let
us again  consider the masses of the scalar fields.

First note that in a vacuum with
 , the metric components
 and  simplify to
 
where 
 has been used. A closer
inspection of () then reveals that the only
non-vanishing second derivatives of  are
 
and analogously for the derivatives with respect to ,
 (remembering 
). These mass matrices are again diagonalized
by a decomposition as in (). In terms of the corresponding
fields  and , the only non-vanishing derivatives are then
 
Taking into account the corresponding kinetic terms,
 
 one obtains for
the masses of
 the corresponding canonically normalized scalar fields
 
This has the same form as in the tree level approximation, but the
non-holomorphic Ka hler potential  now contains quantum
corrections. The holomorphic  mass, , however, is the
same as it was at tree level,
 
as anticipated in section .



As the vacua with   
 are  supersymmetric, we  expect the vector fields
 (i.e., the  bosons) to acquire the same
mass () as their scalar superpartners by
absorbing the massless fields  in a supersymmetric Higgs
effect. This is again easy to verify: Just as in the tree level
case, the mass term for the vector fields arises from the square
of the covariant derivative D_C^a =
_C^a - k^a _b A_^b  which leads to the mass term
 
The corresponding kinetic terms are (see eq. ())
 
so that, remembering (),
     one  indeed   obtains the same mass matrices as above
 













Determining  We are now ready to determine the complete perturbative
prepotential  that
encodes the non-singular effective action 
. The defining property of 
 is that integrating out  and
 and going over to the variables  should
reproduce the singular   action  based on the
perturbative  prepotential

given  in Section .

As we are now going beyond tree level,    integrating out 
and  is no longer equivalent to simply setting these fields
equal to zero. Instead, one now also has to take into account
threshold effects that arise from Feynman
 diagrams in which  and  (or their
superpartners) run in loops.

In practice this means that  is
obtained from   in a
two-step process  (see also): First one sets
 in . This will then yield
an auxiliary prepotential 

  which only depends on  (or, alternatively, on
  ). If there were no threshold effects,
  this would already be the prepotential  in which the
 bosons have been integrated out. If threshold effects do
exist,
 however,
 and  will
differ by an additional term  which subsumes
all effective interactions that are generated by diagrams with
 and  running in loops, i.e., one has
 

In our case, the threshold corrections introduce a logarithmic
dependence on the holomorphic mass of the  gauge bosons
into the (Wilsonian) gauge couplings g_W^-2  = - b 16^2  m^2 , where
 is the one-loop coefficient of the -function. The
definition of the Wilsonian gauge coupling is exactly as in 
supergravity where  is determined by a holomorphic function
. In  supergravity  is determined by the
matrix of second derivatives of  and for the case
at hand we find
(Note that the non-holomorphic piece in the definition
() of  does not contribute to the harmonic 
Wilsonian gauge couplings.) 
gW  g_W^-2  =    14
(_-^2 + _-^2 ) =
1 4^2  m^2 , where we used . Note
that the definition of  includes the choice of a
(field-independent) cut-off scale which in supergravity has to be
proportional to the Planck mass. This in turn implies that the
right hand side of () is defined only up an arbitrary
additive constant. Using () this implies
 
where  is the arbitrary constant while 
are a priori undetermined functions of . The prepotentials
with and without the  bosons are thus related by
diff  = ^truncated _in 
 + 1 2^2  T_-^2T_-
+   T_- ^2  + (T_+ )T_-  + (T_+ ). As we see, integrating out  introduces a logarithmic
singularity into  while  has to be
non-singular. Thus we can now go backwards and compute 

 by first
subtracting the logarithmic divergence    from
, which is
   given by
() and ().  is then
obtained from  by replacing every
 by . For this to be possible, 
should appear in  only in terms of
even  powers (cf. ()). We will see whether this
is indeed the case.


The first step is therefore to expand  near  in order to
isolate the logarithmic singularity. The last term in
() is manifestly non-singular in this limit
while the second term can be expanded using (). In

invariant under . Viewed as a power
series in , it therefore also contains only even 
powers of . Furthermore, the only non-analytic piece is the
logarithmic term
 
Remembering (), we see that in 
  this term is precisely
  canceled
by the one-loop   threshold correction . Thus,
as desired,  is
 analytic
  near  and reads
 
As mentioned above, the full prepotential 
is now obtained from   by
reversing the truncation of the  bosons. At tree level,
this was done by simply promoting every  to the 
invariant combination . However, a   closer inspection
of ()
 reveals that
this is not possible here,  because there are cubic 
  powers of  which cannot
cancel against any other term (there are also linear terms in
, but we will discuss them later).

The source of this problem is of course that we are still working
with the variables    that were suitable for the
tree level approximation. As explained in Section ,
the loop corrected version instead requires  working with  the
quantities  in terms of which  the Weyl twist
 becomes diagonal. Only in
 terms of the variables  should one expect the prepotential
 to be even in . And
indeed, inserting () into (), one obtains
 
We see that the disturbing cubic terms in  have indeed
disappeared.


Let us now turn  to the terms quadratic in . As we discussed
above, the constant  is undetermined by the subtraction
procedure, and so one is   free to choose 
 in order to simplify eq. ().  

The  linear term
 
on the other hand, only leads to a constant shift in one of the numerous theta
angles. Such a term can always be neglected, because it is part of
the ambiguity in the prepotential 
we have mentioned below eq. (). The same is true
for the real part of a possible  constant term in  as
well as for a possible linear term in  with imaginary
coefficient. All other terms in , however, have to
vanish from the outset in
  order for  to appear only with even powers. Modulo
irrelevant changes in theta angles, we have  thus derived
 
The full prepotential  is then obtained by
simply replacing every  in () by
. 

It remains to determine 
the unknown function .
In principle, 
this could be done in a similar way as in our discussion following eq.  
() by considering the couplings , 

and . As the two multiplets we integrate out are not charged
with respect to the corresponding vector fields  and 
, the gauge couplings of the latter should not feel the shift 
  and remain unchanged in the integrating out process.
This would suggest . In   
the following two 
sections, we will see that this expectation is supported 
by a completely independent line of argument. As we will show, 
 is
already strongly constrained
by the quantum symmetry and the proper large radius limit.


Quantum symmetries of  


At  the original  quantum
symmetry reduces to the diagonal  acting on  and
 as SLdiag  T_+aT_+ -ibicT_++d  ,
T_- T_- . This symmetry should be respected by
, which we explicitly check in this section. In
addition, this consistency check will confirm that  is a
constant and further constrain   in eq.
().

The generic form of  is given in (),
which,  near , can be approximated by the first two terms
 _in (S ,T_+,C^a) = H_0(S, T_+)
+ H_1(S, T_+) C^aC^a + O (C^4) . Since we have
already determined the tree level contribution to these functions
in (), we can parameterize  and  more
conveniently by  H_0(S, T_+) =  -S T_+ ^2 + h(T_+) ,H_1(S, T_+) = S  + f(T_+) , where  can be viewed
as the loop corrections to the Kahler potential of  (also
known as the four-dimensional Green-Schwarz term
), while  is the one-loop correction to
the  gauge coupling. As we will show, appropriate
derivatives of  and  transform as modular forms which can be
computed from ().


Let us first focus on . For this coupling there is a
closely related computation we can make use of. In ref.
 the two-parameter -model was investigated. Its
prepotential including one-loop corrections is given by 
 with an  acting on .

Using arguments outlined in, it was shown in
 that  has to be a modular form of
weight . The exact same arguments can be used here to conclude
that   has to be a modular form of weight
. Furthermore, in the -model the second derivative
 has a logarithmic singularity at  which
arises from the fact that additional massless states appear at
 which lead to a gauge symmetry enhancement. However, in our
case the second derivative  has a logarithmic
singularity both at  and , since charged states
become massless at both  points. The coefficient of the
singularity is set by the -function of the gauge group
opening up. More precisely, one has _+^2 h(T_+) = + b_SU(2) 4^2  (T_+ -1) +
b_SU(3) 4^2  (T_+ -)+ finite  . Using  and  this implies
 sing 
_+^5 h(T_+) = -2^2  1(T_+ -1)^3 
- 3^2  1(T_+ -)^3  + finite  . In order to check the above singularity structure and the modular
properties,
 we will now compute  by relating it to the modular forms
(). Truncating out  from ()
gives
 
Hence,
 
where we have used () and () in the second and
 in the  third line. Using the explicit
form ()  of , we then obtain
 

In order to compute  it is
convenient to define Idef  I_= (_T^3 _U^3) ^(1)  , where the third derivatives of
 are given in (). Expanding  near
 one has I_+ &=& a_0(T_+) + a_2(T_+) T_-^2 + O(T_-^4) 

I_- &=& a_-1  T_-^-1   + a_1(T_+) T_- + O(T_-^3) 
where(This and some of the following calculations have been performed using Maple.) 
aexp 
a_-1  &=& 1 4^2  ,

a_0 &=&
-14  E_2 -14 E_4^2  E_6  ,

a_1&=& 23 216  E_4  +1 8E_2 ^2 +1 4

&&+4 27  
E_6^2 E_2  E_4^2  -  24  E_4^4  E_2

Expressing  in terms of

algebra hfinal 
 _+^5^(1) _T_- =0 
&=& (4_+^2 I_+ +32 _-^2 I_+ -
92 _-_+ I_-)_T_-=0 

&=& 4_+^2 a_0 - 92 _+ a_1 +3 a_2

&=& -2(E_4^6E_6^3  -23 18  E_4^3E_6 
+8 18 E_6^3E_4^3  -16 E_6) , where the last equation used repeatedly the derivatives of modular
forms given in appendix C. As expected  is
indeed  a modular form of weight . It also is closely related
to the corresponding quantity for the -model computed in
 but differs in the structure of the singularities to
which we turn to now.

In () we determined the singularities of 
 which differs from  by
the so far unknown  (c.f. ()).
However, as we are going to see shortly
 has precisely the right
singularity structure and modular properties to be exactly
  equal 
to  so that 
 has to vanish identically.
First of all, it is easy to see that
 does have a triple pole at
 and . Using () and expanding E_6(iT_+) &=& i E_6' (T_+-1) + 

E_4(iT_+) &=& i E_4' (T_+-) + we infer that near
 the leading singularity is _+^5^(1) _T_- =0  -2i E_4^6(i)E_6^3 (i) (T_+-1)^3  = -2^2  1(T_+-1)^3 
which is indeed consistent with (). Similarly, at
 the leading singularity is _+^5^(1) _T_- =0 
-8i 9 E_6^3()E_4^3 ()
(T_+-)^3  = -3^2  1(T_+-)^3  , again
consistent with (). Finally, from the dual type IIA
vacua we know that for large  the prepotential is at most a
cubic polynomial and hence _T_+  _+^5 h
= 0  . Using () we indeed check _T_+ 
_+^5^(1) _T_- =0  =  2(1-23 18 
+8 18  -16) =0 . 
We thus conclude
 
so that  can be at most a quartic polynomial in
.

In a similar fashion we can compute . Using
(), (), ()
 and , one first
derives
 
so that
 

Furthermore, using (), () and (), one
easily verifies
 
Differentiating twice yields (remembering )
_+^3 f = 23 _+^2 a_0
-16 _+^5 h . 
 From () and () and repeated use of
() we compute fresult 
_+^3 f = -
 108   E_2^3 + 4  E_2 E_4-2 9  E_6  - 36 E_2^2  E_4^2  E_6 -
 6  E_4^4 E_2  E_6^2  + 36  E_4^3   E_6 + 4 27 
E_6^3    E_4^3    . As we see, this expression is not a
modular form and singular both at  and at . However,
as was stressed in ref.  at one-loop the dilaton 
transforms under modular transformations. Nevertheless, it is
possible to define a modular invariant, non-singular dilaton
 via  S^inv  = S
-12_T_U^(1)  -18^2 
[j(iT)-j(iU)] . To see the modular properties of  we
need to separate   into the part which is redefined into
 and the left over piece  defined by
fcov  S + f = S^inv  + f^cov   . Using the
same strategy as before, we find
     Sind 
_+^3 S^inv _T_-=0  = -18 _+^5 h
+14 _+^3 f  -18^2  _+^3
[_+j] . Taking the third derivative of
() evaluated at  and inserting into ()
we arrive at _+^3 f^cov  = 34 _+^3 f +18 _+^5 h
+18^2  _+^3 [_+j] . Using
() and () this finally gives
fcfinal 
_+^3 f^cov  = 14^2  _+^3E_4(T_+)  .

We see that for  the result considerably simplified
compared to () and both the modular properties and
the singularity structure qualitatively changed. The right hand
side of () is singular only at 
corresponding to the enhancement  as
expected. At  on the other hand the enhancement is
 and no charged states
contribute to the  gauge couplings which is already present
at . Thus  has to be finite at  which is indeed
satisfied by the -term.

Let us close this section by checking  the modular properties of
.  From () we infer that  plays the
role of the one-loop corrections to the  gauge coupling. In
 supergravity the gauge couplings obey g^-2 
= (S+f) + b16^2  K(S,T_+,C^a=0)  , where
 is the tree level Kahler potential obtained
from ()  K= -(S+S) -2
(T_++T_+)  .   transforms under ()
according to KK +2 icT_+ +d^2 . Since the
physical gauge couplings  have to be modular invariant the
combination  has to compensate the
transformation (). Since  is modular
invariant by construction, the transformation law of  is
fixed to be f^cov f^cov  - b4^2  (icT_+
+d) = f^cov  + 1^2  (icT_+ +d) , where the
last equation used . Thus we conclude
fcfinall 
 f^cov  = 14^2  E_4(T_+)  
which is consistent with both () and ()
and fixed only up to an arbitrary constant, which can be identified with the
ambiguous constant  in ().





The Large Radius Limit 



In this section, we perform the large radius limit of the theory
and show the consistency of our results with the results obtained
in ref. (In fact, the results of
 were the motivation for the present analysis.)  for . In this
limit, one circle of the  is decompactified, and one obtains
heterotic string theory on . The
low energy limit of this theory is five-dimensional, 
supergravity coupled to  vector multiplets and 
hypermultiplets, where  count four-dimensional
supermultiplets. As before, the hypermultiplets can be
consistently ignored. The couplings of five-dimensional vector
multiplets to  supergravity are encoded in a cubic
prepotential. The vector multiplet moduli  are
real, rather than complex, and the moduli space is a cubic
hypersurface, V (T^i) = 16 C_ijk  T^i T^j T^k
! =  1 ,  where  is
the five-dimensional prepotential, the  denote a set of
constants,  and . The underlying structure is
often referred to as  'very special geometry' .



Dimensional reduction of the five-dimensional supergravity theory
defined by () over a circle of radius  gives
four-dimensional  supergravity with  vector multiplets
and a 'very special' (i.e., purely cubic) four-dimensional
prepotential: F (t^i) = 16 C_ijk  t^i t^j t^k .
 Here, the  are complex scalars whose real
parts are related to the  five-dimensional   scalars by Re   t^i = R T^i.The imaginary parts of
the  arise from the internal components of the
corresponding gauge fields. This means that in  a meaningful
decompactification limit the imaginary parts cannot have a vev,
and the  have to be restricted to real values. In the rest of
this section, this will always be assumed, i.e., from now on 
stands for , and inequalities such as ,
should be read as 
, etc.
With  restricted to real values, () and
() imply F (t^i) = 16 C_ijk  t^i t^j t^k
=R^3 .  Whereas a five-dimensional prepotential must be purely cubic, a
four-dimensional prepotential is, in general, allowed to be an
arbitrary holomorphic function of the  (possibly with
singularities on special loci). Therefore () and
() only represent the pure supergravity contribution
that can be (and typically is) subject to further stringy
corrections:
 F (t^i) = 16 C_ijk  t^i t^j t^k + = R^3 +
. If, however, such a four-dimensional prepotential
can be obtained by dimensional reduction from  five dimensions,
then these corrections must vanish in the decompactification limit
: _R   R^-3 
F (t^i) = V (T^i) . In order to make contact with, we need to switch to a
slightly different parameterization of the prepotential. This
corresponds, in the notation of, to going from
'heterotic' to 'type IIA' conventions: S 4 S
, F  -4 F . In this
convention, the prepotential without the  bosons (eqs.
(), ()) takes the form
neueVersion  F _>  = STU + 13 U^3 +
2 (2)^3  Li_3 ( e^-2 (T-U)  ) +
2 (2)^3  _k,l=0 ^  c_1(kl) Li_3 ( e^-2
(kT + lU)  ) . We indicated by our notation that
this expression is valid in the Weyl chamber(As explained
in the BPS states form an infinite dimensional Lie
algebra and one can generalize the notion of a Weyl chamber, which
is familiar from simple Lie algebras. In particular,  and
 define the two Weyl chambers of an  subalgebra. The
corresponding group is the gauge group which is un-Higgsed at
.)  . In order to perform the decompactification limit
inside this Weyl chamber we set , etc. and take 
, while keeping  fixed . Using
(), we find _R   R^-3 
F (S,T,U) = V (s,t,u) = stu + 13 u^3  ,
 which is precisely the same
prepotential as one obtains directly in five-dimensional heterotic
string theory.


The five-dimensional scalars
 are subject to the hypersurface constraint ().
One can express them in terms of two unconstrained scalars. The
natural choice for these scalars are the five-dimensional
heterotic dilaton , or, equivalently, the five-dimensional
heterotic string coupling  and
the radius  of the remaining circle. The relation between the
contrained scalars  and the uncontrained scalars 
is: s=  2   -  2
  3   r^3  , t =  2  
r    ,  u =   2     
r   . The regime  thus corresponds to 
, i.e.,
the radius of the circle is larger than the self-dual radius
 and the heterotic string is weakly coupled.



Let us now take a different decompactification limit, where the
hierarchy between the moduli  is reversed: . The
four-dimensional prepotential in this region is
found by analytical continuation of () using the
connection formula () for the polylogarithm: _<  &=& STU + 13 U^3 + 13 (T-U)^3 - i 2 
(T-U)^2 - 16 (T-U)  

 & & + 2 (2)^3  Li_3 ( e^-2 (U-T)  )
+ 2 (2)^3  _k,l=0 ^  c_1(kl) Li_3 ( e^-2
(kT + lU)  ) .  
Note that
() and () differ by polynomial
terms that come from the analytical continuation of 
. The additional cubic term will survive
in the decompactification limit although the polylogarithm itself
goes to zero. Thus one of the polylogarithmic terms 
leaves a subtle shadow in the decompactification
limit. Note that it is precisely this term which 
is responsible for the fact that the
prepotentials in the two Weyl chambers are not just related by
exchanging  and . Just as the
non-trivial monodromy around , this is caused by the
threshold corrections corresponding to the two charged vector
multiplets which become massless on this line.




The last term in (), which contains an infinite
number of further polylogarithmic terms,
is manifestly invariant under the exchange of 
 and  and does not contribute
to the monodromy of the prepotential around .
It contains the contributions
of the infinitely many other BPS states of the heterotic string.
This term is non-universal, in the sense that it depends
on details of the BPS spectrum. For example, it will be different
for the closely related model with instanton numbers . In
contrast, the first polylogarithmic term is universal in the sense
that it is fully determined by the fact that we have 
enhancement on the line .






We can now take the decompactification limit 
 and obtain 
V _<  = stu + 13 u^3 + 13 (t-u)^3 = stu
+ 13 t^3 + (tu^2 - t^2 u)  ,  valid
for . Comparing () and
() we see that the two prepotentials differ by
the term . This difference vanishes at , so the
prepotential itself is a continuous function at . The
resulting couplings in the Lagrangian, however, are discontinuous,
because they depend on derivatives of the prepotential. These
discontinuities in the couplings are the analogues of the
logarithmic branch cuts present in four dimensions.



Using five-dimensional field theory, one can show that
the difference  of the two prepotentials precisely
corresponds to the threshold corrections of two charged vector
multiplets.
This shows that at  the
 gauge group corresponding to the scalar  is enhanced
to . This result was in fact first found in
 by using perturbative heterotic string theory for
the compactification on . In terms of
five-dimensional heterotic variables, the second Weyl chamber
 corresponds to a small radius  of the
circle, and one recognizes the the  enhancement as the
usual  gauge symmetry enhancement at the self-dual radius
 of the circle.



Using the field redefinition 
, the prepotential () takes the form
 given in. The fact that this
form actually involves a field redefinition is crucial for the
study of space-time geometries where the scalars evolve
dynamically from  to . Indeed, a naive  use of 
 for  and 
 for , with the same  in both Weyl chambers,
leads to artificial space-time singularities, which are absent
when the correct continuation () is used
. 




Let us now  consider a third decompactification limit, where we
keep  small, so that we stay in the vicinity of
the enhancement locus. In this case, we should keep the charged
vector multiplets and work with the prepotential 
 or, for simplicity, with the truncated version
 (). In  the
conventions used in this section,  

  takes the following form(At this point, we have already used
.) :
 _in  ^truncated  
 &=& S(T_+ ^2 -T_- ^2 ) + 13  (T_+ -T_- )^3 +
 2 (2 )^3  (3) - 16  T_-   + 43  T_-^3 

& & + O(T_-^4)
  + 2 (2)^3 _k,l=0 ^  c_1(kl) Li_3
( e^-2 [(k+l)T_+  + (k-l) T_- ] 
) 

& & + 4 ( [+3 4^2  -12^2 (4)]
T_- ^2  +  (T_+ ) )  .




We will now show  that one gets a consistent decompactification
limit if one first takes  to zero and then takes  to
infinity. In order to keep track of the behaviour of the
prepotential away from the special locus , we use that the
five-dimensional prepotential is purely cubic and perform the
limit at the level of the third derivatives: _R
  _T_- 0   ^3
F ^truncated  _in      t^i t^j t^k   =  ^3 V ^truncated  _in     
T^i T^j T^K   , where  and
.




We illustrate this by computing the term cubic in . This term
is particularly important because it encodes the five-dimensional
  threshold corrections. From () we find:
_R   _T_- 0 
 ^3 F    T_-T_- T_-   = 6 (
-13 + 43 ) = 6 . This implies V _in  ^truncated   = t_-^3 + , where
we used () and () to show that the
contribution of the polylogarithms vanishes in the limit.


Looking at the other third derivatives and  ignoring the    term 
for the moment,
 we find V _in  ^truncated   = s (t_+^2 - t_-^2) + 13 (t_+
- t_-)^3 + 43 t_-^3 .  
To compare () with ()
and () we switch to the variables : V _in  ^truncated   = stu + 13 u^3 + 16
(t-u)^3 = 12 (V _>  + V _< ) . This is
precisely the truncated  five-dimensional prepotential derived in
. Just as in the four-dimensional case (section 4.2), a
 manifestly gauge invariant form is obtained by
introducing , which is the five-dimensional limit
of the Weyl-invariant dilaton (): V _in  ^truncated   = s  (t_+^2 - t_-^2)
+ 13 t_+^3 + t_+ t_-^2 .  In this basis all
fields   transform covariantly under the Weyl twist:  and
 are invariant, and  is mapped to . As 
only enters through the invariant , the 'untruncated'
prepotential is again obtained via a  substitution of the form
, where 
transform in the adjoint representation of .

We have thus shown that our decompactification limit of 
 is consistent with the purely five-dimensional 
 result 
() obtained in provided that 
the function  does not contribute to this limit, i.e., provided
that . 
From
Section , we already  know 
that  can be at most a quartic polynomial in 
. The five-dimensional   decompactification limit now tells us that
 can, in fact,  be at most a quadratic  polynomial:
. As mentioned earlier,
these remaining terms are expected to vanish as well, because
they would give rise to changes in the gauge couplings 
of the spectator vector fields 
 and  when the  multiplets 
are integrated out.



Conclusions 


In this paper, we have shown, in an explicit example, how to
determine a non-singular effective action near a singular subspace
of the moduli space of a string compactification. The key feature
of this effective action is that it includes modes that are
massive at a generic point in the moduli space but become massless
at the singularity. Starting from a singular effective action
where such modes have been integrated out, we carefully integrated
them back in and in this way derived an effective action valid in
the vicinity of the singularity, or, in other words, in a region of
 the moduli space where these modes are still light. Using a
combination of field-theoretical reasoning (the general structures
of  Yang-Mills-supergravity actions and of threshold
corrections) together with some (in fact, little) knowledge of the
underlying microscopical string physics (only the type of the
additional massless states were needed) and symmetry arguments
(the residual T-duality at a fixed point) turned out to be
sufficient to determine the effective theory up to a few
irrelevant integration constants.


It was clear from the outset that such a non-singular effective
action should exist, but we find it interesting and useful to carry out
this derivation explicitly and determine a complete and consistent
description of the low energy physics near the singularity. Our 
calculations have exhibited many features which we expect to be 
generic. In particular, we have seen that although the prepotential
is a very complicated function, which involves an infinite number
of polylogarithmic functions, integrating in the charged vector
multiplets basically amounts to adding a term of the form
. This term is fixed
by pure field theory arguments, and is complelely
determined by the knowledge that
two charged vector multiplets become massless at .
As we have seen, the resulting theory nevertheless 
has the  correct global
properties on the moduli space, i.e., it has the correct
singularities at the points 
of higher gauge symmetry enhancement
and exhibits the residual modular symmetry .
Modular symmetries are related to the presence of infinitely many
massive string states. What our results thus  demonstrate is  
that the field theory reasoning employed here
is able to capture such stringy properties.  
Also note that 
it is not completely obvious that () does not contain
odd powers of  apart from the first and the third. 
Since the infinitely many
massive modes do not interfere with the integrating in procedure 
we expect that the methods developed in this paper can be applied
to other cases as well.














 




For example, it would be interesting to extend our
results to conifold points and conifold transitions in type II
string compactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds. This
corresponds to situations where hypermultiplets
become massless, and we must distinguish between statements about the
vector multiplet sector and about the hypermultiplet sector. The
vector multiplet sector is still determined by its prepotential,
but now the singularities and monodromies of the generic prepotential
are not due to 
gauge symmetry enhancement, but to massless monopoles and dyons.
Integrating in these hypermultiplets must remove the non-trivial
monodromies of the prepotential around the conifold locus. 
Given the monodromies, one should be able to integrate in the
hypermultiplets in the same way as the vector multiplets considered
in this paper. Note that although the  gauge symmetry is never
restored, it nevertheless leaves its imprint in the monopole and
dyon monodromies, as explained in.





It is much harder to say anything concrete about the
hypermultiplet sector, due to our lack of knowledge about generic
quaternionic manifolds. Whereas we can start in the vector
multiplet sector from a known prepotential, the metric on the
hypermultiplet moduli space is not known for the -model.
Therefore, any extension of our knowledge on this sector of the
theory is extremely valuable. One interesting question is the
structure of the metric and of the scalar potential in the
effective theory where the monopole hypermultiplets have been
integrated in. The particular structure of the scalar potential
corresponds to a non-generic gauging of the supergravity
Lagrangean (since one still has many flat directions) and requires
the hypermultiplet manifold to have specific isometries. It should
be interesting to investigate this in detail.


Another direction is the investigation of higher rank non-abelian
gauge groups in the perturbative heterotic string. This will
require a generalization of the present formalism, since, at least
in our example, these higher gauge symmetry enhancements cannot be
described in a basis for the symplectic section where a
prepotential exists. A reformulation purely in terms of sections
should also be useful for studying  non-Abelian gauge symmetry
enhancement in type II Calabi-Yau compactifications 
. 
Persuing this line of developement,
we expect to get a better understanding of the relation between
gauged supergravity, the geometry of Calabi-Yau manifolds and
M-theory.















Appendix  


 gauged supergravity in  In this appendix we collect the some facts about gauged 
supergravity in . A generic spectrum
contains the gravitational multiplet which contains the graviton

bosonic components. In addition there can be  vector
multiplets which feature  vector bosons  and 
complex scalars  as bosonic components.
Finally there are   hypermultiplets which contain  real
scalars . The bosonic part of the effective
action reads(Our  normalizations coincide with
 those of

quaternionic manifold, , spanned by the scalars  in the
hypermultiplets. As this part of the action is of no
importance for this paper we do not discuss them any further and
instead refer the reader to the literature. The metric
 is the metric on a special Kahler manifold,
, spanned by the scalars . Being special Kahler,
 can be derived from a  Kahler potential via

holomorphic prepotential  according to

The covariant derivatives are given by

we do not discuss  this situation here.)

Polylogology 

In this appendix we assemble facts and useful formulae for
polylogarithmic functions, as they can be found, for example, in
refs. .


For , the k-th  polylog is defined by the series expansion
Li_k(z) = _n=1 ^  z^n n^k  .
 It can be continued to a multivalued
function on the complex plane. Polylogarithmic functions with
different values of  are related by the equation z
d dz  Li_k(z) = Li_k-1 (z) .  Whereas the first polylog is related to the logarithm, Li_1(z)
= - (1-z) , the polylogs with  are algebraic
functions: Li_0(z) = z 1-z  ,  Li_k(z) = (
z d dz  )^-k  z 1-z      for    
k-1 . From () one can derive integral
representations for the higher polylogs, , but we will
not need them. But in order to describe the behaviour of the
prepotential in the decompactification limit and on the
enhancement locus we need the following special
values:( has a -th order pole at  for
, whereas  diverges logarithmically for 
.)  Li_k(0) = 0 ,(k Z )
 and  Li_k(1) = (k) ,
for k>1.  The connection formula relates the values at 
and : Li_k(z) + (-1)^k Li_k ( 1z  ) = - (2
i)^k k!  B_k (  (z)   2 i  ) ,
for     k > 0 , where  are the
Bernoulli polynomials.(There is an analogous equation for
, where the right  hand   side is zero.)  For  one
finds Li_3(z) - Li_3(1z) = - 16 ^3(z) - i 2
^2(z) + ^2 3 (z).

 For our purposes it is more natural to work
with the variable , where . In the main part of the
paper,  is a modulus or a linear combination of moduli, and 
 corresponds to gauge symmetry enhancement,
while 
corresponds to the decompactification limit. In terms of the
variable , formula () becomes Li_3(e^x) = Li_3 (e^-x ) + ^2 3  x - i  2 
x^2 - 1 6  x^3  .  The function  has a logarithmic branch point at
. Since this limit is relevant for the study of gauge
symmetry enhancement, it is useful to have an expansion of the
form Li_3 (e^-x ) p(x) + q(x) (x)    for
  x 0 ,  where 
and  are power series, p(x) = _j=0 ^  p_j
x^j    and    q(x) = _j=0 ^  q_j x^j . This expansion can be analytically continued to an expansion for
, using . Plugging this
into the connection formula () and comparing term by
term one finds: q_0 = q_1 =0 ,  q_2 = - 1 2 
,  q_3 = q_4 = q_5 = = 0 and p_1 = -
^2 6  ,  p_3 = 1 12  , p_5 = p_7
= p_9 = = 0 . The coefficients , 
 can be obtained using ().  is fixed
by  while the other coefficients can be found
by comparing derivatives of () with
(). In particular, the second derivative
fixes . Combining all our results we have
(Our formula specifies some terms which were not
displayed in. Ref.  suggests the
existence of terms of the form , but as we have
seen these are absent. Our formula is consistent with eq. (8.5)
of after the change  of variables . We
thank G. Cardoso for discussions on this issue.) 
 Li_3(e^-x ) p(x) - 1 2 
x^2  (x)  , where even 
 p(x) = (3) -
^2 6  x + 3 4  x^2 + 1 12  x^3
 + O(x^2n ) , n= 2,3,4,Note that the higher terms in  are even powers of .
The odd powers, except the linear and the cubic term, are ruled
out by the connection formula. This is important for our
discussion of gauge symmetry.




To analyze the decompactification limit we need the first formula
of (), or, being more precise about the
asymptotics, Li_3 (e^-x ) e^-x 
,for  x .
 




















Modular Forms  

The modular group is defined by the following transformation:(
It is common to choose a different convention for  where real
and imaginary part are exchanged. More precisely, for 
one has .) 

modtr  T aT -ibicT + d  , ad - bc =
1 , a,b,c,d Z  .On the fundamental domain of
this transformation there are two fixed points at  and
.

A modular form  of weight  is defined to be
holomorphic and to obey the transformation law modform 
E_k(iT) (icT+d)^k E_k(iT)  .  One can
show that there are no modular forms of weight 0 and 2, while at
weight 4 and 6 one has the Eisenstein functions E_4 (q)&
&  1 + 240 _n=1 ^n^3 q^n 1-q^n 
        = 1 + 240 q + 2160 q^2  ,

E_6 (q) &&  1 - 504 _n=1 ^n^5 q^n 1-q^n 
 = 1 - 504 q -16632 q^2  ,  where
. From their definition one immediately
infers that they have been normalized such that Enorm 
_T  E_4 = 1 = _T  E_6 . Furthermore, both function have no pole on the fundamental domain
and  has exactly one simple zero at , while  has
one simple zero at 
Eprop  E_4(i) 0 , E_4(i)= 0 , E_6(i) = 0 , E_6(i)0 .
One can construct modular forms of arbitrary even weight from
products of these two Eisenstein functions.

A modular form which vanishes at  is called a cusp form.
There is no cusp form of weight  and for  there is
the unique cusp form  where (q) q^124  _n=1 ^(1-q^n) , ^24  =
E_4^3 -E_6^21728   is the Dedekind
-function. ( does not vanish at  or .)

One can also construct modular invariant functions but such a function
necessarily has a pole somewhere on the fundamental domain. The
-function defined by j(q)   E_4^3^24  
= E_6^2^24   +  1728 E_4^3E_4^3 - E_6^2  =
q^-1  + 744 + 196884 q +  has a simple
pole at  and a triple zero at .


Finally, the  Eisenstein series  is defined by E_2(iT) =
1 - 24 _n=1 ^  n q^n1- q^n  .  is
holomorphic, but not quite a modular form: E_2 ( icT + d)^2
E_2 (iT) + 6c i   ( icT + d ) . The derivative of a modular form is in general not a modular form.
But using the transformation properties of  one defines the
modular covariant derivative Df(iT) := f'(iT) - ki 6   E_2(iT) f(iT)  , where the prime denotes
differentiation with the respect to the argument, i.e.  
. The covariant derivative maps
modular forms of degree  to modular forms of degree . Its
action on normalized Eisenstein series is DE_k(iT)  = - k 
i 6   E_k + 2 (iT) for . This can
be used to express derivatives of Eisenstein series in terms of
the Eisenstein series themselves. For  we also have a
relation: E_2' - i 6  E_2 E_2 =  - i 6 
E_4 .Also note that all higher Eisenstein series , with
 are homogenous polynomials in  (the
ring of modular forms is generated by ). For example: E_8 = E_4^2 , E_10  = E_4 E_6 .In the text we need the
following derivatives: Ederivatives 
E_4' &=& 2 i 3  ( E_4 E_2 - E_6 ) ,

E_6' &=& i ( E_6 E_2 - E_8) = i (E_6 E_2 - E_4^2) ,

j' &=& - 2 i j  E_6 E_4  = - 2 i E_4^2 E_6
^-24  .The logarithmic derivative of
 is proportional to : (^-24 )' = - 2 i ^-24  E_2 . As we just saw the derivative of a modular form is not a modular
form, since it does not satisfy eq. () in general. An
exception is the derivative  which
transforms according to modder 
_T^n F_1-n (icT+d)^(n+1) _T^n F_1-n 
and thus is a modular form of weight .
