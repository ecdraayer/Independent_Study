 boundary supersymmetry in integrable models

and perturbed boundary conformal field theory - 0.1mm 
 Abstract 
Boundary integrable models with  supersymmetry are considered. For the simplest boundary  superconformal minimal
model with a Chebyshev bulk perturbation 
we show explicitly how fermionic boundary degrees of freedom arise naturally in
the boundary perturbation in order to maintain integrability and  supersymmetry. A new boundary reflection matrix is obtained for this model and  boundary superalgebra is studied. A factorized scattering theory is proposed for a  supersymmetric extension of the boundary sine-Gordon model with either  fermionic or  bosonic and fermionic boundary degrees of freedom. Exact results are obtained for some quantum impurity problems: the boundary scaling Lee-Yang model, a massive deformation of the anisotropic Kondo model at the filling values  and the boundary Ashkin-Teller model.

Introduction 
In superstring theory, it has recently been shown that certain backgrounds are associated with two-dimensional integrable massive field theories on the worldsheet. For instance, the sine-Gordon model at its  supersymmetric point corresponds to the simplest generalization of the pp-wave background and the  supersymmetric sine-Gordon model was suggested as a good string background. Similarly, for open superstrings boundary integrable models with  supersymmetry arise naturally. Exact results
for such integrable field theories are then desirable. 

In statistical physics, several low-dimensional systems around their critical points possess a description in terms of two-dimensional integrable boundary  quantum field theories. Among the famous examples, one finds the Kondo model 
which describes the s-wave scattering of electrons off a magnetic spin impurity.
Another example corresponds to free fermions on the half-line  which describes the scattering of fermions off a monopole (Callan-Rubakov effect). Also, minimal models and their extensions (with  supersymmetry or -symmetry) arise in quantum impurity problems. Although nonperturbative results for (pure) bulk perturbation can be derived using certain quantum group restrictions of  (super)sine-Gordon, Bullough-Dodd or more generally affine Toda models, in case of an integrable boundary perturbation such a relation is still an open problem which needs further analysis. 

As explained in, a boundary perturbation of a massive
integrable quantum field theory will
preserve integrability if the perturbing boundary operator possesses a 
representation with respect to the underlying chiral algebra on the
half-plane(This can be shown in first order of conformal
perturbation theory. If operators are very relevant, scaling arguments 
can be used to show that local conserved currents exists at all
orders in conformal perturbation theory.)  and  provided it belongs to the same representation than 
the bulk potential. It is important to mention that the choice of
conformal boundary conditions plays a crucial role as it restricts the
representations of the boundary operators. 

Among the simplest known examples, one finds the critical Ising
field theory (with central charge ) perturbed by the energy
operator  in the bulk ( representation of the Virasoro
algebra). Due to the argument recalled above, it follows
that a boundary operator in the  representation leads to a
boundary integrable model. Indeed, from the fusion rule of the spin
operator  a boundary
integrable model can be constructed as an off-critical Ising model
restricted on the half-line with free conformal boundary conditions
perturbed by a boundary spin operator coupled with one fermionic boundary degree 
of freedom. 

As mentionned in, it would be interesting to construct a
 nontrivial boundary integrable perturbation of a critical Ising 
field theory on the half-line perturbed by a relevant magnetic operator in
the bulk ( representation). Indeed, if one starts with
standard boundary conditions (free or fixed), one simply cannot obtain 
a boundary operator in the representation of the Virasoro
algebra. Starting from certain boundary conditions
changing operators, it is however expected that one might
be able to construct a well-defined boundary operator that preserves
integrability. But in this case, the underlying boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) with these
special boundary conditions has to be identified, which remains an
open question. In order to solve this problem, it has been pointed out 
that introducing new degrees of freedom located at the boundary might
provide a useful tool.

In both previous examples, a perturbed boundary minimal model (critical
Ising field theory) is considered for which the
representations of the Virasoro algebra (labeled by the conformal
weights) are in finite number. Fusion rules then restrict drastically
the number of models that can be constructed(For
boundary conformal field theories with higher
symmetries such as -minimal models,  
models,... the same situation occurs. For a discussion about
the relation between boundary Toda models with imaginary coupling and
perturbed boundary -minimal models, see for instance
.) . It is probably one reason why the presence of boundary 
degrees of freedom seems to be sometimes necessary. 

On the other hand, we may now wonder if boundary degrees of freedom occur in case of BCFTs with a continuous serie of representations like the Liouville
or, more generally, Toda field theories perturbed simultaneously by bulk 
and
boundary operators in the same representation. An
interesting example is provided by the sine-Gordon (SG) field theory on the
half-line  without or withdegrees of  freedom at the boundary. In full 
generality, we define its Euclidean action as:

A _bSG =_- ^ dy_- ^0 dx
(1 8 (_)^2-2())
+ _- ^ dy _pert ^B (y) + 
A _boundary   
where the interaction between the SG field and the
boundary terms    with dimension   
 reads

_pert ^B (y)  = E _-(y) e^i(0,y)/2 
+ E _+(y) e^-i(0,y)/2  . 
Here we used the notation  and introduced
the UV mass parameter . The last term only depends on the
boundary degrees of freedom, and is only considered if necessary.

If there are no
degrees of freedom at the boundary, the terms  
  are just -numbers and we set  
   in (). This two-parameter
family(Only boundary parameters are mentionned here. The
bulk mass is sometimes considered as a third (bulk) parameter.)  of boundary 
integrable models have
been studied in details since many years, for which exact results

 have been confirmed using various methods. This model can be
 considered as an integrable
perturbation of the boundary Liouville field theory as suggested in
. Using vertex
operators representations, it is not difficult to
see in () that the boundary perturbing operators are
indeed in the same representation than the
bulk ones (for identical bulk and boundary background charges). Without boundary degrees of freedom, the UV limit of the boundary SG 
model defined in () can be identified either with the Gaussian field with Neumann boundary conditions or with the boundary Liouville field theory as considered in. 
 
For certain degrees of freedom at the boundary and generic values of the coupling , the classical
Hamiltonian  associated with the model () above is
integrable. At quantum level, integrability is
preserved for   

E _+(y)=2e_UV 1-^2 ^2 (y)      
and     
E _-(y)=2e_UV 1-^2 ^2 (y) 
with  
  and    is a boundary mass parameter. Depending on each sign in (), the boundary quantization length    
 associated with the boundary quantum mechanical system is fixed to

(^2-1) ^2 
(+)       or       2(^2-2) ^2  (-) . 
Introducing a "dynamical" extension of the Cartan subalgebra (identified with the topological
charge in the SG model) and using the boundary quantum group structure discovered in(This structure has been further studied in for which new reflection matrices associated with non-dynamical boundary have been obtained.)  
(coideal subalgebra of ), we obtained the 
soliton/antisoliton and breathers boundary reflection matrices. 
In particular, for generic values of the coupling ,
we found that the bulk and the boundary masses are locked
together(The UV parameter   is fixed by the boundary non-local
conserved charges algebraic structure in terms of the bulk UV mass parameter . Although
not shown explictly, Warner predicted such phenomena.) . We refer the reader to
 for more details.

For generic values of the coupling , this model deserves
certainly some interest, but taking some special values provides interesting new insights as we are going to show. Indeed, for    with    integers the bulk SG model is known to be related with the  bulk perturbation of minimal models. Furthermore, at the special point  (repulsive regime) it describes an integrable bulk perturbation (Chebyshev type) of  superconformal minimal model. The SG model with boundary degrees of freedom introduced and studied in being the most general boundary integrable perturbation of the bulk SG model, it is important to analyse in details these special points.

In this paper we will focus on ,   in () for several reasons. First, it will provide new examples of perturbed conformal field theories with boundary degrees of freedom for which the factorized scattering theory is proposed.  
Secondly, for generic values of the coupling  
the model () only possesses one free parameter (the bulk mass). It is important to see if different boundary operators 
preserving  integability can be constructed at these special points
for which new free parameters may appear. Third, for   a massive  boundary supersymmetry algebra appears explicitly.

The paper is organized as follow. In the next section, we exhibit an exact relation between  the simplest bulk-boundary perturbed  superconformal minimal model and the sine-Gordon model at special point  with fermionic boundary degrees of freedom. It shows that, similarly to the
critical Ising model in a boundary magnetic field, boundary degrees of 
freedom appear naturally in this model. 
The boundary supersymmetric charges are explicitly constructed from the Lagrangean and differ from the ones proposed in.
Although their expressions are similar to the ones in (which may probably be considered as "effective" supersymmetry charges in terms of the boundary structure) the main difference here is the fermionic boundary algebra
that appears associated with the fermion number operator. 
These supersymmetry charges are used to construct a new boundary reflection matrix with  supersymmetry which possesses two free parameters and is shown to satisfy the boundary Yang-Baxter equations. The corresponding massive  boundary superalgebra is constructed and the boundary free energy is proposed. 
In section 3, a boundary scattering associated with a  supersymmetric version of the boundary sine-Gordon model with purely fermionic (proposed in) or a mixing of fermionic and bosonic boundary degrees of freedom is proposed. In any case, the supersymmetric part is different from the one suggested in.  In section 4, we present applications of our results to quantum impurity problems. The boundary scaling Lee-Yang model is revisited in light of our results. The anisotropic Kondo model is shown to admit a simple massive integrable extension at special points  with , for which scattering amplitudes are proposed. Finally, a boundary version of the Ashkin-Teller model is briefly presented. 


 supersymmetry in the boundary sine-Gordon model 

Among the class of relevant perturbation of  superconformal
minimal model with central charge , the ones corresponding
to integrable  supersymmetric field theories have been studied in 
details. Three different types of relevant bulk perturbations can be
considered. Here, we focus on the model associated with a perturbation 
of the form (the so-called Chebyshev perturbation):

_pert ^bulk (z,)= 
G_-1 2  ^-G_-1 2  ^-  _k^+(z,)   +
  
G_-1 2  ^+G_-1 2  ^+  _k^-(z,) , 

where  is a complex parameter that characterizes the
strength of the perturbation. The chiral primary fields 
possess conformal dimensions    
and     are
 supersymmetry generators. Actually, this perturbation is known to be
the  superconformal analogue of the energy perturbation
of the ordinary critical Ising model. Following the case of the
off-critical Ising model in a boundary magnetic field and in order
to maintain supersymmetry (see details in), it is then
natural to consider the model with the bulk perturbation
() on the half-line and a boundary perturbation of the
form:

_pert ^boundary (y)= _B e^-i_0/3   ^uv  _-(y) 
G_-1 2  ^- _k ^+(y)  
+  _B e^i_0/3    ^uv  _+(y) G_-1 2  ^+ _k ^-(y)
 . 

Here  are boundary operators in
the same  superconformal representation as the bulk operators,  is a phase and  is the boundary mass scale. It 
is important to stress that the resulting model is neither expected to be
integrable nor  supersymmetric for any boundary degrees of freedom . Also, both requirement
must be simultaneously consistent. This can be checked from the
structure of the Lagrangean, but also in the scattering amplitude. To
proceed further, let us consider a concrete example: the sine-Gordon model
at .







In the bulk and for  the simplest  superconformal minimal model possesses a Lagrangean representation in terms of a single free boson  compactified on the "supersymmetric" radius. In terms
of its holomorphic and antiholomorphic parts it reads    with  and .  If 
we denote the expectation value over the Fock vacuum space of massless fields
 , then the holomorphic/antiholomorphic components  are normalized such that

 (z)  (w)_0=-(z-w), (z ) (w )
_0=-(z -w ), (z) (w )
_0=0 .
The  supersymmetric generators correspond to the stress-energy
tensor which ensures conformal invariance, the  current and the two supersymmetry generators. Their holomorphic parts read, respectively,

T(z)=-1 2 (_z)^2 ,J(z)=i 3 _z and G^ (z)=(i3 (z) ) .
The order parameter and its conjugate are defined as    . Using the definitions () above,
it follows that the interacting terms in the bulk perturbation 
() become

G_-1 2  ^G_-1 2  ^  
_k^(z,)=(2i 3 ((z)+() )) .


On the half-line, one can use the method of mirror images for Neumann 
boundary conditions    i.e.  one defines   . In terms of its holomorphic and antiholomorphic part restricted on the half-line it gives 

(z)= (z) + (z) and   (z)= () + () .

from which one deduces the two-point functions in the BCFT with Neumann 
boundary conditions 

 (z)  (w)_0=-2(z-w),  (z )  (w )_0=-2(z -w ), (z)  (w )_0=-2(z-w ) . 
In particular, from these definitions(One has    which gives  .)  and using the supersymmetric generators restricted on the half-line  
  the boundary perturbation becomes 

G_-1 2  ^_k^(y)(i 3 
((z)+() ))_x=0 =(i 3 
((0,y) )) .

It follows that the action associated with the simplest  boundary superconformal minimal model corresponds to the boundary sine-Gordon model 
() at the special point  with the substitutions 

      -   =  -    and  E _ (y)     _Be^i_0/3  ^uv  _ (y) .

At the supersymmetric point, the bulk SG model is in the repulsive 
regime (no breathers): the spectrum consists of one soliton and one antisoliton.
In the following, they are denoted    and    with fermion number    and    , respectively and form a two dimensional supermultiplet. The corresponding bulk -matrix is known for a long time . For general values of the coupling in the SG model, four nonlocal charges with fractional spin and one topological charge generating the  affine quantum envelopping algebra exist.  However, at  they become local (spin ) and together with the fermion number operator they generate the massive superalgebra. If  denotes the particle rapidity and  its mass, in the supermultiplet representation  they act as

&&_(Q  _+ )d()2M  e^/2 u()
, 
_(Q  _- )u()2M  e^-/2 d() ,

&&_(Q  _- )u()2M  e^/2 d()
, _(Q  _+ )d()2M  e^-/2 u() 
and 

Fu()1 2 u() , Fd()1 2 d() .

Using this representation, the massive superalgebra can be constructed in terms of the Hamiltonian , momentum  and particle number  with eigenvalues on one-particle states ,
 and 1 or 0, respectively. Using the definition of the coproduct which acts on multiparticle states one 
can check that the bulk -matrix commutes with these supercharges and the fermion number operator.

If we now consider the SG model on the half-line at the special value 
 as defined above (), using the results of 
 together with a scale transformation it follows that the boundary supercharges 

Q  _ =Q _ +Q  _ + ^ir  _ (-1)^F   with   ^ir  _ =2M  k  ^ir  _ 
 are conserved(To do that, one uses the local expression of the supercharges in terms of the field and derives their conservation in first order of conformal perturbation theory. Using scaling arguments, it can be shown that this is true at all orders too, which allows to define them asymptotically i.e. in the IR limit.) . Here  denotes a real parameter.
 To relate the IR and UV data (using the relation in the UV of the sine-Gordon non-local charges and the supercharges), asymptotically  we have assumed the boundary conditions for the operators 
  at both "ends" of the boundary:  

^uv  _+ (y=)^ir  _+ and ^uv  _- (y=)^ir  _-  .
Similarly to the boundary SG model with  boundary degrees of freedom, the asymptotic boundary operators  commute with the 
massive (bulk)  superalgebra. Thus we have

_(Q  _ )^u_u=-i ^ir  _
, _(Q  _ )^u_d=2M   e^/2  ,
_(Q  _ )^d_u=2M   e^/2  
,_(Q  _ )^d_d= i ^ir  _ 
If we impose  boundary supersymmetry in the quantum model, the supercharges () must commute with the boundary reflection matrix. Then, we are looking for the "minimal" solution of the dynamical extension of the intertwining equation considered in:

K_susy   ^_()_(Q  _ ) ^__- (Q  _ ) ^_K_susy   ^_() 
where indices    refer to two-dimensional supermultiplet representation  on
asymptotic soliton states  , . Then,
using this representation the solution  is written as
a  matrix with entries expressed in terms of the
boundary operators. In the non-dynamical case, the entries are
just analytic functions of  as  are
numbers. Let us define

K_susy   ^u_u()=A() ,K_susy   ^u_d()=B() ,

K_susy   ^d_u()=D() ,K_susy   ^d_d()=E() .
After some calculations, we find that the entries of the minimal
solution  of the intertwining equation
() takes the following form:

&&A()=( e^/2 ^ir  _+    +    e^-/2 ^ir  _- )/k2    ,
B()=( -i()   +    i(+1) k^2  [^ir  _+,^ir  _-] )/2 ,

&&E()=( e^/2 ^ir  _-    +    e^-/2 ^ir  _+ )/k2  ,  D()=( -i()   +   i(k^2  [^ir  _+,^ir  _-] )/2 ,
where the boundary operators satisfy 

^ir  _,[^ir  _+,^ir  _-]=0 and  
[(^ir  _ )^2,^ir  _+]=0  .
Here  is a real parameter.
One obvious realization is  in which case we recover the Ghoshal-Zamolodchikov-DeVega-Gonzalez-Ruiz minimal solution
. An other solution to () is to introduce a dimensionless complex fermion at the boundary ,   such that using (), asymptotically it satisfies

b ,b =b ^,b ^=0 and  b ,b ^=1 with b ()b  .
Together with the asymptotics () we choose the representation  in (), where  are Pauli matrices which act on the (pure) boundary space of states. In the Lagrangean () with (), it leads to the choice

^uv  _+ (y)=   b (y) and ^uv  _- (y)=  b ^(y)   . 

We would like to stress that the minimal part () with () of the boundary reflection matrix associated with the SG model at its  supersymmetric point possesses two free parameters  . In full generality, one may choose to introduce a phase  in front of  in (). However this phase can be removed using a gauge transformation over the fermionic boundary degrees of freedom. 



Boundary Yang-Baxter equations and boundary reflection matrix 
In the bulk, the perturbed  superconformal minimal model (the SG model at ) is massive and integrable. Integrability imposes strong constraints on the system which implies that the -matrix has to satisfy
the quantum Yang-Baxter equations. The entries at  read for :

S_susy   ^ _ ()a()=(u/2)Z(u) , S_susy   ^ _ ()b()=(u/2)Z(u) , S_susy   ^ _ ()c()=Z(u)  

and vanish otherwize. The factor  ensures unitarity and crossing symmetry of the -matrix. Its exact expression can be found in. 

For boundary integrable field theories, the soliton/antisoliton reflection matrix is constrained by the boundary Yang-Baxter 
equations (the so-called reflection equations). In our case, it reads  and obeys

 S_susy  (R_susy   ()S_susy  (+R_susy   (=R_susy   (susy  (+R_susy   ()S_susy  (

where we used the  notations ,
. If  supersymmetry is preserved, we write it 
in terms of the solution () as

R_susy  ()=K_susy  ()Y_susy  ()
, 

where the scalar factor  has to be determined using some
physical assumptions (see below). Recalling the definition of the entries
() it leads to
fourteen functional equations:

 (i)&&a_-c_+
 (B D' -B' D )+a_-a_+
 [A ,A']=0 ,

(ii) &&b_-b_+
 [A, E']+
 c_-c_+
 [E ,E']+ c_-a_+
 (D B' -D' B )=0 ,

(iii)&&c_-b_+
 (E A'-E'A )+ b_-c_+
 (A A'-E'E)+ b_-a_+
 [B,D']=0 ,

(iv)&&b_-b_+AD'  +
 c_-c_+ED'+ c_-a_+DA'
 - a_-a_+D' A - a_-c_+E'D=0 ,

 (v)&&b_-b_+B'A+ c_-c_+ B'E+ c_-a_+A'B- a_-a_+A B'- a_-c_+BE'= 0 ,

(vi)&&b_-b_+D'E+ c_-c_+D'A+ c_-a_+E'D- a_-a_+ED'- a_-c_+DA'=0 ,

(vii)&&b_-b_+EB'+ c_-c_+AB'+ c_-a_+BE'- a_-a_+B'E- a_-c_+A'B= 0 ,

(viii)&&b_-a_+BE' +
  c_-b_+EB'+ b_-c_+AB'
 - a_-b_+E'B=0 ,

(ix)&&b_-a_+A'B+ c_-b_+B'A+ b_-c_+B'E- a_-b_+BA'=0 ,

(x)&&b_-a_+E'D+ c_-b_+D'E+ b_-c_+D'A- a_-b_+DE'=0 ,

(xi)&&b_-a_+DA'+ c_-b_+AD'+ b_-c_+ED'- a_-b_+A'D=0 , 
where we used the shorthand notations ,
 and similarly for  and  as well as
 and  and similarly for  and
. The remaining three equations are obtained from ,
,  through the substitutions  and
. Straightforward  calculations show that
 given by () with () indeed satisfies all reflection equations above. 

In, Ghoshal and Zamolodchikov proposed the use of the "boundary unitarity" and "boundary cross-unitarity" conditions to determine the overall factor  associated with a
non-dynamical boundary. In case of a dynamical boundary, it can be applied directly and gives the following equations:

&&  Boundary unitarity:    R_susy   ^a_c()
R_susy   ^c_b(-)=
^a_bI   ;

&&  Boundary cross-unitarity:  R_susy   ^b_a 
(i/2-)=
S_susy   ^ab _a'b' (2)R_susy   ^a' _b' (i/2+) ,

where the
operator  denotes the identity which acts trivially on
the boundary ground state. We refer the reader to for details.
Let us now introduce two meromorphic functions    and   such that the prefactor in () is written

Y_susy  ()=Y^susy  _0 ()Y^susy  _1 () .

Using the explicit expressions  (),  they are chosen such that they solve the functional equations

&&Y^susy  _0()Y^susy  _0(-) = 1  , 

&&Y^susy  _0(i/2-) = (u) Z(2u) 
 Y^susy  _0(i/2+) , 

&&Y^susy  _1()Y^susy  _1(-) =
 [ -^2(u/2)^2(u/2) - 1 k^2 ^2(u/2) + 1-^2+2k^2 4k^4 ]^-1  ,

&& Y^susy  _1(i/2-) = Y^susy  _1(i/2+)

in order to have () and (). Using the results of and for   we finally obtain

Y^susy  _0()=R_0(u)G_0(u)_refmat 
where we used
R_0(u)=_k=1 ^ [(4k
-2u/)(1+4(k-1) -2u/) ((4k-3) -2u/)(1+(4k-1) -2u/) /(u
and
G_0(u)=
_k=1 ^ [(1+(4k-2)u/)((4k-2)u/) ((4k-4)u/)(1+4ku/) /(u.
 
The other part is given by

Y^susy  _1()=(,u)(i,u) 
()() _
with
(x,v) = x (x+v) _l=1 ^ [(1/2+(2l-1)+x/v/)(1/2+(2l-1)v/) (1/2+(2l-2)v/)(1/2+2l+x/v/) /(v .
Here    and    are two real IR boundary parameters related 
with    and the parameter     by

()()=-1 k     and   
^2()+^2()=1+1 k^2  .
Using these definitions, the parameter    entering in the boundary reflection  matrix  () with () and () becomes

_ = 1  -   2k^2(2)   .
It should be stressed that appart from the commutative case , there are no values of the parameters for which the boundary reflection matrix ()  reduces to the Ghoshal-Zamolodchikov one. Furthermore, we also checked that our solution can not be obtained from the Ghoshal-Zamolodchikov one using the fusion procedure suggested in. Notice that for the commutative case the exact relations between the IR boundary parameters    and  
the UV boundary parameters have been obtained by Al.B. Zamolodchikov and are supported by truncated conformal space analysis. 

The massive  boundary superalgebra and boundary free energy 
Let us now see in which manner the presence of boundary fermionic degrees of freedom affects the  supersymmetry algebra. To see this, one can use the  
one-particle asymptotic states  representation () as before. They provide a representation  for the  massive superalgebra
&&Q _+,Q _-=2(H+P) ,Q  _+,Q  _-=2(H-P)
 , Q  _+,Q  _-=2MN  ,  Q  _-,Q  _+=2MN  , 

&&Q  _^2=Q  _^2=0 and  Q  _,F=Q  _,F=0  .

Using these relations, the expressions for the boundary supercharges () and anticommutation relations for the asymptotic boundary degrees of freedom (), it is straightforward to derive the relations

Q  _^2=2MN  and Q  _+,Q  _-=4(H -E^bound (-1)^2F )  where  E^boundary M k^2   . 
Here it is interesting to notice that the term associated with the boundary energy is nothing but the boundary energy of the non-dynamical boundary SG model(Whereas we checked explicitly that it doesn't coincide with the boundary free energy calculated for general values of the coupling, i.e. in case of boundary degrees of freedom of the form ().)  at special point , given by (see for details)

E_boundary ^ = -M 2(/2) [(/)+(/)-1 2 (/2)+1 2 (/2)-1 2 ]  

together with ().
Consequently, both terms are positive definite for any value of the parameter  and any boundary ground state, as required. As an example, we can consider the massless limit    with  finite. In this case, the expectation value in the second term of () 
takes its minimal value, independantly of .
Notice that this subalgebra is different from the one given in. Although the second anticommutator is identical, the first differs by boundary contributions. Indeed, in a term proportional to the operator  arises in the r.h.s. of the first anticommutator. In other words (appart from the massless case), in order to avoid negative (or complex) expectation values 
of    Bogolmolnyi bounds are required in for the boundary parameters  . It is however not the case here. 

Comments about the boundary  supersymmetric sine-Gordon 
In the bulk, the boundary  supersymmetric sine-Gordon model possesses local (nonlocal) conserved charges which commute with each other. Together, they generate the quantum affine algebra . It follows that the soliton -matrix has the factorized form:

S^N=2 _SG ()=S_SG,^2 ()S_SG,q^2=-1 ()

where the bosonic part  is the sine-Gordon scattering matrix. From the tensor product structure, in the boundary case the boundary reflection matrix also takes a factorized form:

R^N=2 _SG ()=R_SG,^2 ()R_susy  () .
In, an action for the  supersymmetric sine-Gordon model has been proposed. It is exact in case of massless bulk and an approximation to first order in the bulk mass. At the boundary, this action contains fermionic boundary degrees of freedom coupled with the fermionic and bosonic fields . Starting from this Lagrangean, we checked explicitly  that the boundary supercharges take a form  similar to () with () and ().  They are different from the ones proposed in, which do not contain fermionic boundary degrees of freedom in front of the term associated with the topological charge.
Higher order corrections in the bulk mass term, if needed, would lead to the same form. Consequently, an exact action for the  supersymmetric boundary sine-Gordon model would lead to conserved boundary supercharges of the form () generating the  massive boundary superalgebra (), instead of the ones proposed in. Using previous analysis, it follows that the supersymmetric part  of the reflection matrix () is given by ().

Let us now turn to the bosonic part. Actually, there are two kinds of Lagrangean that can be constructed. On one hand, with a boundary interaction of the form which only contains fermionic boundary degrees of freedom (here denoted ). In this case, the pure bosonic boundary reflection scattering matrix  contains two free parameters and follows from the one proposed by Ghoshal-Zamolodchikov. On the other hand, it is well expected that a boundary interaction including bosonic  (denoted ) and fermionic boundary degrees of freedom can be constructed as well.  In such case, the bosonic
boundary reflection matrix follows from the results of, i.e. it reads

R_SG,^2 ()=K_0()Y()

where  ensures boundary unitarity and boundary cross-unitarity symmetry. Its "minimal" part  takes the same form as in () with entries 


&&A()=(q^-1 e^/^2 (p )-qe^-/^2 (q ))(q-q^-1 )/2c ,

&&E()=(q^-1 e^/^2 (q )-qe^-/^2 (p ))(q-q^-1 )/2c ,

&&B()=(-c^2q^-1 e^2/^2 -c^2qe^-2/^2 +q-q^-1  q+q^-1  (q^-1 (q )(p )
 - q(p )(q )))/2c^2 ,

&&D()=(-c^2q^-1 e^2/^2 -c^2q
e^-2/^2 +q-q^-1  q+q^-1  (-q(q )(p )
 + q^-1 (p )(q )))/2c^2 .
Here, the deformation parameter 
 and . 
Depending on the sign in (), the boundary quantization condition is fixed to

[p ,q ]=-2i ^2  mod (2i ) .

In total, the boundary reflection matrix () of each model contains  four or two boundary parameters, respectively. Probably there exists some relation between them, following the analysis of pole structure in. 
Details as well as further study of the second model will be considered elsewhere. 

To conclude, notice that considering the analytic continuation  would provide  the factorized scattering theory for the (second)  supersymmetric boundary sinh-Gordon model. In this case, up to the sign, the boundary quantization condition for boundary bosonic degrees of freedom becomes . Due to the recent conjecture about the dual representation of  supersymmetric Liouville field theory, it is worth interesting to understand weither a dual boundary action with   can be explicitly constructed. 

Relations with quantum impurity problems 
Several quantum impurity problems can be analysed using analytical
methods. For strongly interacting systems, nonperturbative ones are
crucial in order to study bosonized versions of gapless (critical)
quantum systems (for a review, see for instance). Among
the boundary quantum field theories that can describe such systems, the boundary massless SG model has been proposed and some exact results obtained from its nonperturbative analysis. Also, massive theories have applications in 1D impurity systems with an excitation gap. Let's see how our model provides exact results for such systems.

 The boundary scaling Lee-Yang model 

The scaling limit of the Ising model with a purely (bulk) imaginary magnetic field is described by the Lee-Yang model. Its UV limit leads to the non-unitary  minimal conformal field theory (with central charge ) which possesses only one primary field with conformal dimension . The bulk perturbation is identified with this field. In the IR limit, there is only one specie of particles associated with the Faddeev-Zamolodchikov creation operator "" whose scattering is described by the bulk -matrix
A (_1)A (_2)=S(_1-_2)A (_2)A (_1)with S()=-(1/3)(2/3)
and where we used the notations of the previous sections. In particular, the Lee-Yang model can be thought as the SG model at coupling constant  . Then , the bulk -matrix  factor () can be obtained from the first SG breather calculated in after projecting out the soliton sector. 


On the half-line, there is a single relevant boundary perturbation of the BCFT with certain conformal boundary conditions. The scattering of the fundamental particle on the boundary (with creation operator ) is described by the reflection factor  which satisfies

R()R(-)=1  ,R(i/2-)= S(2)R(i/2+)  ,and  R()= S(2)R(+i/3)R(.
Without degrees of freedom at the boundary, the boundary scaling Lee-Yang model has been studied in details  in from both analytical and numerical approach. In case of boundary degrees of freedom, it is thus natural to expect some changes in the scattering data. Taking   in the model (), it is not difficult to show that the corresponding minimal part of the soliton/antisoliton reflection matrix can be written in terms of () with () as(This solution is obvious as the boundary Yang-Baxter equations are invariant under the simultaneous change of sign in front of  and .) 

K()_susy   (3)_3where _3=diag(1,-1) .

For    there is only one breather  . Using the boundary  bootstrap equation, it is straightforward to obtain the first breather reflection amplitude

R_B ^(1) ()=- R_0^(1) (u)
S^(1) (0,u)S^(1) (/2,u)S^(1) (,u)
S^(1) (i,u)_
where
R_0^(n) (u)=(1 2 )(1+n 2 ) 
(3 2 +n 2 ) _l=1 ^n-1 (l 2 )(1+l 2 ) 
(3 2 +l 2 )^2 and 
S^(n) (x,u)=_l=0 ^n-1 (x  -1 2 +n-2l-1 2 ) 
(x  +1 2 +n-2l-1 2 )   
with the shorthand notation  
. However,  in order to be a solution of () it is necessary to restrict the values of the boundary parameters to  ,  . The final result for the reflection factor reads

R() = (3 6 )^-1 (5 6 )^-1 (4 6 )^-1  
(1+b 6 )(1-b 6 )^-1 (5+b 6 )^-1 (5-b 6 ) .

Following the notations of, for    and    one recovers the minimal solutions  ,   and    of  (), respectively. In particular, in the boundary condition    was identified with the reflection factor  . In case of fermionic boundary degrees of freedom added, together with  

R(i/2-)=S(S(+i(b-2)/6) R(i/2+)   
 we conclude that the fixed point  of the symmetry transformation () is associated with the conformal boundary condition  . Without fermionic boundary degrees of freedom, it was not the case in. This phenomena clearly needs further investigation which however goes beyond the scope of this paper.
 
 
  The anisotropic Kondo model and its massive extension 

 In two integrable massive versions of the anisotropic spin  Kondo model have been proposed at the reflectionless points. For general values of the coupling , the model () is an other one, although boundary degrees of freedom do not belong anymore to . From the results of the previous section,  we can now consider the Hamiltonian 
 
 H_MK =1 4g _- ^0 dx (((x))^2
 +(_x(x))^2 +8g(2(x))) - _B
 (S_+e^i(0)  + S_-e^-i(0) )  for g=2 2n+3   
where  and  are Pauli matrices. In the limit , it corresponds to the usual anisotropic (at zero voltage) Kondo model. Taking  and  in (), the transformation  with 
leaves the Hamiltonian invariant. Then, the corresponding soliton/antisoliton reflection matrix follows from () setting  and  in (), i.e. it reads

R ^(n) ()=K_susy  ((2n+1))_(,u)(i,u) 
()() ]_.

Notice that the massive deformation for  
in () preserves the known  supersymmetry of the massless Kondo model at that point. Breathers boundary reflection amplitudes  are calculated directly and given by

R_B ^(n) ()=(-1)^n R_0^(n) (u)
S^(n) (0,u)S^(n) (/2,u)S^(n) (,u)
S^(n) (i,u)_
together with (). It shows that the massive extension proposed
in is also  integrable at the special points .
If one considers a non-zero voltage, an interesting question would be to check weither the duality  still exists at these points in the massive case, or not.



 The boundary critical Ashkin-Teller model 

In two dimensions, the Ashkin-Teller model corresponds to two 
Ising models coupled by a local four spin interaction. The action associated with the critical line of the Ashkin-Teller
() model in the bulk corresponds to a conformal field theory with central
charge  (a free massless scalar field ). This critical
line can be parametrized by the conformal dimension
   of the thermal operator  
. Then, its -perturbation
 coincides with the 
sine-Gordon model. The order
 parameters are the fields ,  and the field
  with conformal dimensions 
 (independently of ) and  ,
 respectively. The field  which is local with respect to
  can be realized in terms of . At the special point , the Ashkin-Teller model enjoys  supersymmetry. 
 
For generic values of the coupling , a natural boundary version of the Ashkin-Teller model can be associated with action () and (), i.e. it has no free (boundary) parameters. At the special points , it admits a two-parameter family of boundary Lagrangean
representation of the form

A _bAT =_- ^ dy_- ^0 dx
(1 8 (_)^2-2 (x,y))
+ _- ^ dy (_0  b (y) +  _0 
b ^(y)) (y)  +  A _boundary  
where  is a complex parameter  and
the boundary dynamics are  described by

A _boundary =i_- ^ b ^d dy 
b  
dy .

The factorized scattering theory associated with these two phases follows from the results of and those presented here. In particular, for  this model exhibits  boundary supersymmetry defined in section 2.
