ABSTRACT 
 
For a quantum mechanical system with broken supersymmetry, it is
demonstrated that reformulation of the problem as that of a
-D Dirac equation allows an easy determination of the
ground state if the corresponding energy eigenvalue is
sufficiently small. A simple expression is derived for the
approximate ground state energy in an associated, well-separated,
asymmetric double-well-type potential. Our discussion is also
relevant for the analysis of the fermion bound state in the
kink-antikink scalar background.

Supersymmetry(SUSY) and its breaking are fundamental issues in
theoretical particle physics. There have also been numerous
applications of SUSY to quantum-mechanical potential problems
, based on the observation that the spectrum of
the Hamiltonian

H_+ = -d^2 dx^2  + V_+ (x) ,     V_+ (x)=W^2 (x) +
W'(x)  
( is the superpotential, and we set ) is
related through SUSY to that of the partner Hamiltonian

H_- = -d^2 dx^2  + V_- (x) ,     V_- (x)=W^2 (x) -
W'(x) . 
This formalism has provided us with a number of exactly solvable
quantum mechanical systems for which energy eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions can be found in closed forms. The key properties
that made such feat possible are unbroken SUSY, manifested by the
vanishing energy for the ground state of  (or ), and
shape invariance under the change of parameters for the given
potentials-. This approach can sometimes be
extended to parameter ranges corresponding to (spontaneously)
broken SUSY, and authors of Refs. have found
several additional exactly solvable systems by such consideration.
But, with SUSY broken, the ground state energy is no longer equal
to zero and this jeopardizes the possibility of obtaining exact
analytic results by the SUSY-based method in a crucial way.

In this work we will show that, in some broken SUSY case for which
the lowest energy  for the Hamiltonian  or 
is sufficiently small, reformulating the system into that for a
Dirac Hamiltonian (defined on a line) makes possible an easy
evaluation of . The conspicuous role assumed by the Dirac
operator as regards the zero eigenmodes is well-known,
and we here extend this role to the case of almost-zero-energy eigenmodes  in a restricted sense at least. Our
method finds useful application in studying the almost-zero-energy
fermion modes in the background of a soliton-antisoliton pair.

The superpotential relevant for our discussion is given as
follows. Let  be a generic function with the
properties

   _R (x)>0     &,  for  x>0 and  x not  very  small  , 
  _R (x)
-v     &,  for  x<0 and  x not  very  small   
and  the one with the properties

   _L (x)>0     &,  for  x<0 and  x not  very  small  , 
  _L (x)
-v     &,  for  x>0 and  x not  very  small   
so that the related potentials 
 and 
 may have the general shapes shown in Figs.1 and 2,
respectively. [Note that for any Hamiltonian having  or
 as its entire potential, we have a ground state of
strictly zero energy]. Then the superpotential appropriate to our
case is obtained by combining these two types of functions as

sp  W(x)=_R (x-l_1)+_L (x-l_2) +v 
with  taken to be reasonably large (so that
 may have a flat  basin between the points  and
).(At the later stage of our discussion we will
use the fact if  denotes a certain point in the flat basin,
the approximation  for  or
 for  is valid.)  See Fig.3 for
the schematic plots of  and the related potentials 
. Both  and 
being positive, this corresponds to the case of broken SUSY
; but, for the posited superpotential (with 
large), the ground state energy  is expected to be rather
small. [Our superpotential will be an even function of  if
 happens to be the mirror image of ,
i.e., , and  are equal to
].

For  specified as above, the corresponding Hamiltonians
 involve the potentials which can approximately be
described by the sum of two well-separated potentials (aside from
a constant term), i.e.,

 V_ (x) V_R (x-l_1) + V_L (x-l_2) -
v^2  .
These correspond to asymmetric double wells (even when  is
an even function) and hence the instanton method for instance
would not be useful.(See also Ref. for
previous applications of the (unbroken) SUSY in treating certain
double-well-type potentials.)  In principle, one can study the
energy eigenstates of this system by using perturbation theory
that takes full energy eigenstates of the two local Hamiltonian
(involving the potentials ,  separately) as
inputs. But, beyond the level of the tight-binding
approximation which may be applied with respect to degenerate
states of the local Hamiltonians, it is not a simple matter to use
this kind of perturbation theory since one needs to perform a
complicated state sum in general. Moreover, as for the ground
state of our Hamiltonian with the potential 
 (or ), the
tight-binding approximation is plainly not available - while the
local Hamiltonian involving  (or ) allows a
zero-energy bound state, no zero-energy state exists for the local
Hamiltonian involving  (or ). But the situation
changes if the problem is reformulated using the first-order Dirac
operator, and for the system under consideration we obtain,
through the analysis of the latter, the remarkably simple formula
for the lowest eigenvalue . It is simply the square 
of the product of the two zero-energy eigenfunctions (allowed with
the potentials  and 
separately)(This may be contrasted with the case of a
symmetric double well for which the ground state energy splitting
can approximately be given by a formula involving a single factor
of the state (or wave function) overlap term. For an
asymmetric double well, however, having two  factors of the
state overlap term is natural.) , evaluated at an
arbitrary chosen point  in the flat middle region of the
superpotential . See the expression () below.

The -D Dirac equation in an external scalar field 
reads

i^0 _t + i ^1 _x -W(x)
(x,t)=0  ,
where the -matrices may be chosen as 
 and 
. Here
we have a first order Hamiltonian

H_D -^0 ^1 _x + ^0
W(x) =  
with

A= _x + W(x)   ,   A^= -_x +W(x) ,
and the corresponding eigenvalue equation, 
 with 
, reduces to a pair of differential equations

  d1  A _1 (x)= _2 (x) , 

d2  A^ _2 (x)= _1 (x) .

An immediate consequence of these is that the functions
 here are eigenfunctions (with energy
) of the Schrodinger Hamiltonians we started with
, i.e.,

  H_- _1 (x)= ^2 _1 (x) , 

H_+ _2 (x)= ^2 _2 (x) ,
since

A^A = -^2_x + W^2 (x) -W'(x)H_-    ,   
AA^= -^2_x + W^2 (x) +W'(x)H_+  .The above observation may be used to establish the precise
connection between the bound-state eigenfunctions of  and
those of the Dirac Hamiltonian . Here it is not difficult to
show that
 
[(i)] if 
 is an eigenspinor of  with eigenvalue
, 
 corresponds to an eigenspinor of  with
eigenvalue , and

[(ii)] if  represents
a real, normalized, eigenfunction of  with energy 
, we have in 
 a real, normalized, eigenfunction of
 with the same energy.

Also, bound states of a one-dimensional Schrodinger Hamiltonian
are always nondegenerate. Hence, if 
() is a real, normalized, eigenfunction of 
() with energy , we conclude that either the
relation  or
 holds and the
normalized (real) eigenspinor of  with eigenvalue 
or  can be identified with

13  (x)=1 2        or      1 2 
  .
Moreover, if  happens to be an even function (and hence 
), one can immediately identify  with
; in this case, the eigenfunctions of  may
be found by solving the single equation

A_1(x)= _1(-x) .

We will now turn to the case with the superpotential (scalar
field) given by the form () with  large. Let
 denote the ground state of the Hamiltonian 
with a small energy , and 
 that of its isospectral partner  (with the same energy
eigenvalue). With the Dirac equation in Eqs. () and
(), the very fact that  becomes tiny as
 makes the related eigenspinor be amenable to
a simple perturbative analysis, regarding the terms on the right
(i.e., the pieces proportional to ) as small
perturbation.(But this is of different nature from the
usual Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbation theory in that we have
no small perturbing potential - what is small in our case is the
energy eigenvalue itself.)  This almost-zero-energy eigenmode of
the Dirac Hamiltonian with the eigenvalue  is
still given by the form (). In particular, the
corresponding zeroth-order expression (i.e., the expression for
infinite ), 

, can be written down using the appropriate wave
functions of the relevant Schrodinger Hamiltonian: in view of
Eq.() and considering the general shapes of the
potentials  shown in Fig.3, 
() can be taken as the normalized zero-energy
eigenfunction of  (
). According to this,  and
 will have to satisfy the first order differential
equations

15  [_x +
_R(x-l_1)]^0_1(x)=0     ,      [-_x +
_L(x-l_2)]^0_2(x)=0 ,
and hence acquire the explicit expressions

 ^0_1(x)= C_1 e^-^x_l_1  _R (y-
l_1)dy      ,     ^0_2(x)= C_2 e^^x_l_2  _L (y-
l_2)dy  
with appropriate (positive) normalization constants  and
.

In what follows, we will derive the following simple formula for
the very small eigenvalue of the Dirac Hamiltonian (in the leading
approximation):

  &=
^0_1(l^*)^0_2(l^*)

 &= C_1 C_2 e^-^l^* _l_1  _R (y-l_1)dy +
^l^* _l_2  _L (y-l_2)dy  , 
where  can be any point in the flat middle region of the
superpotential (see Fig.3). [Note that we do not have to be more
specific on the value of , the expression in Eq. ()
being independent of such choice]. Then, from 
, the lowest eigenvalue of the Schrodinger
Hamiltonian  may immediately be identified with

18 E=[^0_1(l^*)^0_2(l^*)]^2  .
As one recalls that the potential in our case has the structure
given in Eq.(), this formula has a somewhat surprising
appearance: while one of the wave function entering the formula
() is that of the zero-energy state allowed in one of the
local potential actually present, the other corresponds to the
zero-energy state allowed in the superpartner  of the
remaining local potential (or, one might say, the zero-energy
state allowed in the 'ghost' potential related to the actual local
potential by supersymmetry). The approximate ground state wave
functions will also be found below.

Note that the functions  and , as
solutions of Eqs. () and () with 
, may be written as

  19a _1 (x) = e^-^x _l_1  W(y)dy 
D_1 + ^x __1  dy
[e^^y_l_1  W(z)dz  _2(y)]   , 

19b  _2(x)=e^^x _l_2  W(y)dy  D_2 -
^x __2  dy [e^-^y_l_2  W(z)dz 
_1(y)]  ,

where , ,  and  are suitable
constants. Our wave functions  and 
should reduce for large  to  and
, respectively, and then, for large but finite 
(and hence small ), we may use Eqs. () and
() to express them by

  20a _1 (x) e^-^x _l_1  W(y)dy 
C_1 + ^x _l^*  dy
[e^^y_l_1  W(z)dz  _2^0(y)]   , 

20b  _2(x) e^^x _l_2  W(y)dy 
C_2 - ^x _l^*  dy [e^-^y_l_2 
W(z)dz  _1^0(y)]  

with the value  chosen conveniently at some point in the flat
middle region of the superpotential so that both  and
 may become . But the expression
() as  (and similarly that in Eq.
() as ) would blow up unless the
value of  were chosen such that

C_1 + ^- _l^* 
dy[e^_l_1 ^y W(z)dz  _2^0 (y) ] = 0  .
Then, with the explicit expression for  and 
given in Eqs. () and (), we observe that

  e^^y_l_1  W(z)dz  & e^^l^* _l_1  _R (z-l_1)dz  e^^l_2 _l^* 
_L (z-l_2)dz  e^^y _l_2  _L (z-l_2)dz  

&= C_1 [^0_1(l^*)^0_2(l^*)]^-1 
^0_2(y)  ,   (for  y[-,l^*]) ,
^- _l^* dy[^0_2(y)]^2 -^ _- dy[^0_2(y)]^2
=-1 ,                     
and hence the 'eigenvalue condition' () reduces to the
form

C_1 -C_1 [^0_1(l^*)^0_2(l^*)]^-1 
=0 .
This is our equation (), and the same follows from the
consideration based on Eq. (). With the eigenvalue
 determined in this manner, the corresponding wave
functions  and  (up to
normalization) are now expressed as

25  _1(x) 
_1^0(x) 1+ ^x _l^* dy
[^0_1(y)]^-1 ^0_2(y) ,& x>l^* 

[^0_2(x)]^-1 
^x _- dy[^0_2(y)]^2 ,& x<l^*    
_2(x)  
[^0_1(x)]^-1 ^ _x dy[^0_1(x)]^2 ,&x>l^*

^0_2(x)1+^l^* _x
dy[^0_2(y)]^-1  ^0_1(y)
 ,&x<l^* .

We expect that a judicious use of the tight-binding approximation
with the Dirac Hamiltonian  (), taking
 and
 as the
degenerate (i.e., zero energy) eigenstates of the corresponding
local Hamiltonians, lead to the same conclusion as
above.(But, since the Dirac Hamiltonian is unbounded from
below, some care must be exercised.)  This is supported by the
observation that, for the eigenvalue , the same result
(i.e., Eq. ()) follows from the calculation based on the
formula

= ^ _- dx
^0_(x) H_D ^0_(x) = ^ _- dx [_R(x-l_1) +v]_1^0(x)
^0_2(x) ,
where 

 is the zeroth-order state
mentioned above. Indeed,

split ^ _- dx [_R(x-l_1)
+v]_1^0(x) ^0_2(x) &^ _l^* dx
[_R(x-l_1) +v]_1^0(x) ^0_2(x) 
 &^0_2(l^*)^ _l^* dx [_R(x-l_1)
+v]_1^0(x)e^-v(x-l^*) 
&=-^0_2(l^*)^ _l^* dx
d dx [^0_1(x)e^-v(x-l^*) ]
&=^0_1(l^*)
^0_2(l^*) , 
since, for ,  may well be replaced by
.

As an explicit example, consider the superpotential of the form

W(x)=v  sgn (x-L 2 ) - v  sgn (x+L 2 )
+v ,
i.e., in our notation, ,
, and
. Given this, the
potentials of the Schrodinger Hamiltonians  will be (see
Fig.4)

V_(x)=v^2 2v (x-L 2 ) 2v  (x+L 2 ) .
For these systems, one can of course find the exact ground state
energy  by solving the appropriate Schrodinger
equations. This exercise shows that  is the root of the
equation , and hence, for
large , we have

E v^2 e^-2vL  .
Let us see whether our formula () yields the same. The
normalized solutions of Eq. () are trivially found here:

^0_1(x)=v  e^-vx-L 2       ,     
^0_2(x)=v  e^-vx+L 2   .
Then, from Eq. (), we have that  (for large )
should equal .
Hence a complete agreement.

More physically relevant example is provided by the scalar field
(superpotential) appropriate to the kink-antikink pair,

W(x)= v[ 2 
(x-L 2 )] - v[ 2 
(x+L 2 )] +v .
Here the scalar field 
 represents a kink
located at , and 
 an antikink at
. The widely-separated kink-antikink
configuration, described by the form (), has received
attention in Refs.. Especially interesting
is the almost zero-energy mode of the Dirac Hamiltonian
(), in connection with the role of the so-called
Jackiw-Rebbi mode (which refers to the zero-energy
fermion mode in the kink or antikink background) when
a kink and an antikink are simultaneously present. In the kink or
antikink background the Jackiw-Rebbi mode is represented by

 or 
, if  and  denote
the normalized solutions of Eq. ():

^0_1(x)=C[ 2 (x-L 2 )]^-2v   
     ,     
^0_2(x)=C[ 2 (x+L 2 )]^-2v   
 ,
where 

.
Then, in the above kink-antikink scalar background, one can
immediately find the energy of the almost-zero-energy fermion
eigenmode by using our formula () - it is equal to 
, with(Based on some heuristic arguments the
author of Ref. also identified  with the
expectation value in Eq. (). But his final expression for
 is apparently not consistent with our result in Eq.
()-this is due to the calculational error made in
Ref. (e.g., wrong fermion zero-energy wave functions
used).) 

  &=
^0_1(0)^0_2(0)=
C^2[L 4 ]^-4v    

& 2 e^4v   
(2v  +1 2 ) 
(2v  )(1 2 )  e^-vL  .

[Note that, in the limit , this yields the
value , which is equal to the square
root of the result in Eq. ()]. The exponential dependence
of  on the distance  was previously noted in
Ref.. This -dependent fermion energy shift will
contribute to the effective potential between the kink and the
antikink. For instance, in the vacuum sector where all negative
energy fermion modes are to be occupied, the contribution from
this mode, i.e., that with energy  will become more
negative as  decreases, thus producing an attractive
interaction between the kink and the antikink (if only this mode
is taken into account). The related fermion eigenfunctions with
energy  can also be obtained with the help of the
formulas (), () and ().

In this work we investigated on some special properties pertaining
to the ground state of a quantum mechanical Hamiltonian with
broken supersymmetry, when the corresponding eigenvalue is small.
We showed that the reformulation of the system using a
one-dimensional Dirac Hamiltonian greatly facilitates the
analysis, providing a very simple (approximate) expression for the
ground state energy. Our formula () should be useful in
finding the ground state energy of a Schrodinger Hamiltonian the
potential in which can be approximated by the form ().
Actually, for the validity of this formula, the separation
distance between the local potentials may not have to be very
large, for we believe that a good measure on the validity is
really the smallness of the state overlap (i.e., of the term
 in Eq. ()). It would be
highly desirable if an analogous approach can be developed for
systems defined in more than one spatial dimensions (for instance
to study the role of Jackiw-Rebbi-type fermion modes in the
background of more general soliton-antisoliton pair configurations
). This is left for future study.
