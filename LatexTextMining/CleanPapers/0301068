Abstract 



 

We present a simple group representation analysis of massive, and 
particularly "partially massless", fields of arbitrary 
spin in de Sitter spaces 
of any dimension. 
The method uses bulk to boundary propagators to relate 
these fields to Euclidean conformal ones at one dimension lower.
These results are then used to revisit an old question:
can a consistent de Sitter supergravity be 
constructed, at least within its intrinsic horizon?














Introduction 

In addition to (perhaps) being our macroscopic habitat , 
the conformally flat, constant curvature, de Sitter (dS) 
space has 
long been a 
seminal laboratory for field theory in curved backgrounds, being the 
simplest possible generalization of the Minkowski vacuum.
Indeed, dS effects on a spin 1/2 field's 
propagation were first studied seven decades ago .
Ever since, systems 
of all spins and masses have been analyzed in both dS and anti de Sitter
(AdS), with obvious connections to string expansions(A
detailed analysis of partially massless representations has 
previously been given
by solving the Laplace equation on spheres for higher spin harmonics
and then analytically continuing these solutions to dS
space . Although this analysis has the advantage 
of applying to the entire dS space, it is rather complicated
and the simple interpretation of partially massless fields in terms
of missing lower helicity states is obscured.) .
A particularly striking effect, that of partial masslessness or partial gauge 
invariance, arising first at spin 2 , 
was recently discussed by us in some 
detail . 
(see also ).
The purpose of the present work is 
twofold :  First, we formalize the kinematics underlying these 
properties in a group theoretic context, using a dS/CFT
correspondence between  
and Euclidean space . This will 
exhibit the details of partial masslessness for all spin, in all 
dimensions , as 
well as the ensuing propagation properties at these 
thresholds(Note that
the partial masslessness phenomenon occurs in AdS as well. In that
case, however, only strictly massless representations are unitary. The
representation theory of these fields is much easier to understand,
since the algebra can be graded with respect to the generator
of the  factor of the maximal compact subgroup of the
AdS isometry group. Partially massless
representations are obtained by searching for null descendants. We
thank M. Vassiliev for pointing this out to us.) .  Secondly, we will use the 
above systematics to reassess the case for (and against) extending models of 
cosmological supergravity from their natural AdS arena to dS.  Before 
proceeding to details, we immediately disclaim any global ambitions for dS:  
we will be working primarily on one patch of the full dS, and 
there only within its intrinsic event horizon, this being the lamppost under 
which the physics is (relatively) clear.

In Section , 
we review the description of dS as a coset and the corresponding 
algebra as that of the Euclidean conformal group in one lower
dimension.  
Section  
illustrates our method in the simplest case of scalar fields.  We will 
relate fields in  
with conformal ones on  by using an intertwiner, 
essentially establishing a (dS/CFT) correspondence in terms of a proper time 
propagator.  In Section , 
we generalize to bosons of arbitrary spin.  We next 
apply the above results to partially massless higher spin bosons, where 
discrete ratios of (mass) to cosmological constant imply light cone 
propagation and (partial) gauge invariances.  In
Section  we treat fermions in  
the a priori  hostile dS context.  Finally, in Section , we
revisit the old  
question of the extent, if any, to which a dS supergravity can be viable, 
presenting the pros and cons in terms of our framework.  


de Sitter Space 


The dS spacetime is the coset 
and is geometrically described by 
the one sheeted hyperboloid(Our index conventions
are , raised and lowered by the Minkowski metric of the
 dimensional embedding space 
;   
 (also denoted by vectors),
covariant with respect to the  subgroup generated by , raised
and lowered by the Kronecker delta. 
) 
Z^MZ_M=-(Z^0)^2+_i=1 ^n(Z^i)^2+(Z^n+1 )^2=1 ,

embedded in . The cosmological constant
 
is positive in dS space and usually enters the
equation hyperboloid  
as  on the right hand side. We will work in units  
throughout, 
however. 


The dS group 
acts naturally on  with generators
M_MN =i(Z_M_N-Z_N_M)
obeying the Lie algebra
[M_MN ,M_RS ]=i_NR M_MS -i_NS M_MR 
+i_MS M_NR -i_MR M_NS  .
We will employ a coordinate system 
in which spatial sections are flat and therefore rewrite this algebra
in terms of
P_iM_i0 +M_n+1 ,i  ,DM_n+1 ,0  ,K_iM_i0 -M_n+1 ,i  ,
and  so that
&[P_i,P_j]=0 ,[K_i,K_j]=0 ,&
 

& [D,P_i]=iP_i ,[D,M_ij ]=0 ,[D,K_i]=-iK_i ,&
 

& [M_ij ,P_k]=i(P_i_jk -P_j_ik ) , [M_ij ,K_k]=i(K_i_jk -K_j_ik ) ,&


& [P_i,K_j]=-2i_ij D+2iM_ij  .&The generators 
 satisfy the  angular momentum Lie algebra, so identifying 
the remaining generators  as momenta,  as dilations
and  as conformal boosts, we see that the algebra lie  generates
the Euclidean conformal group in  dimensions.
To make the relation between the coset  and
hyperboloid hyperboloid 
explicit, we begin by introducing the
matrix representation of the generators gens0 
P_i=i
(
 
) ,
D=i
(
 
) ,
K_i=i
(
 
) .
[All entries of the  dimensional vector  
vanish save for the  slot which is unity.]
Now choose a standard vector . Since this is the
defining representation of , the vector 
satisfies the hyperboloid condition hyperboloid  for any 
 and in fact the entire dS space can be obtained this
way. The stabilizer of  is the subgroup ,
therefore .


Parameterizing coset elements as
g=(-iPx)(iDt)
=(
 
)
(
 
)
,
we find the embedding coordinates to be 
Z^M=(gX)^M=
(
t+12 e^t x^2 ,  e^tx ,
  t - 12 e^t x^2
) .
The dS metric then follows:
ds^2=dZ^M _MN  dZ^M=-dt^2+e^2t dx^2
dx^g_ dx^ .
While the parameterization of the
coset param  only spans one half, , of the hyperboloid,
the physical region within the intrinsic horizon
0>-1+e^2t  x^2=^_ ,^,

is covered by this coordinate patch.

Representing Fields in de Sitter: Scalars 


We now use the simplest, scalar, fields in  to
illustrate the correspondence with conformal fields on 
based on an intertwiner for on-shell dS field representations(
See also  for a discussion of the AdS/CFT correspondence
in terms of free scalar field intertwiners.) .

A scalar field in a gravitational background is described by the action
S=12d^n+1 x-g  (D_D^-n-1 4n  R
-m^2) ,
and yields a conformally improved scalar at .
For the constant curvature dS background
with metric metric , the scalar curvature .
The action is then
invariant under the isometries of  (for any value of
the mass )
whose action on the
coordinates  may be deduced by examining 
the transformation of the
embedding coordinates  
in embed  generated by the matrices gens .
This yields symmetry transformations of  generated by
&iP_i =&_i ,

&iD =&-d dt +x ,

&iM_ij =&x_i_j -x_j_i ,

&iK_i =&
-2x_i(-d dt +x)+(-e^-2t +x^2)_i . We can also read off the  Killing vectors of
 from the Lie derivatives above. In particular
, where  is the timelike Killing
vector within the horizon. Observe that the horizon
condition horizon  is invariant under the action of .

The representation (-) acting on off-shell fields

is not reducible, as evidenced by the quadratic 
Casimir
C _2&&1 2 M_MN M^NM 

&=&D^2+1 2 (P_iK_i+K_iP_i)-1 2 M_ij M^ij 

&=&-d^2 dt^2 -nd dt +e^-2t ^2 .Incidentally, 
the quartic Casimir(For , the quartic Casimir
is just the square of a (five dimensional) "Pauli-Lubanski"
vector )  vanishes for the scalar
representation,
C _4-M_MN M^NO M_OP M^PM +2 C _2^  ^ss2  
-(n-2)(n-3) C _2=0 .
The operator  in c2  is precisely the Laplace-Beltrami
operator  on , so we obtain an irreducible
representation by solving the field
equation
(D_D^.
To this end, we expand  in spatial Fourier modes
(x)=d^nx  e^ikx   a(k,t)+c.c. 
, kk ,
and must now solve
(-d^2 dt^2 -nd dt -e^-2t 
k^2-14(n^2-1)-m^2) 
a(k,t)=0 .
This is Bessel's equation in the "conformal 
time"(The metric  
is then manifestly conformally Minkowskian.) 
variable  for the function . Hence we may
express  in terms of a Hankel function
a(k,t)=k^- e^-12nt  H_(-ke^-t )
a(k)f_k(t;) a(k) ,
with index
14-m^2  .
Since the Hankel function is just a plane wave (multiplied 
by a slowly varying time dependent amplitude) for index
, conformally improved scalars ()
propagate on the light cone.

On-shell scalar fields are labeled by the arbitrary function 
, so we now study the irreducible representation of the dS
group acting on these functions induced by the original representation
in terms of isometries of . In mathematical terms, we
want to study the intertwiner
(x)=d^n x  f_k(t;) e^ikx  a(k)+c.c. 
between the isometry representation on functions  and 
the irreducible representation on functions
.

The first step is the intertwining spatial fourier transform
which replaces  and 
 (maintaining the ordering). Denoting the resulting generators
obtained from P  to K  this way by tildes, we have the 
useful identities
iD  f_k(t;)=(n 2 ) f_k(t;) ,iK_i  f_k(t;)=0 .
Therefore we get a very simple action on functions 
(dropping the irksome tildes)
iP_i&=&ik_i ,

iD&=&-k k +n 2  ,

iM_ij &=&k_i k^j -k_j k^i  ,

iK_i&=&2i(k k +n 2 -)
 k^i 
-ik_i  k  k  .
Performing an inverse spatial fourier transform, 
 and  intertwines to 
the usual representation of the Euclidean conformal group
acting on scalars in  dimensions
iP_i&=& y^i  ,

iD&=&y y + ,

iM_ij &=&y_i y^j -y_j y^i  ,

iK_i&=&-2y_i(y y +)
+y^2 y^i   .
This is precisely the action of the conformal group acting on 
scalars (quasi-primaries) of conformal weight 
n 2 +.
The intertwiner is given by
(x^)=d^nk  e^ikx  
f_k(t;)d^ny  e^-iky  (y)
+c.c. 
 .The field  is a quasi-primary of weight .
The  integral can be performed by employing the
integral representation of the Hankel function
k^- H_(uk)=-i   e^-12i  
_0^d ^+1   
[1 2  iu(+k^2 )] .
We find 
(x^)= d^ny (x-y,t) 
(y) .
Here
(x-y,t)=N 
_0^d ^n 2 +1  [-i 2u (-u^2+(x-y)^2)] .

is the Schwinger proper time parametrization of the bulk
to boundary propagator from
conformal time  to  (up to some overall
normalization . Therefore the
intertwiner intertwine  exactly realizes the dS/CFT correspondence
of .

We end this section by noting that the quadratic Casimir for the 
conformal representation conformal  is
C _2=-(,
which agrees with the one imposed by the field equation shell .
The quartic Casimir invariant vanishes also in the 
conformal representation, as it should for scalars.


Representing Arbitrary Spin Bosons 


A massive bosonic spin  field in dS space can be
described by a completely symmetric(We concentrate on 
 completely symmetric higher spin representations. 
See  
for a discussion of higher spins for other tensor symmetries.)

D.__2_s =^ __3_s  .
For generic values of the mass ,  describes the
(n,s)(n+2s-2)(n+s-3)! s!(n-2)! 
degrees of freedom of a spin  symmetric field in  dimensions. 
The mass parameter(For scalars, there is no
gauge invariance, but one often chooses  such that vanishing 
mass yields a conformally improved scalar in general backgrounds as we did
in Section . It is a peculiarity of four dimensions that
the choice of mass parameter required for gauge invariance of spins 
also yields the conformally improved scalar when continued to .)  
is defined so that the theory is strictly massless
for  with a gauge invariance(For example, the massive spin 1
field equation 
 obeys a Bianchi identity  at ,
as is easily verified using
 in dS.) 
__1_s =_(_1 __2_s)  ,
(subject
to ).
The degree of freedom count is then
(n,s)-(n,s-1)=(n+2s-3)(n+s-4)! s!(n-3)!  .
Actions may be written down
for these free theories, both massive and massless; 
see  for details.
The dS isometries act on off-shell fields 
as
iP_i __1_s &=&_i__1_s  ,

iD __1_s &=&(-d dt +x)
__1_s +s _(_1 ^j
__2_s)j  ,

iM_ij __1_s &=&(x_i_j-x_j_i)__1_s 
-s _i(_1 __s)j +
s _j(_1 __s)i  ,

iK_i__1_s &=&
[-2x_i(-d dt +x)+(-e^-2t +x^2)_i] __1_s 

&+&2s _i(_1 __2_s)0 
+2se^-2t  ^0_(_1 __2_s)i 
-2s _i(_1 __2_s)j x_j

&+&s x_j(_i(_1 __s)j -
_j(_1 __s)i ) .
It is tedious but not difficult 
to solve the field equations in the frame metric  and then
construct the higher spin bulk to boundary propagator
__1_s =d^ny (x-y,t)__1_s 
^i_1i_s  V_i_1i_s  .
The higher spin boundary fields  are totally symmetric and 
traceless in  dimensions and transform under the 
conformal algebra as
iP_i V_(s) &=&_i V_(s)  ,

iD_i V_(s) &=&(y^i _i+_s) V_(s)  ,

iM_ij V_(s) &=&(y_i _j-y_j_i)-S _ij  V_(s)  ,

iK_iV_(s) &=&(-2iy_iD+iy^2 P_i)V_(s) +y_jS _ij V_(s)  .
Here  is shorthand for 
and the intrinsic spin operator 
acts as
S_ij  V_i_1i_s =_
V_i_1i_+1 i_s _ji_ -
(ij)
 .
The weight  is computed by examining the quadratic Casimir
of this representation
C _2=-_s(_s-n)-s(s+n-2) .
For higher spins, the quadratic Casimir and Laplacian are no longer
equal; instead, a simple computation reveals that
D_D^__1_s =(C _2+s(s+n-1))
__1_s  . 
Comparing C2 ,  shift  and eoms  relates the
mass parameter  and weight ,
m^2=-_s(_s-n)+(s-2)(s-2+n) .Our next task is to find the values of  making fields
massless or partially massless.



Partially Massless Bosons 

We have assembled all the relevant machinery to provide a very
simple description of partially massless bosons in 
dS in terms of representations of the  dimensional
conformal group.

We recall that the physical polarizations of a 
strictly massless field satisfy 
.V_(s-1) ^i V_ii_2i_s =0 .
thanks to the gauge invariance gauge  which projects out
all but the maximal helicity  excitations(Helicity in
dimensions  can be defined in terms of 
. Strictly speaking, in the discussion above,
we should refer to the absolute value of the helicity.) . 
A field obeying strict  has the correct degree of freedom 
count, as given in countfreedom , for a strictly massless field.


For partially massless fields,  gauge invariances of the form
__1_s =_(_1_t 
__t+1 _s) +
imply that the requirement strict  is
relaxed and replaced by
^i_1 ^i_t  V_i_1i_s =0 , (ts).
We call such a field "partially massless of depth ".
This amounts to projecting out all helicities save 
and gives  degrees of freedom.



The subalgebra of translations, dilations and rotations 
leaves the condition partial  invariant. However, conformal
boosts do not, unless one tunes the conformal weights 
appropriately. To obtain these tunings we study
^i_1 ^i_t K_iV_i_1i_s =0 ,
for depth  partially massless polarizations 
 subject to partial .
It is a simple combinatorics problem to compute the (unique)
value of  as a function of the depth  such that 
the condition condition  holds. We state the result below.
The main idea is conveyed by the simplest non-trivial example, spin 2.

For a spin 2 field , the conformal boost
acts as
iK_iV_jk =i(-2y_iD+y^2 P_i)V_jk +4y_(j V_k)i 
-_i(j y_lV_k)l  .
The field  is strictly massless whenever
^iV_ij =0 , so we test whether this condition is respected by conformal
boosts by computing
^k K_iV_jk =2i(_s-n)V_ij  .
Here we have relied on the divergence constraint  div . 
Hence we find the strictly
massless tuning 
_s=n .Using this relation as well as  in mass  gives , the
correct tuning for a strictly massless spin 2 boson.

To study partially massless spin 2, we replace the single
divergence condition div  by the double divergence one
^ij V_ij =0.Now we must compute
^j ^k K_iV_jk &=&4i(_s-n+1)_jV_ij 
where we used divdiv  but not  div .
Therefore we obtain the partially massless spin 2 
tuning
_s=n-1 .It is also clear that the partially massless representation
is irreducible. One might have thought it to be a direct sum of
spin 2 and spin 1 strictly massless representations. However, since
the tunings stricttune  and partune  differ, 
the strictly massless spin 2 field components satisfying div 
mix with the remaining ones when .

We calculate the tunings for arbitrary spin in the same way
by imposing partial 
and computing
^i_1 ^i_t  K_i V_i_1i_s =
2it(_s-n-s+t+1) ^i_2 ^i_t  V_ii_2i_s  .
The tunings are therefore
_s=n+s-t-1 .Inserting the tuning condition loony_tunes  in
the dS mass-conformal weight relation mass 
yields the mass conditions for depth  partial masslessness
m^2=(t-1)(2s-3+n-t) .
Firstly note that for depth , i.e.  strictly massless
fields, the mass parameter . Also when , the result agrees
with the one conjectured in  on the basis of requiring
light cone propagation for partially massless fields. 

Fermion Representations 


There is no fundamental difficulty in adapting the above bosonic
manipulations to fermions, only tedium. 


Rather than performing
the computation we note that a massive spin 
fermionic field satisfies 
(/
D+m)__1_s =0=D.__2_s =
.__2_s  .
Here  is a completely symmetric tensor-spinor.
With the above choice of the parameter , strict masslessness occurs
at(Again, this criterion applies to masslessness imposed by a
gauge invariance and is valid for spins . In four dimensions,
coincidentally, it yields  for , the same value required for a
conformally improved spinor.)  

m^2=-(s+n2-2)^2 .

Accounting for this "offset", we find partially massless tunings
for fermions at
m^2=-(s-t+n2-1)^2 ,
in precise agreement with the result of  for .
Recalling that the cosmological constant is reinstated by
multiplying the right hand side of ftune  by , we note
(as observed in ), that fermionic tunings are satisfied for 
real values of  only for , i.e.  in AdS space.
The parameter , (not its square) appears in the action, for these
theories. For the choice of square root 
, the action 
for partially (and strictly) massless dS fermionic fields no longer 
obeys a reality condition, but is invariant under a formal gauge invariance.
This property is the root cause of the difficulty defining dS
supergravities, the topic of the next section.  

de Sitter Supergravity Revisited 
Our considerations thus far have led us to the following picture 
(illustrated in Figure ) of
particles in (A)dS backgrounds. Partially massless fields, of either 
statistics, are always unitary in dS, while in AdS only strictly massless ones 
are. From Figure , 
this behavior is understood by turning on cosmological 
constants of either sign and following their effects on the signs of lower 
helicity state norms. A sequence of unitary partially massless
fields is only encountered when starting from Minkowski space
() and first turning on a positive cosmological constant.
The bad news, 
however, is that partially massless
fermions require tunings with negative  as already noted in cosmological  
supergravity .   
This led to the rejection of (see especially ) 
dS supergravity   
as a consistent local QFT, a rejection bolstered later by the  difficulties   
in defining 
string theory on dS backgrounds (see for example ).

 
 

 Cosmological phase diagrams for partially
massless Bose and Fermi fields depicting strictly massless
and maximal depth partially massless tunings. All other lines
with partially massless gauge invariances appear between these. 


Let us first present the reasons for rejection in terms of the present 
analysis, followed by such mitigating circumstances as we can muster for 
keeping the possibility in play. For concreteness, we deal primarily here
with  supergravity in four dimensions.

 
Although (formally) locally supersymmetric actions exist, the mass
parameter appearing in the term 
 must be pure imaginary for 
lightcone propagation.
Therefore, the action of dS supergravity does not obey
a reality condition. 

The associated local supersymmetry
transformations ,
being complex, cannot
preserve Majorana
condition on fields. For  supersymmetry, a symplectic
reality condition is possible, but the locally supersymmetric action is
either still complex or the Maxwell field's kinetic term has
tachyonic sign .

Another way to see that there can be
no real supercharges is that the  dS superalgebra 
ought be the ,  superlorentz algebra, but
there are no Majorana spinors in  Minkowski space. 

Because dS has topology 
, gauge charges (being surface integrals) 
vanish since there are no spatial boundaries . 
This argument is of a different nature from the previous ones
as it involves the global considerations which we have chosen to ignore.

Finally, even for the  case, where a dS superalgebra
exists, there are no positive mass, unitary representations . 
Unlike the praiseworthy AdS algebra, our maximal compact subalgebra
has no  factor whose generator could define a positive mass
Hamiltonian. Again this is a global issue.

Let us now present the arguments in favor of dS supergravity:
 
While the tuned dS supergravity mass
m^2=-/3 .

is indeed negative, there 
are precedents for consistent theories with negative , for example
scalars in AdS for which a range of such values can be 
tolerated essentially because the lowest
eigenvalue of the Laplacian has a positive offset there.
Figure  shows that fermions mirror this behavior in dS.

Despite an imaginary
mass-like term in the action, at least the free field
representations are unitary. For unitarity of spin 3/2
representations, the
relevant quantity is , not  alone. In addition the
linearized equations of motion for physical spin 2, helicity  and
its proposed spin , helicity  superpartner degrees of freedom
are identical
Spin 2: (-u^2d^2 du^2 -ud du  
+u^2 ^2+3 4   
) _2 =0 ,
 
Spin 3/2: (-u^2d^2 du^2 -ud du  
+u^2 ^2+3 4   
) _3/2 =0 .
Here we have employed
the frame ; a detailed derivation
may be found in .


In dS space positivity of energy is possible only for
localized excitations within the horizon horizon . Only this
region of dS possesses a timelike Killing vector. dS
gravity is therefore stable against local excitations within the
physical region (The same conclusion applies
also to partially massless dS fields, see .) . 
Observations of supernovae
suggest that we inhabit an 
asymptotically dS universe . Although dS
quantum gravity is problematic, nobody would reject cosmological
Einstein gravity as an effective description of local physics
within the physical region. This looser criterion 
is all we should require of a
sensible dS supergravity.
As stated, any local supersymmetry is purely formal in the absence
of  Majorana spinors (even the fermionic field equation above 
is not consistent with a reality condition on ).
In any case, a bona fide  dS superalgebra with
Majorana super charge, would imply a global positive energy theorem from 
, which is already ruled out at the level of dS
gravity. Instead, we could envisage relaxing the Majorana
condition
and allowing only a formal local supersymmetry.
A direct Hamiltonian constraint analysis still
shows that only helicities 
propagate. Also there are other examples where the Majorana condition
must be dropped, but nonetheless a formal supersymmetry yields the
desired Ward identities: continuation to Euclidean space is a familiar
case 
.

The summary in favor of dS supergravity is then that 
the free field limit is unitary with
time evolution governed by the Hermitean generator 
subject to a positive energy condition-within the physical region
inside the Killing horizon. A formal supersymmetry, similar to 
that remaining when Euclideanizing supersymmetric Minkowski models,
suffices to show that amplitudes obey supersymmetric Ward identities.
  

Conclusions 

Our work has consisted of two parts, one unambiguously correct, 
the other more speculative, or better, open-ended.  The first, 
demonstrable, one was devoted to a simple formulation of generic spin massive 
models in arbitrary dimensional dS, one that was particularly relevant to 
hierarchies of partial massive higher spins.  Use of a dS/CFT correspondence 
between the fields and their (boundary) Euclidean limits in one lower 
dimension was an important ingredient in the process, and our conclusions 
established and generalized to arbitrary dimensions our original conjectures 
in this respect. In particular we have provided an explicit realization
of the suggestion of , that an AdS/CFT correspondence for 
partially massless fields should be considered in dS, rather than AdS
where these fields are not unitary. Of course the most pressing question
now is whether this new perspective yields any insight on the much harder
problem of interactions for partially massless fields.

Our second aim was to review the arguments, pro and con, concerning 
existence, albeit in a restrictive sense, of N=1 dS supergravity.  
The arguments against 
are well known, revolving about the need for an imaginary spin 3/2 mass 
parameter and correspondingly imaginary term in its action, all in addition 
to the generic problems inherited from the intrinsic horizon of dS.  But 
imaginarity in turn implies that the local SUSY is purely formal and the 
supercharges are not Hermitean.  The arguments in favor accept, but try to 
turn, these manifest difficulties into harmless ones.  Whatever their force, 
they do have on their side the fact that we may well be living inside the 
horizon of some asymptotically dS world, one in which supersymmetric physics 
should have a place.
