We investigate the fermionic sector of a given theory, in which massive and
charged Dirac fermions interact with an Abelian gauge field, including a
non standard contribution that violates both Lorentz and CPT symmetries.
We offer an explicit calculation in which the radiative corrections due to
the fermions seem to generate a Chern-Simons-like effective action. Our
results are obtained under the general guidance of dimensional regularization,
and they show that there is no room for Lorentz and CPT violation in both
commutative and noncommutative spacetime.

Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism was crucial to question
Galileu invariance, to give rise to Lorentz symmetry. Nowadays, in string
theory one may find a way to question Lorentz invariance, since there are
interactions that support spontaneous breaking of Lorentz symmetry.
In string theory, one may also find room for noncommutativity of the
coordinates that define the spacetime manifold. Thus, is appears
legitimate to investigate possible breaking of Lorentz invariance
in both commutative and noncommutative spacetime.

The issue of breaking Lorentz invariance has been recently addressed by
many authors. The standard route includes a modification
of Maxwell's theory, in which one adds the Chern-Simons-like term
.
The problem relies on recognizing that Lorentz and CPT symmetries are violated
in the fermionic sector of a given theory, which contains the contributions
faction 
I_f=d^4x (i//A -/b _5)The three first terms are usual; they describe charged
and massive Dirac fermions coupled to an Abelian gauge field. However,
the fourth term is unusual:  is a constant four vector which
selects a fixed direction in spacetime, and explicitly
violates Lorentz and CPT symmetries. The fermions can be integrated,
and the radiative result may lead to
cs 
I_CS =12d^4x^ _ 
F_ A_ 
with  being proportional to , that is
. This result, if correct,
introduces a modification of electrodynamics, which allows for the explicit
violation of Lorentz and CPT symmetries. The issue has been carefully
investigated in several different contexts, leading to results in which 
vanishes or not.

In the present work we revisit the problem, with the aim to extend the
calculation to the noncommutative spacetime manifold. The importance of
investigating noncommutativity of spacetime has been brought to high energy
physics via string theory - see also for other
informations. In our quest to deal with the issue in the standard
case, however, we had to introduce new calculations which led us to the result
that there is neither Lorentz nor CPT violation in the commutative spacetime.
And this was also shown to be correct in the noncommutative case. These results
were obtained under the general guidance of dimensional regularization, and
they have led us to offer our calculations in a form as standard as possible,
keeping track of the main steps and enlightening the way the puzzle shows up:
as we shall see, there is an intricate entanglement between the calculation
involving the Dirac matrices and the evaluation of the momentum integral
of all the contributions at first order in the vector that responds for
Lorentz and CPT violation, and at second and third (in the noncommutative
case) order in the gauge field. We implement our investigations using
derivative expansion of operators, and we consider
the spacetime as commutative and noncommutative.

Firstly we work in the commutative case. To account for the fermionic
integration we write
e^i I[b,A] =D D e^id^4xL _f 
where the effective action is given by
I[b,A]=-iTr (/p -m-/A -/b _5)
We use this expression to write: . The first
term is 
, which does not depend on the gauge field.
The second term is , which is given by
ea 
I^ [b,A]=iTr  _n=1 ^ 1n
[1/p -m-/b _5 /A ]^n
In this expression we single out the term
I^(2) [b,A]=i 2 Tr 1 /p-m-/b
_5 /A 1 /p-m-/b_5 /A 
which is the term that matter, in the quest to find how the radiative
corrections generate the Chern-Simons-like term written in Eq. ().

We can proceed following two distinct routes, in which one includes or not
the contribution involving the vector  into the Dirac
propagator - see Ref.   for details. In the present work we
follow the perturbative route, so we use the expression
exp 
1 /p-m-/b_5 =1 /p-m +1 
/p-m /b_5 1 /p-m +to write, to first order in  and second order in 
eat 
I^(1,2) [b,A]=i 2 Tr 
[S(p)/b_5 S(p)
/A S(p)/A +S(p)/A S(p)
/b_5 S(p)/A ]
where we have set
S(p)=1/p-m 
We rewrite Eq. () in the form
ea1 
I^(1,2) [b,A]=i 2 d^4x(_a^ +
_b^ )A_ A_ 
where
_a^ =tr d^4p (2)^4  S(p)/b 
_5S(p)^ S(p-i)^ 
and
_b^ =tr d^4p (2)^4  S(p)^ 
S(p-i) /b _5S(p-i)^ 
where  stands for the trace over the Dirac matrices.

We now follow Refs.  and use the expansion
iden 
1/p -i/ -m =1/p -m +
1/p -m i/ 1/p -m +which is valid up to first order in , which is the expression
we need to generate the Chern-Simons-like term. With this we
change  and rewrite it in the form
pi1 
_1 ^ =tr d^4p (2)^4 S(p)/b _5S(p)
^ S(p)i/ S(p)^ 
Also, we change  to write
pi21 
_2^ =tr d^4p (2)^4 S(p)
^ S(p)/b _5S(p)i/ S(p)^ 
and
pi22 
_3^ =tr d^4p (2)^4 S(p)^ 
S(p)i/ S(p)/b _5S(p)^ 
We work with . It can be written as
, where
_1,div  ^ =ib_ tr d^4p (2)^4 
/p ^ _5/p ^ 
/p / /p ^  (p^2-m^2)^4 
and
pi1fin 
_1,fin  ^ &=&im^2b_ tr d^4p (2)^4 1 (p^2-m^2)^4 (/p ^ 
_5/p ^ / ^ +/p

&&/p ^ _5^ / 
/p ^ +^ _5/p ^ 
/p / ^ +^ _5
/p ^ / /p ^ +

^  )
The other two terms  and  are similar,
and are treated similarly.

We evaluate the integrals under the general guidance of dimensional
regularization. Thus, we change dimensions from
 to , and we change  to
, where  is an arbitrary
parameter that identifies the mass scale. We use two distinct routes
to do the calculations involving the Dirac matrices. In the first route
we use the ciclic property of the trace, to move  to the very
end of every expression involving the trace of Dirac matrices. The
potential divergences in the momentum integration come from the first
term of . We use
d^2w p (2)^2w  p_ p_ p_ 
p_  (p^2-m^2)^4 =i 24(4)^w 
(2-w) (m^2)^2-w  G_ 
where 
.
We also use  and
 in order to
rewrite Eq. () in the form
ifinal 
I^(1,2) [b,A]=32i(w)b_ tr (^ 
^ ^ ^ _5)d^4x
_ A_ A_ 
Here the factor  accounts for identical contributions
that comes from ,  and
. Also,  is given by
piw 
(w)=-2w-1 96^2 +w+1 96^2 (4^2 m^2 
)^2-w (2-w)(2-w)
In the above calculations we have set

to split the  contribution into two parts, one divergent
and the other finite. The contribution 
is divergent in the limit , and it contribute with the term
proportional to . However, the factor involving the Dirac
matrices contributes with the term , in a way such that the full
contribution is finite in the limit . Furthermore, this finite term
exactly compensates the finite contribution that appears from
 in the limit . In the limit
 we can use 

, but  and this
leaves no room for Lorentz and CPT violation. The perfect balance between
the two contributions that we have just found has been identified before
in Ref.   as being peculiar to dimensional regularization. We
stress that if one uses the relation  to move
 to the end of every expression involving the trace of Dirac
matrices, the perfect balance between the two contributions is broken,
giving rise to a non zero value for the constant . This result is
due to the use of , which is valid in the
four dimensional spacetime, but we are working in  dimensions.

We make this point stronger by considering another route to implement the
calculation involving properties of the Dirac matrices when the spacetime
has dimension . We follow and now the Dirac matrices
corresponding to the external indices  and  are physical
matrices; they are written in the form , etc.
The contribution
tr (^  ^ _5^ 
 ^ ^ ^ ^ 
 ^ )G_ 
splits into the three terms
tr (^  ^ _5_ 
 ^ ^ ^ _  ^ )
+tr (^  ^ _5^ 
 ^ _ ^ _  ^ )
+tr (^  ^ _5^ 
 ^ _ ^ _  ^ )
and the Dirac matrices are changed according to
, where
,
,
and , and also
,
 and
.
In this case we can use either the ciclic property of the trace, or the
relations 
to rewrite Eq. () in the form
I^(1,2) [b,A]=32^ (w)b_ d^4x
^ _ A_ A_ 
where we have used


 and 
. Also,
. We use this result to
write Eq. () as in the Chern-Simons-like term in Eq. (),
where , with  given by
C 
C=2w-1 16^2 -1+w 16^2 
(4^2 m^2 )^2-w (2-w)(2-w)
We see that  in the limit , which confirms the former result,
in which we have used the ciclic property of the trace.

We now consider the spacetime noncommutative
. In this case we set
, where  is a constant
antisymmetric tensor. As a consequence, one replaces the ordinary product of
functions by the Moyal product
f(x)g(x)=e^i 2 ^ _ 
^ _  
f(x)g(x^ )_x^ =x 
The first modification we have
to introduce concerns Eq. (), which should be changed to
fnc 
I _f=d^4x  (i/ -m-/b 
_5-/A )or better
I _f=d^4x  (x)(i/ ^ -m-/b 
_5-e^i^  /A )(x^ )
_x^ =x 
where we are working with the fundamental (or anti-fundamental) representation,
of the gauge group, using 
. In this
case Eq. () should be changed to
csnc 
I _CS =d^4x^ 
 _ ( _ A_ A_ +2 3 i
A_ A_ A_ )
where  must have the form ,
to include modifications coming from the noncommutativity of spacetime.

We are working with the fundamental representation of the gauge group.
In this case noncommutativity seems to appear changing the gauge field
 by the new field , and this
identification ease the work we have to implement, since we now see
that the above modification changes Eq. () to
I 
I ^ [b,A]=iTr  _n=1 ^ 1n
[1/p -m-/b _5 
e^p /A(x) ]^n
and now we single out the term
I ^(2) [b,A]=i 2Tr [1/p -m-/b 
_5 e^p /A(x) 1/p -m-/b 
_5 e^^ p 
/A(x^ ) ]_x^ =x 
which modifies the former calculations as follows: we rewrite
Eq. () in the form
ea2 
I ^(1,2) [b,A]=i 2 d^4x ( _a^ +
 _b^ ) A_ A_ ^ _x^ =x 
where the terms  and 
are now given by
 _a^ =tr d^4p (2)^4  S(p)/b 
_5S(p)^ S(p-i)^ 
e^(+^ )p 
and
 _b^ =tr d^4p (2)^4  S(p)^ 
S(p-i)/b _5S(p-i)^ 
e^(+^ )p 
In both cases, expanding the phase factors and propagators up to first order
in the derivative the result adds to zero, like it did in the commutative case.
Thus, in the Chern-Simons-like contribution that appear in Eq. (),
the term proportional to  remains
as in the former result in the commutative case.

In the noncommutative case there is another contribution, trilinear
in the gauge field, which comes from Eq. () for . This
contribution is given by
I ^(3) [b,A]=i 3 Tr [1 
/p-m-/b _5 e^p /A (x)
1 /p-m-/b _5 e^^ p 
/A (x^ )1 /p-m-/b _5 
e^^ p /A (x^ )
]_x^ =x^ =x 
We use Eq. () to write, selecting the terms that are linear
in ,
I ^(1,3) [b,A]&=&i 3 Tr S(p)[e^ p 
/A (x)S(p)e^^ p /A (x^ )S(p)
/b _5S(p)+e^ p 
/A (x)S(p)/b _5S(p)e^ ^ p 
/A (x^ )S(p)+

&&/b _5S(p)e^ p 
/A (x)S(p)e^ ^ p 
/A (x^ )S(p)]
e^ ^ p 
/A (x^ )_x^ =x^ =x 
We use the identity () to write
i31 
I ^(1,3) [b,A]=i 3 d^4x _n=1 ^3
_n^ e^(+^ +^ )
p A_ A^ _ A^ _ 
_x^ =x^ =x 
where
G1 
_1^ =tr d^4p (2)^4 
S(p)/b _5S(p)^ S(p)^ S(p)^ 
and
G2 
_2^ =tr d^4p (2)^4 
S(p)^ S(p)/b _5S(p)^ S(p)^ 
and
G3 
_3^ =tr d^4p (2)^4 
S(p)^ S(p)^ S(p)/b _5S(p)^ 
These three terms are very similar to the three terms ,
 and  that we have found in
Eqs. (), () and () of the former calculation.
They contribute similarly, and we can write, expanding the phase factor
up to zeroth order in the derivative,
I ^(1,3) [b,A]=i(w)d^4 xb_ 
^ A_ A_ A_ 
where  - see Eq. ().
We then add  and  to write
Eq. () in the form
I _CS =Cd^4 x^ 
b_ (_ A_ A_ +23i
A_ A_ A_ )
where  is given in Eq. (), the same result obtained in the
commutative case. Thus, in the limit  there is no room
for Lorentz and CPT violation also in the noncommutative case that we
have just considered.

We can also work with the adjoint representation of the gauge group. In this
case, in the fermionic action in Eq. () we should change  to
; also, we
include an extra factor of  in this fermionic action, in order to
account for the use of Majorana spinors. The change in the gauge field
is similar to the identification done in the former case,
for the fundamental representation. The calculation is similar, and the
procedure that we follow is: the phase factors that appear from non-planar
diagrams are also expanded up to first order in the derivative, in order
to maintain the original program of searching for contributions linear
in the derivative and bilinear in the gauge field, and trilinear in the
gauge field. Within this context, the result in Eq. () should
be changed to
ea21 
I ^(1,2) _ad [b,A]=i 2 d^4x ( _a,ad ^ +
 _b,ad ^ ) [A_ ,A^ _ ]_ 
_x^where the terms  and 
are now given by
 _a,ad ^ =tr d^4p (2)^4  S(p)/b 
_5S(p)^ S(p)^ (p)
and
 _b,ad ^ =tr d^4p (2)^4  S(p)^ 
S(p)/b _5S(p)^ (p)
We have
 _a,ad ^ =b_ tr d^4p (2)^4 
p (p^2-m^2)^3 (/p ^_5
/p ^/p ^+m^2/p 
^_5^^)
We use dimensional regularization in order to write
d^2w p (2)^2w  
p_p_ (p^2-m^2)^3 =
i (1-w) 4(4)^w (1-w) (m^2)^2-w  
g_ 
and
d^2w p (2)^2w  
p_p_p_p_ (p^2-m^2)^3 =
-i m^2 8(4)^w (1-w) (m^2)^2-w  
G_ 
We use the above results to get
pia 
 _a,ad ^ =-m^2 16^2 
(4^2 m^2 )^2-w (1-w)(3-w)
^ b_ _where .

The calculation involving  is similar. It gives the
result , showing that
the contribution bilinear in the gauge field vanishes, as it did in the former
case.

In the noncommutative case there is another contribution, trilinear
in the gauge field, similar to Eq. (). It contributes with
I ^(1,3) _ad [b,A]=i 3 d^4x _n=1 ^3
_n,ad ^ [[A_,A^ _]_ ,
A^ _]_ _x^ =x^ =x 
where
_n,ad ^ =_n ^ (p)
and  stand for the three contributions given
by Eqs. (), (), and (). These results show that
there is no trilinear contribution independent of the derivative.

The above considerations lead to the result that there is no room for
Lorentz or CTP violation, despite the representation one chooses for the
gauge group. Our results show that there is no UV/IR mixing in the calculation
of the induced Chern-Simons term, even when non-planar diagrams are taken into
account, as it happens in the adjoint representation of the gauge group.

We summarize our work recalling that we have calculated the radiative
corrections induced by massive and charged Dirac fermions, interacting
with Abelian gauge field and including a non standard contribution
that violates Lorentz and CPT invariance. Our results show that
there is an intricate entanglement between infinitely large contributions
that come from integration in momentum space, and infinitely small
contributions that appear from the trace of Dirac matrices. These two
contributions compensate each other, and they do contribute to generate
a term that exactly cancels the finite term that appears from
the remaining contributions. Because of this intricate cancellation,
there is no room for radiative generation of the Chern-Simons-like
term. Thus, there is neither Lorentz nor CPT violation generated
radiatively. This result is valid under the general guidance
of dimensional regularization, despite the spacetime be commutative
or noncommutative.
