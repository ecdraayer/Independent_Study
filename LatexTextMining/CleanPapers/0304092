We propose a set of conventional Bethe Ansatz equations and a
corresponding expression for the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix
for the open spin- XXZ quantum spin chain with nondiagonal
boundary terms, provided that the boundary parameters obey a certain
linear relation.



Introduction 
Consider the open spin- XXZ quantum spin chain with
nondiagonal boundary terms, defined by the HamiltonianH  &=& 12  _n=1 ^N-1 ( 
_n ^x _n+1 ^x +_n ^y _n+1 ^y 
+ _n ^z _n+1 ^z )

&+&[ 
_-  _1 ^z 
+ 2 _- _-  ( _- _1 ^x  
+ i_- _1 ^y  ) 

&-& _+  _N ^z 
- 2 _+ _+  ( _+ _N ^x 
+ i_+ _N ^y  )
]  ,
where  are the usual Pauli
matrices,  is the bulk anisotropy parameter, 
 are arbitrary boundary parameters, and 
is the number of spins.  This is the prototypical integrable quantum 
spin chain with boundary. It is related to many other models, 
including the sine-Gordon field theory. Moreover, this model 
has applications in various branches of physics, including condensed 
matter and statistical mechanics.

This model has resisted solution for many years (see, e.g.,
).  The main difficulty is that, in contrast to the special
case of diagonal boundary terms (i.e., ) considered in
, a simple pseudovacuum (reference) state does not
exist.  For example, the state with all spins up 
 is not an eigenstate
of the Hamiltonian.

We recently formulated a method of deriving the Bethe
Ansatz solution of integrable spin chain (vertex-type) models
which does not rely on the existence of a pseudovacuum state.  In
particular, we used this method to solve the model ()
for the special case 
_+  = _-  , 
_+  = _-  , 
_+  = _-  = 0, N =  odd  .
Here we propose the solution for a more general case.  Indeed, in
terms of the boundary parameters 
introduced below in Eq.  (), we find an expression
for the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix corresponding to the
Hamiltonian
H  &=& 12  _n=1 ^N-1 ( 
_n ^x _n+1 ^x +_n ^y _n+1 ^y 
+ _n ^z _n+1 ^z )

&+&[ 
_-  _- _1 ^z 
+ _-  _- ( 
_- _1 ^x  
+ i_- _1 ^y  ) 

&-& _+  _+  _N ^z 
+ _+  _+ ( 
_+ _N ^x 
+ i_+ _N ^y  )
]  ,
where the boundary parameters are subject to the linear relation
_-  + _-  + _+  + _+  = (_-  - 
_+ ) + k ,
where  is an even integer if  is odd, and is an odd integer 
if  is even.
In the recent paper, similar results have been obtained 
by a different approach.

The outline of this article is as follows.  In Section
, we briefly review the construction of the model's
transfer matrix, and list some of its important properties.  In
Section , we find the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix
by the three-step procedure formulated in.  The first two
steps, which lead to a functional relation for the transfer matrix,
are the same as in, except for the introduction of the
parameters .  The principal new results appear at
the third step, where we succeed to recast the functional relation
in terms of a determinant for the more general case
().  We conclude with a brief discussion of our
results in Section .


The transfer matrix 
The fundamental transfer matrix 
corresponding to the model () is given byt(u) = _0  K^+ _0 (u)  
T_0 (u)  K^- _0 (u) T_0 (u),
where the monodromy matrices are given by
T_0 (u) = R_0N (u) R_01 (u) ,  
T_0 (u) = R_10 (u) R_N0 (u) , 
and the  matrix is the solution of the Yang-Baxter equation given
by
R(u) = (   ) .

Moreover, the  matrix is the solution of the boundary
Yang-Baxter equation given byK^- (u) = (   ) ,

which evidently depends on three boundary parameters 
. It is related to the symmetric matrix 
 used inby a gauge transformation,
K^- (u) =  K^- (u)__- =0  ^-1  , 
with
= (   ) .

The matrix  is equal to  with
 replaced by 
. Finally, 
 denotes trace over the (two-dimensional)
"auxiliary space" 0.  Further details about the construction of this
transfer matrix can be found in.

The transfer matrix constitutes a one-parameter 
commutative family of matrices
[ t(u), t(v) ] = 0  .

The Hamiltonian () is related to the first derivative
of the transfer matrix,
H  = c_1  u  t(u) _u=0  
+ c_2  ,
where
c_1  = 14 _-  _+  ^2N-1  
  , 
c_2  = - ^2 + N ^2 2   
,

and  is the identity matrix.
The two relations (),() 
signal that the model is integrable. Moreover, it is evident that in 
order to determine the energy eigenvalues, it suffices to determine 
the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix.

The transfer matrix has the periodicity property
t(u + i )= t(u) ,
as well as crossing symmetry
t(-u - )= t(u) ,
and the asymptotic behavior (for )
t(u) -_- _+  (_- -_+ )
e^u(2N+4)+(N+2) 2^2N+1   + 
for  u.
Bethe Ansatz solution 
We now proceed to find an expression for the transfer matrix 
eigenvalues using the method formulated in. This method 
consists of three main steps:

Step 1: fusion hierarchy 
The first step is to obtain the model's so-called fusion hierarchy. 
The transfer matrix () is actually the first (
) member of an infinite hierarchy of commuting transfer matrices
 corresponding to spin- (i.e., -dimensional)
auxiliary spaces, .  Using
the fusion procedure for  and matrices, one finds that these higher-level transfer matrices obey the
relations
t^(j) (u) &=& _2j-1 (2u+ (2j-1) ) [
t^(j-12 ) (u) t^(12 ) (u+ (2j-1)) 

&-& (u+(2j-2)) _2j-2 (2u+ (2j-2) )  
(2u+ 2(2j-1))  t^(j-1) (u) ] , 
with , and . 
The quantum determinant  is given by
(u) &=&
 -[(u + + _- ) (u + - _- )
+ _- ^2  ^2 (2u+2) ] 

&& [(u + + _+ ) (u + - _+ )
+ _+ ^2  ^2 (2u+2) ] 

&& 2u (2u+4) (u + )^2N  ,
and
_j (u) &=& _k=1 ^j  (u + k ) , 
_0 (u) = 1  , 

(u) &=& -(u+) (u-) .


These relations are the same as those for the case of symmetric 
matrices ().  We remark that the spin-
matrix  is related to the
corresponding matrix with  by a generalization of the
gauge transformation (),
K^- _1 2j  (u) =
_1  _2j 
K^- _1 2j  (u)__- =0 
_2j ^-1  _1 ^-1  .


Step 2: truncation at roots of unity 
The second step is to observe that for anisotropy values
= i p+1 , p= 1 , 2 , ,
(and hence  is a root of
unity, satisfying ), the level- transfer
matrix can be expressed in terms of a transfer matrix of one level
lower,
t^(p+12 ) (u) 
= (u) [ 
t^(p-12 ) (u+ )
+ (u) ]
. The quantities  and  are given by the
corresponding expressions (4.31) in, except with

and ,
as a consequence of (). 

This result provides an example of McCoy's dictum "Complicated is
simple".  Indeed, the essential point of this step is to
exploit the higher symmetry which occurs at roots of unity to help
solve the model.

Combining the fusion hierarchy () and the truncation
identity (or "closing relation") () for the  values 
(), we arrive at a functional relation for the 
fundamental transfer matrix  (and hence, 
for the corresponding eigenvalues ) of order  
:
(u) (u +) (u + p )  

&-& (u-) (u +) (u +2) 
(u + (p-1)) 

&-& (u) (u +2) (u +3)
(u + p ) 

&-& (u+) (u) (u +3) (u +4) 
(u + p ) 

&-& (u+2) (u) (u +) (u +4) 
(u + p ) - 

&-& (u+(p-1)) (u) (u +) 
(u +  (p-2)) 

&+& = f(u) ,

where  is defined by
(u) = (u)(2u+2)  .
Moreover, the 
function  is given by 
f(u) &=& (-1)^p (N+1) 2^2p(N+1)   ^2N ((p+1)u) 
^2 ((p+1)u +i 2 )^2 ((p+1)u) 


&&  
n(u ; _-  , _- ) n(u ; -_+  , _+ ) +
n(u ; -_-  , _- ) n(u ; _+  , _+ ) 

&&+ 2(-1)^N  (-_-  _+ )^p+1  ^2 (2(p+1)u) 
((p+1)(_-  - _+ ))  ,
where  equals 0 if  is even, and
equals 1 if  is odd; and the function  is
defined by
n(u ; , ) = ( (p+1)(+u) )  
+ _l=1 ^[p+12 ] c_p, l  
^2l  ( (p+1)u + (p+1 - 2l) ) ,

with
c_p , l  = (p+1)l!  _k=0 ^l-2  (p-l-k) 
. 
For instance, for the case , the functional relation is given 
by 
(u) (u +) (u +2) (u +3) 
- (u-) (u +) (u +2) 


 - (u) (u +2) (u +3) 
- (u +) (u) (u +3)   
- (u +2) (u) (u +)  
 
+ (u) (u +2)
+ (u-) (u +) = f(u) .

 
Step 3: determinant representation 
Following the strategy used in to solve RSOS models, the
third and final step is to rewrite the functional relation as the
determinant of a  matrix.  Let us assume that this
matrix has the same form as the one for the diagonal case
() and for the case ().  That is, we
assume the functional relation can be cast in the form(
  ) = 0 ,
where , , 
, 

h'(u) = h(-u-2) , 

and the function  is yet to be determined.  We find that the
functional relation () can indeed be recast in the form
(), provided that  satisfies the three
conditions
h(u + i ) &=& h(u)  

h(u+) h(-u-) &=& (u) ,  

_j=0 ^p  h(u+j) + _j=0 ^p  h(-u-j) &=& f(u) 
.  
The results for  in the diagonal case and in the case
() suggest that, in general,  has form

h(u) = -^2N (u+)(2u+2)(2u+) 
g_- (u) g_+ (u) ,  
where the functions  contain all the dependence on the
boundary parameters.

Then second condition () together with
(), () and () imply that
g_- (u) g_+ (u) g_- (-u) g_+ (-u) &=& 
(^2 u -^2  _-  
+ _- ^2  ^2 2u ) 

&& (^2 u -^2  _+  
+ _+ ^2  ^2 2u )
. 
This suggests that  obey the functional equation
g_ (u) g_ (-u) = -(^2 u -^2  _  
+ _ ^2  ^2 2u ) .
Assuming that the functions  are given by
g_ (u) = 2 _  (u + _ ) (u + _ ) 
,
then () implies that the parameters , 
 obey
^2  _  ^2  _  
= 14_ ^2   ^2  _  , 
^2 _  ^2 _ 
= 14_ ^2   ^2  _  .
A similar reparametrization appears in.  Below we
shall argue that () is essentially the unique solution of
().

The third condition () together with () and
() imply that (Note that the right-hand-side 
of () depends on  only through its parity .) 
& &_j=0 ^p  g_- (u+j) g_+ (u+j) + 
_j=0 ^p  g_- (-u-j) g_+ (-u-j) 
 
&=& (-1)^p 2^2p    
n(u ; _-  , _- ) n(u ; -_+  , _+ ) +
n(u ; -_-  , _- ) n(u ; _+  , _+ ) 

&&+ 2(-1)^N  (-_-  _+ )^p+1  ^2 (2(p+1)u) 
((p+1)(_-  - _+ ))  ,
where  is given by Eq. ().
We find that this requirement can be satisfied for 
, with   given by () 
and (The requirement of including the special case
(), which corresponds to 
, , , helps to
resolve the sign ambiguity in passing from ()
to ().) 
_-  _-  &=& 12_-   _-  , 
_-  _-  = 12_-   _-  , 


_+  _+  &=& -12_+   _+  , 
_+  _+  = -12_+   _+  , 
provided that the various parameters obey the linear constraint
_-  + _-  + _+  + _+  = (_-  - 
_+ ) + k ,
where  is an even integer if  is odd, and is an odd integer 
if  is even.

In short, the functional relations can be cast in the determinant 
form () for  with

h(u) &=& -^2N (u+)(2u+2)(2u+)  


&& 4 _-  _+  (u + _- ) (u + _- ) 
(u + _+ ) (u + _+ ) 
,  
where ,  are defined by ()
and satisfy the constraint ().

We now proceed as in, and assume that the matrix
in () has the null vector
. That is,
_0  Q_0  - h'_-1  Q_1  - h_0  Q_p  &=& 0 ,  


-h_k  Q_k-1  + _k  Q_k  - h'_k-1  Q_k+1  &=& 0 , k = 1, , p-1  , 

-h'_p-1  Q_0  - h_p  Q_p-1  + _p  Q_p   &=& 0 .
We make the Ansatz , where  is given by
Q(u) = _j=1 ^M  (u - u_j ) (u + u_j  + ) ,

which has the crossing symmetry . The zeros 
of  are still to be determined.
Eqs. () and () imply
that the eigenvalues are given by
(u) = h(u) Q(u-)Q(u)  
+ h(-u-) Q(u+)Q(u)   .
 
We verify that this result is consistent with both
the periodicity () and crossing 
() properties of the transfer matrix.
The requirement that  be analytic at  
yields the Bethe Ansatz equations
h(u_j )h(-u_j -)  = 
-Q(u_j +)Q(u_j -)  , 
j = 1 , , M .
The asymptotic behavior (), together with the result
() for the eigenvalues and the constraint
(), imply that the number  of Bethe roots is given
by
M=12 (N-1+k) ,
where  is the integer appearing in ().
We leave to a future investigation the interesting question of
determining further restrictions on the value of , which presumably
is related to the question of completeness.

We now argue that () is essentially the unique solution of 
(). 
Indeed, if  are also solutions of 
(), then 
g_- (u) g_+ (u) = g_- (u) g_+ (u) (u) ,
where  are given by (), and  satisfies
(u) (-u) = 1 .
The periodicity condition () implies that 
has the same periodicity
(u + i ) = (u) .
We infer from () and () that  is a
CDD-like factor
(u) = _j  (u + v_j )(u - v_j )  .
The requirement that  be analytic then restricts  
to the form
(u) = q(u - )q(u)  , where  
q(u) = _j  (u - v_j ) (u + + v_j ) .
This is equivalent to having additional Bethe roots, which can be 
included in  ().

Although the above results for the eigenvalues (),
(), () have been obtained under the
assumption that  is restricted to the values ()
with  odd, we expect that these results remain valid for generic
values of .  Indeed, we have explicitly verified that these
expressions reproduce the correct eigenvalues for  (with )
and  (with ) for arbitrary .

Conclusion 
Our proposed expression for the eigenvalues  of the
transfer matrix () corresponding to the Hamiltonian
() is given by (), where
 and  are given by () and (),
respectively; the Bethe Ansatz equations are given by
(), with  given by (); and the
parameters ,  (which are related to
,  by ()) must satisfy the
constraint ().

It remains an open question whether a solution with Bethe Ansatz
equations of the "conventional" form () can be found
which does not require a constraint among the boundary parameters. 
(Although the solution proposed in does not require any
constraint among the boundary parameters, it holds only for the 
values (), and the Bethe Ansatz equations are not of
the conventional form.)

For the special case (), an analysis of the
thermodynamic () limit and an extension to
higher-dimensional representations has recently been given in
.  For the more general case discussed here, it should now be
possible to address such questions, and also to find generalizations
to higher rank-algebras, both for the trigonometric and elliptic
cases.
