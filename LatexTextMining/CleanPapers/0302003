We study intertwining for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with
special emphasis to the two-dimensional generalized Morse potential,
which does not allow for separation of variables. The complexified
methods of separation of variables and two-dimensional shape
invariance are used to construct particular solutions - both for
complex conjugated energy pairs and for non-paired complex energies.

1. Introduction 

*3ex 
Recently invariance of one-dimensional models in Quantum
Mechanics has been investigated by C.Bender and collaborators
-(see also)
with special emphasis on the spectrum of the
associated Hamiltonians. Since in many cases the spectrum was found to be real,
invariance was proposed as a generalization of standard Hermiticity.
However it soon became clear that there are simple symmetric examples,
for which the spectrum is not real and therefore alternative criteria
for reality of the spectrum were explored.

The most systematic investigation has been performed by
A.Mostafazadeh-(see also,)
elaborating on the so-called pseudo-Hermiticity:
H ^-1  = H^  with  a Hermitian invertible operator, expressed
in terms of a biorthogonal basis. This type of approach requires
a complete solution of the spectral problem.

For non-solvable problems, it is convenient to use the
intertwining relations of SUSY Quantum Mechanics (SUSY QM)
,to relate pairs
of Hamiltonians. One Hermitian and one non-Hermitian Hamiltonian
may be intertwined,,or, in other cases, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians may be
intertwined-(pseudo-Hermiticity ) with their Hermitian conjugates.
Both these constructions might lead to complex models with real spectra.
We would like to remark that pseudo-Hermiticity differs from
the pseudo-supersymmetry of.

While one dimensional models of this kind have been
investigated in many different frameworks like SUSY QM,
,,,
 symmetry-,
-,,
for two dimensions the advance is really at the start. To our
knowledge there are only the papers and
, where some
complex two-dimensional potentials are studied numerically,
which are symmetric and therefore are
two dimensional extensions of the  potential.

Within SUSY QM a class of non-trivial two-dimensional
models (not allowing for separation of variables) was constructed in
-. One model of this class (generalized
singular Morse
potential) was investigated in detail by two novel methods:
separation of variables  and two-dimensional shape
invariance .
The model is partially solvable (see, for example
)
or, in alternative terminology, quasi-exactly-solvable
,,
this means that only part of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be found.

In Section 2 we introduce pseudo-Hermiticity 
with supercharges of first and second order in derivatives in one and two
dimensions. In Section 3 the complexification of two-dimensional model
of is implemented in the context of pseudo-Hermiticity
with special attention to the appearance of levels in
complex conjugated pairs. In particular, Subsection 3.1 contains
the separation of variables method, and 3.2 - the
complex form of the two-dimensional shape invariance method.


2.SUSY QM and pseudo-Hermiticity. 

*3ex 
For the case of Hermitian Hamiltonians
the main algebraic relation of SUSY Quantum Mechanics
,,
in all possible
formulations and generalizations (for example,- )
is given by intertwining relations:
HQ^+ = Q^+H;  

Q^-H = HQ^-;Q^- = (Q^+)^  for a pair of Schrodinger operators (superpartners):



These relations connect eigenfunctions with the same
eigenvalues (up to zero modes of ):







For compactness we do not introduce explicitly an index associated to
possible degeneracy.

If  and  are non-Hermitian, the two intertwining relations
() and () may become independent,
and the supercharges
 not necessarily Hermitian conjugate. A particular case,
considered earlier,  - Hermitian,
and  - not, leads to the reality of the spectrum of 

Another possibility is to examine non-Hermitian partner Hamiltonians
related by what we call pseudo-Hermiticity :
Q^+H = H^ Q^+ ;

HQ^- = Q^-H^ . Since we deal with scalar potentials, Hermitian and complex conjugations
are equivalent for our purposes (see also).
The eigenstates of  with eigenvalues  will be
denoted by
 with eigenvalues 
They are related to those of
 not only by the intertwining but also by direct conjugation.
This has been established by using the formalism of the biorthogonal expansion
-.
The operator  has in general zero modes becoming non-invertible.

As a consequence of Eq.(), one can obtain a relation which can be useful
for the classification of the spectrum:
(E_n - E_m^ ) <_E_m  Q^+_E_n > = 0.
First, let us notice that diagonal matrix elements in the subspace of
zero modes of  are trivially zero. So, in this case ()
does not provide any restriction on the energy  which in
particular can be complex having no complex conjugate partner.
Clearly, a non-zero value of the matrix element in ()
for  outside the subspace, considered above,
implies that the energy  is real, while off-diagonal
non-vanishing matrix element signals that complex energies appear
in complex conjugated pairs 

For introducing pseudo-Hermiticity we provide an explicit
exhaustive construction
in the framework of complex SUSY QMin one-dimension with first order supercharges
,.
In this case without loss of generality:







with  an arbitrary complex number and  an arbitrary real function,
leading to the potential:



In this case the equation for zero modes of  has no
normalizable solution, so that pseudo-Hermiticity is effectively
equivalent to pseudo-Hermiticity (). Connection with usual
symmetry can be established by choosing  to be of even parity.
Second order generalizations (HSUSY) of one-dimensional supercharges
 for pseudo-Hermiticity were recently
discussed,.

For two-dimensional SUSY QM models solutions of the intertwining
relations () for scalar Schrodinger
Hamiltonians only exist with second order supercharges
- and only particular solutions
have been found  by suitable ansatzes.
For the supercharges with Lorentz metricsQ^+ = (_1^2 - _2^2)
+  C_k _k + B = 4_+_- +C_+_- +
C_-_+ + B, a solution of () can be provided-by solving the system:
&&_-(C_- F) =
-_+(C_+ F);

&&_+^2 F = _-^2 F,where 
 and  depend only on
 respectively:



The function
 solution of (), is represented as

The potentials  and the function 
are expressed
in terms of  and 
solutions of the system (), ():
V&=&1 2 (C_+' + C_-') + 1 8 (C_+^2 + C_-^2) +
1 4 ( F_2(x_+ -x_-) - F_1(x_+ + x_-)) ,

V&=&-1 2 (C_+' + C_-') + 1 8 (C_+^2 + C_-^2) +
1 4 ( F_2(x_+ -x_-) - F_1(x_+ + x_-)) ,

B&=&1 4 ( C_+ C_- + F_1(x_+ + x_-) + F_2(x_+ - x_-)) .
The linear character of Eq.() in  allows to multiply
 by the
imaginary unit keeping  real. This sort
of complexification renders  of Eq.()
complex conjugate to  Thus the intertwining relations ()
in this case lead automatically to pseudo-Hermiticity.
For the two-dimensional models the existence of zero modes of  can not
be avoided: actually in the class of models studied inthe equation
for zero modes allows separation of variables (separation of variables).
Thus these zero modes can be
constructed from normalizable solutions of two one-dimensional equations
of second order (see Section 3 of). In fact, the similarity
relation, which eliminates first order derivatives from the supercharges,
is now unitary.

The next Section will consider the complexification of the partially solvable
(quasi-exactly-solvable) two-dimensional model studied in(generalized singular Morse potential).
The spectral problem was partially solved by two
methods, one based on the separation of variables and the second - on the
shape invariance. This model is a natural candidate to elucidate 
pseudo-Hermiticity in two dimensions because it is not amenable to separation of
variables. Furthermore in this model pseudo-Hermiticity is not
equivalent to pseudo-Hermiticity due to the existence of zero modes of 
and also because the spectral problem is not exactly solvable.

We stress that in the class of models ()
the partner Hamiltonians are not-factorizable in terms of supercharges  But there are symmetry
operators of fourth order in derivatives which can be factorized:
R=Q^-Q^+;R= Q^+Q^- .
3.Complex two-dimensional generalized (singular)
Morse potential. 

*3ex 
The model is definedin terms of a specific choice for 
and  in Eqs.() and ():












V^ (x;a)&&V^ (x;ia) =
-^2a(2a+i)^-2 (x_- 2 
) +

 &+&A [(-2x_1)-2 (-x_1) + (-2x_2)-2 (-x_2)];


V(x;a)&&V(x;ia) =
-^2a(2a-i)^-2 (x_- 2 ) +


 &+&A [(-2x_1)-2 (-x_1) + (-2x_2)-2 (-x_2)],
where  is an arbitrary positive constant, and  is a real parameter.
Below we will use for all operators and functions the "hat" notation
following the definitions above. We stress that only  for real 
values of the parameter  the model described above satisfies
pseudo-Hermiticity.

Within this complexification the supercharges   are Hermitian
because  in Eq.() commute
with  In contrast, the supercharges  for
 are Hermitian conjugate to  but after
the complexification  they are related by
complex conjugation: 
Q^ (a) = 4_+_- 4ia_-
4ia(x_- 2 )_+ + B(a).
The Hamiltonian has no definite symmetry, but
has a reflection symmetry 
in coordinate space (permutation symmetry). The supercharges ()
are odd. Therefore this model has vanishing diagonal matrix
elements in ().

In addition, the Hamiltonian has
a discrete symmetry (involution):
V(x;a)&=& V(x;-a+i 2 );


V(x;a)&=& V^ (x;-a).
3.1.The method of separation of variables. 
*3ex 
In order to apply the method,
one has to separate variables in 
Eq.(). This can be achieved by the transformation, which is unitary
for 
U(x;b) (-ib( x_+ +
(x_- 2 )dx_-) =
( A  _1_2 _2 -_1 )
^2ib ;


Q^- (0)U(x;b)Q^- (b)U^-1 (x;b) =
_1^2 -_2^2 +1 4 (F_1(2x_1)+F_2(2x_2)),
where



The zero modes of  can be parametrized as
(As a consequence of (), one can derive

) :
_n(x;a) &=& U(x;a)) _n(x;a);

_n(x) &=& (-_1+_2 2 ) (_1_2)^s_n 
F(-n, 2s_n +1; _1) F(-n, 2s_n +1; _2),
where  is the standard degenerate (confluent)
hypergeometric function, reducing to a polynomial for integer  and
s_n=A   -n-1 2  > 0. Normalizable eigenfunctions  of the
Hamiltonian  can be obtained
by linear superposition of zero modes () according to,
and their eigenvalues (after complexification ) read:
E_k(a) = -4ia^2s_k+4a^2^2+2_k;_k-A[1- A  (k+1 2 )]^2 < 0.
Since the operator  in () is unitary,
the condition
for normalizability of eigenfunctions  now
does not depend on the parameter  and is expressed by the inequality
(): 
The number of normalizable zero modes  is also
determined by this inequality.

Apparently, the energies () have nonzero imaginary part
but we remind that () is trivially satisfied by the vanishing
of the matrix elements ,
since we deal with zero modes of 

In order to find examples of complex conjugate energies we have to explore
states outside the linear space of zero modes of 
Following the procedure of, we construct three
eigenfunctions
^(i)  (x;a)_0(x;a)^(i)  (x;a),
with energies ( given in ()):
E^(i) (a)=E_0(a) + ^(i) (a),
and
&&^(1) (x;a) =
z_2^(4ia+1) ;^(1) (a)= ^2 (2s_0-1)(4ia +1);


&&^(2) (x;a) = z_2^(4ia+1) 
( z_1+2 4ia-2s_0+3  );^(2) (a)= 4^2 (s_0-1)(2ia + 1);


&&^(3) (x;a) =
z_1-2 4ia+2s_0-1 ;^(3) (a)= ^2 (4ia + 2s_0-1).
Here




In contrast to the case  where only
 is normalizable, all three eigenfunctions
() - () become normalizable after 
if
s_0 > 2. One can argue from Eq.() that 
are eigenfunctions of  with the eigenvalues
 As explained after (), this means that
 in addition to eigenvalues (), has
also the complex conjugate eigenvalues:
H(a)(Q^+^(i) (x;a))^  = (E^(i) (a))^ 
(Q^+^(i) (x;a))^ .
The condition of normalizability of all three wave functions in ()
coincides with ().
Orthogonality of all these wave functions can not be secured in general due
to non-Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian(Due to reflection
considerations one can however easily conclude that
) , but
a pseudo-orthogonality can be derived in agreement with the formalism
-of the biorthogonal expansion with particular components

 and 

<(^(i) )^ ^(j) > &=& 0ij 

<(^(i) )^ Q^-(^(j) )^ > &=& 0i,j=1,2,3


<Q^+^(i) Q^-^(j) > &=& 0ij Equations () can be derived by taking into accountthat wave functions  are
eigenfuctions of the symmetry operator
() with different eigenvalues. Equation () is proportional
to (). Eq.() follows from reflection
symmetry considerations ( are even and 
are odd).

Using the symmetry property () one can generate a new series
of levels 
of  by considering each eigenfunction
(and corresponding eigenvalues)
from (), (), () with parameter shift

  The partner eigenfunctions with complex conjugated
energies can also be constructed along the same line as ().


3.2.The shape invariance method. 
*3ex 
Starting from a Schrodinger equation with potential of ()



with  - arbitrary eigenfunction, taking into
account that 
we get:




>From the intertwining relation:



we obtain





Thereby, we are at the first stepof a "shape invariance
chain" of wave functions and eigenvalues for
a complex value of the parameter. Notice
that the definition of potentials now differs from that inby a constant shift  This leads to a vanishing of
 In addition, we remark that our construction will contain
complex values for the parameters in wave functions,
in operators etc only in intermediate steps,
but the parameter  will always be kept real.

We thus can construct an additional class of levels starting
from  an eigenstate of the kind

 etc
(see (), (), ()).
These states and their complex conjugated are
additional (particular) components of the biorthogonal basis and will fulfill
equations similar to (), (), ().

Iterating this procedure, one generates the shape invariance chain:
_n ^k(x; a) [ Q^-(a)Q^-(a+i 2 )Q^-(a+i)...
Q^-(a+i(k-1) 2 )
_E_n (x; a+ik 2 ) ] ,
associated to the energy




In particular, for  - linear combination
of zero modes of  (see ())
_E_n (x; a+ik 2 ) =
_E_n (x; a+ik 2 )
the eigenvalues are:



In order to investigate the normalizability of these eigenfunctions,
it is crucial to study their behaviour in  
plane following
different paths. As already discussed in Section 4.3. of
 for the case , the relevant
singularities should occur for the origin,
for  and for 
By using (), () and () for supercharges and wave
functions, one can study the suitable critical limits in the
following representation for the norm of ():
_n ^k(a)U^-1 (a)
Q^-(0)U(-i 2 )
Q^-(0)U(-i 2 ) ...
Q^-(0) U(-i 2 ) _k  times 
 U(2a+ik)_n, where the  dependence has been dropped for conciseness.
Normalizability can be established for
s_n A    - 1 2  - n > k ,
which is just the normalizability condition for ().
In other words the repeated application of  does not restrict
the relevant region of normalizability.

>From the same condition one can estimate the number of normalizable states
generated by successive applications of  operators in ().
It depends only on the value of the integer part:
 and does not depend on
 For example, in the case
of non-integer  the total number of
states can be estimated to be  in other words typically
 for large values of 

As a final remark, we would like to mention that analogous results for shape
invariance chains and their normalizability can be obtained for the model
 (before complexification), though they were not explicitly
discussed. In that case  are
interrelated by Hermitian conjugation, and the calculation of the norm of the
chain can be performed by an explicit introduction of the symmetry operator
 provided the arguments match. After this
it is clear that results equivalent to () hold.

Our main results can be summarized as follows.
In the context of the notion of pseudo-Hermiticity
two methods (already studied for
Hermitian models) - separation of variables
and two-dimensional shape invariance - were used to build
explicitly a set of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the complex
two-dimensional  singular Morse potential. This part of the spectrum
includes complex conjugated energy pairs and in addition non-paired
complex energies for states - linear superpositions of zero
modes of the intertwining operators.
In contradistinction to one-dimensional models, pseudo-Hermiticity and
-pseudo-Hermiticity are not equivalent for two-dimensional models
just due to the nontrivial role of the zero modes of the supercharges.
For two-dimensional scalar models the intertwining relations can only be
solved for second order supercharges, which a priori may have infinite
number of zero modes. Therefore in the two-dimensional case the intertwined
Hamiltonians are not anymore factorizable (compare with the factorizability
in pseudo-supersymmetry of), but  factorizable symmetry
operators () of fourth order in derivatives exist.

In the class of models  considered in and here
these symmetry operators cannot be
expressed in terms of  the Hamiltonians and in general signal their
integrability and
possible degeneracy of their spectra, though no direct evidence of such
degeneracy was found in the solved part of the spectrum.
We remind that in the  selected
energy eigenfunctions which were explored  were simultaneously
eigenfunctions of the symmetry operator, so
there was  no indication for degeneracy.
