Introduction 

The nature of boundary conditions in rational conformal field theories
(RCFTs) has been now fairly well understood
.
There are a set of conditions that
every consistent set of the boundary states
should satisfy, which is called the sewing relations
.
The Cardy condition is one of the sewing relations
and expresses the consistency of the annulus amplitudes without
insertion of vertex operators.
It is now recognized that
solving the Cardy condition is equivalent to finding
the non-negative integer valued matrix representation (NIM-rep)
of the fusion algebra under the assumption
of the completeness.
The classification problem of the possible boundary conditions
in the given RCFT is therefore related with those of NIM-reps of the fusion
algebra.

Since the fusion coefficients themselves form a representation of the fusion
algebra, we always have at least one NIM-rep for each fusion algebra,
which is realized by the fusion matrices and called the regular one.
Therefore the point is whether we have a non-trivial NIM-rep other than
the regular one.
If we do not require an integer-valued representation,
we have several one-dimensional ones realized by the (generalized)
quantum dimensions, which in general take values in irrational
numbers.
However the requirement for a representation to be NIM is so severe
that one finds a non-trivial NIM-rep
in only the limited cases.
On the other hand, it happens that
the number of possible NIM-reps is greater than one
and that we have several solutions for one particular fusion algebra.
Although these different NIM-reps are in general considered to be
corresponding to different modular invariants,
it is possible that two or more NIM-reps coexist in the
same modular invariant and are compatible with each other.

This issue of mutual consistency of different NIM-reps
has been studied in (see also)
for the case of the WZW models.
In the WZW model based on a group , 
the chiral algebra is an (untwisted) affine Lie algebra ,
and the regular NIM-rep describes the boundary conditions
preserving .
If the horizontal subalgebra of  has an automorphism ,
we can twist  by  to obtain a non-trivial 
boundary condition in the WZW model, and
one can find a non-trivial NIM-rep corresponding to the twisted
boundary condition. Eventually we obtain two types of
NIM-reps in one theory:
the regular and the twisted ones.
The mutual consistency of these two has been shown 
by calculating the annulus amplitude between two types of
the boundary states.
The twisted affine Lie algebra associated with  and
 plays an essential role in the calculation.

In this paper, 
we extend the analysis of the mutual consistency of different NIM-reps
for the WZW models
to an important class of CFTs, coset conformal field theories.
The boundary states in coset theories has been studied by several groups

.
In particular, it has been shown that one can construct a NIM-rep
of the  theory starting from those of  and .
Hence a non-trivial NIM-rep of  follows from the twisted NIM-reps
of  and , if  (or ) is equipped with 
an automorphism.
We calculate the overlap of the corresponding twisted Cardy states of 
with the untwisted ones, and show that the twisted states
are consistently defined in the diagonal modular invariant.
The overlap of the twisted boundary states is given by
the branching functions of the twisted affine Lie algebras associated
with the automorphism used for twisting the boundary condition.
As a check of our argument, we study in detail the diagonal coset theory
, which is equivalent
with the orbifold .
We construct the boundary states twisted by the automorphisms
of the unextended Dynkin diagram of , and
show their mutual consistency by identifying their counterpart
in the orbifold.
For the order-2 automorphism of , the resulting states
as well as the regular ones are realized by the usual Neumann
and Dirichlet boundary states of the orbifold.
For the triality of , however, the twisted states of the coset
theory correspond to neither the Neumann nor the Dirichlet
states. Rather they yield the conformal boundary states
that preserve only the Virasoro algebra.
The conformal boundary states have been constructed for the case of 
.
Our twisted states provide their generalization to . 

The organization of this paper is as follows.
We review some basic facts about the construction of NIM-reps in coset CFTs
in the next section.
In Section , we argue the mutual consistency
of different NIM-reps in coset theories.
In particular, we show that the twisted Cardy states of  are labeled
by the branching functions of the associated twisted affine Lie algebras
and have well-defined overlaps with the regular states.
In Section , we apply our method
to the diagonal coset theory 
to obtain the Cardy states twisted by the automorphisms of .
We treat three types of automorphisms: 
the order- automorphism  of ,
the order- automorphism  of  and
the permutation automorphism  of .
For  and , we show that there exist non-trivial
NIM-reps and give them in the explicit form.
For the permutation automorphism , however,
the resulting NIM-rep is shown to yield nothing new. 
In Section , using the equivalence of the 
coset theory with the orbifold , we map the twisted states
in the coset theory to the boundary states of the orbifold, in which
the mutual consistency of the boundary states is well understood.
We give some technical details in the Appendices.
The derivation of the conformal boundary states of  is reported
in Appendix .




Boundary states in coset theories 

In this section, we review the construction of
the Cardy states in coset theories developed in.


Conventions 

Let  be the chiral algebra of RCFT,
which is the Virasoro algebra or an extension thereof.
We denote by  the set of
all the possible irreducible representations of ,
and by  the vacuum representation.
For the WZW model based on the affine Lie algebra  at level ,
 is given by the set  of all the integrable highest-weight
representations of  at level .
Let  be the representation space for .
Then the character of the representation  is written as
  _() = __  q^L_0 - c 24   ,
where  and
 is the central charge of the theory.
The characters transform among themselves under the modular transformation
,
 _ (-1/)= _ 
                      S_ _ ().
The modular transformation matrix  is a symmetric unitary matrix.

The elements of  forms the fusion algebra

.
Here  are non-negative integers called the fusion
coefficients.
It is often useful to introduce the matrices
  (N_)_ ^=     .
One can show that   satisfy the fusion algebra
  N_N_= _      N_.
The Verlinde formula relates the fusion coefficients
 with the modular transformation
matrix ,
  N _  ^ 
     = _ 
       S_ S_ 
            S_   
            S_0  
     = _ 
            S_ ^() _ 
            S_  ,
where 
is the generalized quantum dimension
 ^() _ 
             =S_  S_0   .
In terms of the matrices ,
the Verlinde formula can be written in the form
  N _  = S ^()  S^  ,   ^()  = diag (^() _)_  .
The modular transformation matrix  diagonalizes
the fusion matrices .
The generalized quantum dimension
 is therefore
a one-dimensional representation of the fusion algebra
  ^() _^() _=
  _      ^() _.
A simple current  of a RCFT is an element in  whose
fusion with the elements in  induces
a permutation  of 
,
  (J) () = (J ) .
The set of all the simple currents forms an abelian group
which we denote by ,
  = J   J :simple current .
 is a multiplicative group in the fusion algebra.
The group multiplication is defined by the fusion.

A simple current  acts on the modular  matrix as follows,
  S_J    = S_  b_(J),
where  is the generalized quantum dimension of ,
(
We write  as 
since the action of  on  yields  itself.
) 
  b_(J)  = S_J   S_0    = ^(J) _.
In the matrix notation, the above relation can be
written as
  N_J S = S  b(J) ,
where

and .
Since 
is a one-dimensional representation of the fusion algebra,
 is a one-dimensional representation of ,
  b_(J J') = b_(J) b_(J') , J, J' .
Therefore  is of the form
  b_(J) = e^2i Q_(J)  , Q_(J) ,
  since any one-dimensional representation of a finite group takes
values in roots of unity.
The phase  is called the monodromy charge.


 theories 

The  theory is based on an embedding of
the affine Lie algebra  into .
A representation  of  is decomposed by
representations  of  as follows,
 _= _  _(;)  _.
The primary fields of the  theory are labeled by 
and the corresponding character is given by the branching functions.
We denote by  the set of all the possible primaries
in the  theory,
    = (; )  
       &^G, ^H, 

       &b^G_(J) = b^H_(J'),
        (J ; J' ) = (; ), (J, J')  .
Here   is the set of all the primaries in the   theory.

is the group of the identification currents
corresponding to the common center of  and .
 () expresses  the monodromy charge of
the  () theory.
The condition  is the selection rule
of the branching of representations,
while the relation  is
the field identification.

In this paper, we restrict ourselves to the case that
all the identification orbit have the same length ,
  N_0 = (J , J' ) ^G ^H 
               (J, J')  
      =   .
  In other words, there is no fixed point in the field identification
  (J , J' ) (, ),   (, ) ^G ^H,   (J, J') 1 .
The character of the coset theory is the branching
function  of the algebra
embedding .
From the branching rule eq:cosetbranching , we find
  _ ^G = _  _(;)  _ ^H .
The modular transformation -matrix of the  theory reads
  S _(;)(      = N_0 S_S_      = N_0 S_S^H_where  is the length of the identification orbit
eq:orbitlength  and  () is the -matrix of
the  () theory.
 is the representation conjugate to .

The fusion coefficients of the coset theory can be calculated
via the Verlinde formula eq:Verlinde ,
  N  _(; )( ^(  &= _(;)   
    
          S _(; )(; ) 
          S _() 
          S _()   
          S _(0; 0)(; )    

  &= 1 N_0  _(, ) ^G ^H 
         1 N_0  _(J, J')  
                        b^G_ (J) b^H_ (J')^-1  

         &          N_0^2
         
          S^G_  S^G_  S^G_   
         S^G_0   
         
          S^H_   S^H_  
               S^H_    
         S^H_0     

  &= _(J, J')  
     N ^G_ J ^     N ^H_ J' ^.
Here we used our assumption of no fixed points to rewrite the sum
  _(; )         1 N_0  _(, ) ^G ^H 
     1 N_0  _(J, J')  
                        b^G_ (J) b^H_ (J')^-1  .
The projection operator introduced above takes account of the selection
rule.


NIM-reps in RCFTs 

In the bulk theory, we have a pair of algebras  and ,
which correspond to the holomorphic and the anti-holomorphic
sectors, respectively.
The space  of the states in the bulk theory can therefore
be decomposed into the representations of  as
 = _,  
 M_   _   _    (M_  _0  ) .
The modular invariant partition function associated with this spectrum reads
  Z() = _,  
  M_   _()  _()  .
In this paper, we restrict ourselves to the case of the diagonal
invariant .

In the presence of boundaries,  and  are related with
each other via appropriate boundary conditions.
In the closed string channel,
we can describe boundary conditions in terms of boundary states,
which satisfy the following
gluing condition
   ((W_n) - (-1)^h W _-n )  _=0 .
Here  and  are the currents of
 and , respectively.
 is the conformal dimension of the currents and
 is an automorphism of the chiral algebra .
 induces an isomorphism 
of the representations  of the chiral algebra .
In order to keep the conformal invariance,  has to fix
the generators  of the Virasoro algebra,
  (L_n) = L_n .
In the following,
a boundary condition for  will be called
the twisted  type,
while  the untwisted  type.

We denote by  the set labeling the boundary states.
A generic boundary state 
satisfying the boundary condition eq:glue  is
a linear combination of the Ishibashi states   _= _ 
               _  ^  1 S_0   
                _               () .
Here  is a set labeling the Ishibashi states
compatible with the gluing automorphism  and the modular
invariant .
For the charge-conjugation modular invariant,  is given by the set
 of all the representations fixed by ,
  ^=    =  .
We normalize the Ishibashi states as follows,
   _  q^H_c   _=
  _ _() (, ^) ,
where

is the closed string Hamiltonian.

The coefficients  together with the sets 
and  should be chosen appropriately
for the mutual consistency of the boundary states.
Consider the annulus amplitude between two
boundary states  and ,
 Z_ = q ^H_c  
                 = _,
                          
                   _  ^ 
                   S_  
                        S_0   
                   _  ^  
                   _ ()
  = _  n_  ^_()
(, ) .
Here we denote by  the multiplicity
of the representation 
in ,
  n_  ^ 
     =_ 
     _  ^ 
                   ^() _ 
                   _  ^   .
In the matrix notation, this can be written as
  n_= ^()  ^,   (n_)_  ^ =n_  ^ ,   ()_  ^ =_  ^  .
Clearly,  are matrices with
non-negative integer entries for consistent boundary states.
In particular,  for the uniqueness of the vacuum
in the open string channel.
This condition for the consistency of the annulus amplitude
is called the Cardy condition and the boundary states satisfying
the Cardy condition are called the Cardy states.
Under the assumption of the completeness
,
the Cardy condition implies that  is a unitary matrix.
The matrices  are therefore related with the generalized quantum
dimensions via a similarity transformation eq:Cardymat 
and satisfy the fusion algebra
  n_n_= _      n_,   n_^T = n_   .
Since  take values in ,
 forms a non-negative integer matrix representation
(NIM-rep) of the fusion algebra.
For each set of the mutually consistent boundary states,
we have a NIM-rep  of the fusion algebra.
The simplest example is the regular NIM-rep
  = S   (n_ =N_ ,
which corresponds to the trivial gluing automorphism  in
the diagonal modular invariant
and exists in any RCFT.
We note that
there are many 'unphysical' NIM-reps that do not correspond
to any modular invariant.
This fact shows that the Cardy condition is not a sufficient
but a necessary condition for consistency.


The similarity between  and 
eq:Verlindemat eq:Cardymat  suggests that
the simple currents act also on a diagonalization matrix .
As is discussed in,
we actually have two types of actions of
the simple currents on ,
 
  _J   ^&= _ ^ b_(J), &
  n_J &=  b(J) , &
  J &  ,
   

  _  ^J  &= b _(J)  _ ^, &
  N_J^T &= b (J) , &
  J & .
  Here  and  are the groups of simple currents
for  and ,
 
    &= /  , 

    &=  J J:   ,
where  is the stabilizer of , i.e. ,
a subgroup of  which acts trivially on ,
   
     = J_0  J_0 = ,
                         
     = J_0  b_ (J_0)=1 ,
                         .
   are the counterpart of  and defined as
  b _(J)  =
  _  ^J  _  ^0   .
The group  acts on  as a permutation of the Cardy states,
and the group
 enables us to define the "charge" 
of the Cardy states,
which takes values in the dual group of .
Clearly, for the regular NIM-rep , these two groups
coincide with the simple current group  itself.

The transformation property eq:sconbrane  follows from
the fact that  is a permutation matrix on .
The second one eq:sconspec  is relatedwith the following algebra  _  ^  _  ^0  
  _  ^  _  ^0   =
  _  M _  ^  _  ^  _  ^0   ,
which coincides in some cases with 
the algebra that appeared in the classification problem
of the bulk theory.
Actually, if we set
  (M_)_ ^= M _  ^,    ^()  =
  diag 
  (
    _  ^  _  ^0  
  )_  ,
the algebra eq:Malgebra  can be written in the form
  M_ ^T  =   ^()  .
Hence, the transformation property eq:sconspec  follows
from eq.eq:Malgebra  if
 coincides with
 restricted on .


We are now ready to state the construction of NIM-reps
in  theories.
The starting point of the construction is a pair of
NIM-reps  of the  and the  theories
with the sets  and .(
This can be generalized to the case of NIM-reps not factorizable
into the  and the  parts.
) 
Then one can make a NIM-rep of the  theory in the following form
   _(; )  ^(; ) 
  = ()  ()   
    ^G _ ^^H _ ^   ,   (; )   , 
  (; )   .
Here,  and  are labels of the Cardy states and
the Ishibashi states of , respectively, and defined as
    &= (; )   
        ^G, ^H, 
        b ^G_(J) = b ^H_(J') 
        ((J, J') ()), 

&        (J ; J' ) = (; ) 
        ((J, J') ())  ,
 

    &= (; )   
        ^G, ^H, 
        b^G_(J) = b^H_(J')  
        ((J, J') ()), 

&        (J ; J' ) = (; ) 
        ((J, J') ())  .
 and  are the groups of the identification
currents for the Ishibashi states and the Cardy states, respectively,
  () &=


  (^G  ^H ) ,
   

  () &= / () ,
where  is the stabilizer for the action of the simple currents
on the Cardy states
(
In,  is denoted by .
) 
  = (J, J') 
   b^G_(J) = b^H_(J') 
                        (, ) ^G ^H  .
Let  be the NIM-rep matrix corresponding to
.
Then one can express the NIM-rep matrix 
of the  theory in terms of
 and  as follows
 (n _(; ) )_(; )  ^(=
         _(J, J') () 
         (n^G_)_J   ^         (n^H_)_J'   ^.
For the regular NIM-reps, 
one obtains  and
 coincides with .

In, the condition

is called the brane selection rule, while
 is called
the brane identification.
If there is no fixed point in the brane identification,
the matrix eq:finalpsi  yields a NIM-rep
 of the  theory.
If we have fixed points in the brane identification,
we have to resolve them in order to obtain a unitary .
This is the same situation as the field identification
fixed points.




Mutual consistency of twisted boundary conditions 

As we have seen in the previous section,
the problem of solving the Cardy conditions is equivalent with finding
an appropriate NIM-rep of the fusion algebra.
However, the number of solutions may be greater than one
and we may have several NIM-reps for one particular fusion algebra.
Although these different NIM-reps are in general considered to be
corresponding to different modular invariants,
it is possible that two or more NIM-reps coexist in the
same modular invariant and are compatible with each other.
This issue of mutual consistency of different NIM-reps
has been studied in (see also)
for the case of the boundary states twisted by an automorphism
of the chiral algebra.
We briefly review this in the following and discuss
its application to the case of coset models.


We begin with the relation of the twisted Ishibashi state

for  with the untwisted one
.
Introducing an orthonormal basis  of ,
the untwisted Ishibashi state can be written as
    = _ 
         _ _   .
One can construct the Ishibashi states for 
starting from .
Let  be a unitary operator mapping 
to ,
  :  __  ,   W_n  ^= (W_n ) ,   W _n  ^= W _n .
Then the twisted Ishibashi state 
can be written as
   _=  _= 1 
  = _  ( )      _   _   .
Actually, one can check that
this state satisfies the twisted gluing condition,
  ((W_n) - (-1)^h W _-n )  _  &=
  (W_n ^- (-1)^h W _-n )
    _= 1  

  &= (W_n - (-1)^h W _-n )  _= 1  

  &= 0 .
The normalization of  follows from that of 
and coincides with our convention eq:Ishibashinorm ,
    _  q^H_c     =   ^q^H_c     =   q^H_c     = __ () .
We will also need the overlap of the twisted Ishibashi state with
the untwisted one.
Since  couples  with ,
we have a non-vanishing overlap if and only if ,
    q^H_c    =   q^H_c    =  
   ^_()
  &if   , 

   0
  &otherwise  .
   Here  is the twining character   ^_() = __  q^L_0 - c 12   .
For the case of (untwisted) affine Lie algebras,
the twining character coincides with the ordinary character
of a twisted affine Lie algebra called the orbit Lie algebra.

In order to obtain the spectrum in the open string channel,
we need the modular transformation of the twining character.
Since the twining character appears in the overlap between twisted
and untwisted states, its modular transformation is written in terms
of the characters of the twisted chiral algebra .
Here we denote by  an algebra generated by the currents
with the twisted boundary condition .
Let  be the set of all the possible representations of
the twisted chiral algebra 
and  be
the corresponding character.
Then the modular transformation of the twining character can be
written as
 
  ^_(-1/) &= _    
  S ^(0) _    _  (/r)   (^), 

  _  (-1/) &= _^ 
  S ^(1) _     ^_ (/r)   (   ),
where  and  are
some unitary matrices.
We divide the argument of  by the order  of
the automorphism  so that  is expanded
in integer powers of .
The properties of  and  have been
investigated in.
In particular, it has been shown that 
is related with  via transposition,
 S ^(1) _    =
 _^-2  S ^(0) _   ,
where  is an appropriate phase factor.

If  is an (untwisted) affine Lie algebra  at level ,
the corresponding twisted chiral algebra  is the twisted
affine Lie algebra  at level  and
.

 
 
 
The modular transformation of the twisted affine Lie algebras.
 stands for the rank of the algebras. 

Since the modular transformation of the character of 
is expressed by the characters of another affine Lie algebra
 (see Table ),
the matrices  in eq:St  are nothing but
the modular transformation matrix between  and
,
(
This fact gives an explanation for the coincidence of the twining character
 with the ordinary character of the orbit Lie algebra.) 
for which
we can set  and obtain
.
In the following, we restrict ourselves to the case of 
and write  as ,
  S ^(0)  = S ^(1)  ^T S  .
The matrix  satisfies the following properties
  S  S ^&= 1,  

  (S  S ^T)_  &= C_  =  _  ,
  

  (S ^T S )_     &=
  C _     =
  _        (, ^,   ,    ),
where  and  are the charge-conjugation matrix
of  and , respectively.


We turn to the construction of the twisted Cardy states.
Suppose that we obtain the twisted Cardy states
 in the diagonal modular invariant,
    _= _^ 
  _   ^1 S_0    
   _.
For 
to be well-defined in the diagonal modular invariant,

has to be consistent with the regular Cardy states
.
From eqs.eq:twin eq:St , one can calculate
the overlap of the twisted states 
with the untwisted state ,
  0  q ^H_c    _=
  _^  _   ^
  ^_(-1/) =
  _^,      
  _   ^S _  
   _  (/r) .
Clearly, this amplitude is made to be well-defined if one sets
 or .
Here we take the latter choice ,
    _= _^ 
  S _     1 S_0    
   _(   ),
for which the overlap with  reads
  0  q ^H_c    _=
  _    
  (S ^T S )_   
  _  (/r) =
  _   (/r) .
The twisted Cardy states are therefore labeled by the representation
 of the twisted chiral algebra .

The twisted state  is characterized
by the property that
the open string spectrum eq:0t  between  
and  consists of  only.
This is completely parallel with Cardy's original construction of
the untwisted Cardy states:
 is determined so that
 holds
.
From this construction, Cardy has argued that the overlap
of the Cardy states can be expressed in terms of the fusion coefficients,
namely,
    q ^H_c     =
  _      _() .
Substituting  in the left-hand side,
one obtains the Verlinde formula eq:Verlinde .
We can proceed in the same way for the twisted states.
For simplicity, we restrict ourselves to the case of .(
For the case of , we have to introduce  twisted sectors in order
to describe the fusion rule of the twisted representations.) 
Then the counterpart of eq:boundaryfusion  can be written as
 
   _   q ^H_c     &=
  _          
  _  (/r) ,

   _   q ^H_c     _  &=
  _       
  _ () ,
where 
can be considered as describing the fusion rule
of the twisted representation with the ordinary one.
Substituting the expression eq:Cardy_t  for the twisted states,
we obtain a generalized Verlinde formula
        =
          =
  _^ 
  
  S _   S _   
  S_    S_0    .
Since the fusion coefficients take values in non-negative integers,
the above expression eq:boundaryfusion_t  for the overlaps
implies that the mutual consistency of the twisted states
eq:Cardy_t  with the regular states.

The action of the simple currents on the twisted Cardy states
eq:Cardy_t  can be described
in terms of the twisted chiral algebra .
In order to see this, consider the case of the affine Lie algebra 
and the diagram automorphism , for which
the coefficient  in the twisted Cardy states
is the modular transformation matrix between
the twisted affine Lie algebras  and 
(see Table ).
The sets, , of the labels of the Cardy states and the Ishibashi states,
respectively, read
 =   = P_+^k(^(r) ) ,  = ^P_+^k( ^(r) ) .
Here we used the equivalence of the twining character of 
and the ordinary character of the orbit Lie algebra 
to identify  with .
In this case, the action of the simple currents can be identified
with the diagram automorphisms of
 and , namely,
    = Aut (^(r) ) ,     Aut ( ^(r) ) ,
where we denote by 
the group of the diagram automorphisms of .
For  and ,
there is no nontrivial automorphism and .
For  and ,
there is an automorphism of order  and  
(see Fig. ).


 
The Dynkin diagrams of  (left) and
 (right). The arrows stand for the action of
the diagram automorphisms. 



Let us apply the foregoing discussion to the case of the  theory.
Suppose that
an automorphism  of the horizontal  Lie algebra 
leaves  invariant.
Then  induces an automorphism  of the  theory,
which acts on  as
    : (; ) (; ) ,
  (; )  .
A natural candidate for the corresponding NIM-rep of 
can be constructed
starting from the twisted Cardy states eq:Cardy_t  of
 and .
The formula eq:finalpsi  yields the following diagonalization
matrix
   _( ;  )  ^(; ) 
  = ()  ()   
    S ^G _   
    S ^H _      ,   ( ;  )   , 
  (; )   ,
where  and  are defined as
    &= ( ;  )   
           ^G,    ^H, 
        b ^G_  (J) = b ^H_  (J') 
        ((J, J') ()), 

&        (J  ; J'  ) = ( ;  ) 
        ((J, J') ())  ,


    &= (; )   
        ^G, , ^H, , 
        b^G_(J) = b^H_(J')  
        ((J, J') ()), 

&        (J ; J' ) = (; ) 
        ((J, J') ())  .
Since the spectrum  of the Ishibashi states consists of
the elements invariant under ,
one can expect that this NIM-rep describes the -twisted
Cardy states of .
As we shall see below, this is the case if  in
eq:psihat_twisted 
gives a well-defined NIM-rep.

We begin our discussion with the relation of the spectrum 
with the set
 of all the representations
fixed by ,
   ^   =
  (; )      (; ) = (; ).
Clearly,  is contained in ;
the converse is in general not true.
Actually, it is possible that  gives rise to
the same state as  due to the field identification
even if  (or ).
Therefore  does not
necessarily coincide with ;
rather a subset of  in general.
If  is a true subset of ,
we obtain several extra Ishibashi states.
This is a situation analogous to the case of orbifolds,
in which we may have some extra Ishibashi states from the twisted sectors.
These extra states
can be used to resolve the branes sitting at the fixed points
of the orbifold to yield fractional branes.
For the construction of the boundary states in the  theory,
the counterpart of the orbifold fixed points
is the brane identification fixed point,
and one can expect that the existence of the extra Ishibashi states
implies the appearance of the brane identification fixed points,
which are to be resolved by the extra states.
As we will see later, this is checked for the  diagonal coset.

In the rest of this section, we restrict ourselves to the case
of .
Then a -invariant
representation  has a representative
such that ,
and the twining character of  can be obtained
as the branching function of the twining character of ,
 
  ^G, _&=
  _^H,  
  ^  _(;)  ^H, _,
    ^G,  . 


Similarly, the branching rule for the twisted chiral algebra
can be written as 
  ^G _   &=
  _   ^H 
    _( ; )  ^H _  ,
       ^G  .
For an affine Lie algebra  and
its diagram automorphism  of order ,
the above equations can be regarded as the branching rule of
the orbit Lie algebra  and
the twisted Lie algebra , respectively.
The modular transformation of the twining character
 yields
, and vice versa,
 
  ^  _(; ) (-1/) &=
  _( ; )   
  S ^(0) _(;) ( ; ) 
  _( ; ) (/r) , 

  _( ; ) (-1/) &=
  _(;)   
  S ^(1) _( ; )(;) 
  ^  _(; ) (/r) .
From the branching rules eq:cosettwining ,
one can express these modular transformation matrices
in terms of  and  in eq:St ,
 
  S ^(0) _(;) ( ; )  &=
  ()  S ^G(0) _  
                 S ^H(0) _    , 

  S ^(1) _( ; )(;)  &=
  ()  S ^G(1) _   
                 S ^H(1) _     ,
where the factors, , , arise
from rewriting the sum over  and , respectively,
 
  _( ;  )    &     1 ()  
     _( ,  )  ^G  ^H 
     1 ()   _(J, J') () 
            b ^G_  (J) b ^H_  (J')^-1 , 

  _(; )    &     1 ()  
     _(, ) ^G,  ^H,  
     1 ()   _(J, J') () 
            b^G_ (J) b^H_ (J')^-1  .
The expression eq:St_coset  together with
the relation eq:S0S1  between  and 
implies that the order of the identification groups for  and 
should take the same value ,
  ()  = ()  N .
Two modular transformation matrices in eq:St_coset 
are therefore related with each other via transposition,
  S ^(0) _(;) ( ; )  =
  S ^(1) _( ; ) (;)  =
  N S ^G _  
                 S ^H _    ,
where we used the relation eq:assumeStilde .

Clearly, the above matrix coincides with the diagonalization matrix
eq:psihat_twisted  constructed from the twisted NIM-reps
of  and .
Hence the states 
defined in eq:psihat_twisted  are actually
the twisted Cardy states eq:Cardy_t  for the automorphism
 of the  theory, and
the set  of the labels for the Cardy states can be identified
with those for the branching functions eq:cosettwining2 
of the twisted chiral algebra.

Applying the argument for the generic twisted states
to the present case, we can confirm
that the twisted states

are consistent with the regular states
.
In particular, the overlaps can be expressed in exactly
the same manner as eq.eq:Verlinde_t ,
 

  ( ; ) 
     q ^H_c  ( ; )  &=
  _( '; ')   
  N  _( ; ) (;) 
       ^( '; ') 
  _( '; ') (/r) ,

  ( ; ) 
     q ^H_c 
  ( ' ; ' ) 
  &=
  _(;)   
  N  _( ; )( '; ') 
       ^(;) 
  _(;) () .
The fusion coefficients for the twisted representations
take the form
 N  _(; ) ( ;  ) 
       ^( '; ')  &=
 _(;)   
     
        S _(;)(;) 
        S _( ;  )(;) 
        S _( ';  ')(;)   
        S _(0;0)(;)   

  &= _(, ) ^G,  ^H,  
     _(J, J') () 
            b^G_ (J) b^H_ (J')^-1 
     
        S^G_ 
        S ^G_  
        S ^G_ '    
        S^G_0   
     
        S^H_  
        S ^H_    
        S ^H_ '   
        S^H_0     

  &=       _(J, J') () 
         N ^G_J   ^ ' 
         N ^H_J'   ^ '  ,
where we used the formula eq:sumEhat 
and the relation eq:N .
One can see that this expression for the overlaps
of the twisted Cardy states coincides with
the formula eq:finalNIM  for generic NIM-reps of the  theory.




Boundary states in  diagonal coset theory 

The diagonal coset theory 
has the central charge  and is equivalent
to the orbifold  at the radius .

In this section, we apply the method given in the previous sections
to this particular model to construct the twisted Cardy states
following from the diagram automorphisms of .
We will compare the result with the boundary states of 
in the next section.


Preliminaries 


We denote by  the set of all the integrable representations of
.
For , we obtain
 
  _1 &= _0, _1, _n-1 , _n  , 

  _2 &= 2_0, 2_1, 2_n-1 , 2_n, 

  &         _0 + _n-1 ,  _0 + _n ,
        _1 + _n-1 ,  _1 + _n ,
        _j (j=1,2,,n-1) ,
where
 is the -th fundamental weight of the affine 
and  are defined as
 
The simple current group of  consists of four elements
  = J_O = k _0 ,  J_V = k _1,
         J_C = k _n-1 , J_S = k _n   .
For even ,  is factorized as
  = J_O, J_C J_O, J_S  _2 _2
  (n : even ),
while, for odd ,  is a cyclic group 
  = J_O, J_S, J_V = (J_S)^2, J_C = (J_S)^3  _4
  (n : odd ) .
The modular transformation matrices together with the action of the
simple currents are found in Appendix .

One can construct the primary fields of 
by applying the selection rule and the field identification
to .
Since we are considering the diagonal embedding
,
the identification currents are of the form 
and  is isomorphic to .
There is no fixed points in the field identification and we have

 primary fields.
We list the resulting spectrum in Table ,
in which each field is denoted by a single symbol.

Our notation is the same as that of.

Construction of the twisted Cardy states 

As we have seen in the previous sections,
we can construct the Cardy states, or NIM-reps, of the  theory starting
from those of the  and  theories.
By taking non-trivial NIM-reps of  or , one could in general
obtain a non-trivial NIM-rep of , besides the regular one.
In particular, the Cardy states twisted by an automorphism
of the  chiral algebra follow from those of the  and  theories.
As is argued in Section , these twisted states
are consistent with the regular ones
and can be considered as the states in the diagonal modular invariant.

For the  diagonal coset theory, the relevant chiral algebras are
 and .
There are three types of automorphisms available
for twisting the boundary condition of the coset theory:
the order- automorphism  of ,
the order- automorphism  of  and
the permutation automorphism  of .
As we will see below, we can obtain twisted states for 
and  by applying the construction of the previous sections.
For the permutation automorphism , however,
the resulting NIM-rep suffers from the brane identification fixed points,
and we obtain the known NIM-reps after the resolution of the fixed points.


-automorphism of  

The order- automorphism  of  exchanges
two short legs of the Dynkin diagram of ,
  _2 : _n-1  _n ,              _i _i  (i n-1, n) .
From this automorphism, one obtains an automorphism
 of ,
which clearly makes invariant 
and yields an automorphism  of the coset theory,
   _2 : (_1, _2; )                    (_2 _1, _2 _2; _2 ) ,   (_1, _2; )  .
Using the notation in Table , the action of 
can be written as
   _2 : u_, _, _r, _j, _j                    u_, _, _r, _1-j , _1-j  .
The building blocks of the construction are the twisted NIM-rep
of  and .
As is explained in Section (in particular eq.eq:Cardy_t ),
the diagonalization matrix of the twisted NIM-rep is given by
the modular transformation matrix of the twisted chiral algebra,
which is  in the present case.
We list the necessary facts about  in Appendix .

The NIM-rep for  is obtained from
the formula eq:psihat_twisted  by taking
 and
, where  stands for
the modular transformation matrix of  at level .
The spectrum  of the Ishibashi states follows from
the formula eq:E_twisted ,
    = (_0, ; )     
        ^_2 _1, ^_2 _2 
  = u_, _r (r = 1,2,, n-1),
where we denote by  the set of the -invariant
representations of .
One can easily confirm from the map eq:omega2 
that  coincides with the set 
of all the -invariant representations and that
there is no extra Ishibashi states.

The Cardy states
are labeled by the representations of .
The set  of the Cardy states
follows from the formula eq:V_twisted ,
    &= ( _1,  _2;  )   
         _1,  _2  _1;
           _2; 
        b _ _1  b _ _2 
        = b _  ;   

&        (J  _1, J  _2; J  )
         = ( _1, _2;  ) 
        ((J, J, J) ())  ,
where we denote by  the set of the integrable representations
of  at level .
The identification current groups,  and , can
be regarded as the group of the diagram automorphisms
of  and , respectively.
 in eq:Dn2V_temp  is the monodromy charge for
the action of  (see Appendix ),
whereas  stands for the diagram automorphism of .
Since there is no fixed points in , we have also
no fixed points in the brane identification.
Consequently, one can identify  with the set of
the labels for branching functions of
,
which consists of the following elements
    =  ( _0,  _0;  _r) 
   (r = 0,1,, n-1),
   ( _0,  _n-1 ;
     _0 +  _n-1 )  .
Here  are the fundamental weights of 
and  are defined in Appendix .
Putting these things together,
the diagonalization matrix eq:psihat_twisted  can be written
as follows,
  ^ _2   =
     1 2n                
We have  twisted Cardy states for .
The overlaps of these states with the regular ones
are expanded into the branching functions of  (See
Appendix  for the explicit form of the branching functions.)
For example, the overlap of the twisted state

with the regular state  can be written as
  ( _0, _0; _r) 
  q ^H_c  u_+  =
  _( _0, _0; _r) (/2),
where
 is
the branching function of
.


-automorphism of  

The case of the order-3 automorphism  of 
can be treated in the same way as .
The automorphism  of  permutes
three legs of the Dynkin diagram of ,
  _3 : _1 _3 _4
                       _1 .
This induces an automorphism of the coset theory, which we denote by
,
   _3 : (_1, _2; )                    (_3 _1, _3 _2; _3 ) ,   (_1, _2; )  .
There are  representations for the  coset theory.
Using the notation in Table , the action of 
can be written as
   _3 :
  
   
     u_+; & _2; 

     u_-, & _+, & _-; 

     _1,  & _0, & _1; 

     _3,  & _0,   & _1
  
       
   
     u_+; & _2; 

     _+, & _-, & u_-; 

     _0, & _1, & _1; 

     _0,   & _1 ,  & _3
   .
One can see that there are three orbits of length  together with
two fixed points .

The twisted NIM-rep for  is given by
the modular transformation matrix of the twisted chiral algebra .
We list the necessary facts about  in Appendix .
We can obtain the NIM-rep for  of the coset theory
applying the formula eq:psihat_twisted  to
 and
.
Here  stands for
the modular transformation matrix of  at level .
The spectrum  of the Ishibashi states follows from
the formula eq:E_twisted ,
    = (_0, ; )     
        ^_3 _1, ^_3 _2 
  = u_+, _2  ,
where we denote by  the set of the -invariant
representations of .
One can see that
 coincides with the set 
of all the -invariant representations.

The Cardy states
are labeled by the representations of .
Since there is no non-trivial diagram automorphism for ,
we have no non-trivial identification currents in the present case,
i.e. ,
.
Then the formula eq:V_twisted  yields the set 
in the form
    &= ( _1,  _2;  )   
         _1,  _2  _1;
           _2  =
  ( _0,  _0; 2  _0),
    ( _0,  _0;  _1) ,
where we denote by  the set of the integrable representations
of  at level  and
by  the fundamental weights of .
 can be regarded as the set of
the labels for the branching functions of
.
The diagonalization matrix eq:psihat_twisted  can be written
as follows,
  ^ _3  =
     1 2                
We have two twisted Cardy states for .
The overlaps of these states with the regular ones
are expanded into the branching functions of 
in the manner parallel to the case of .


Permutation automorphism of  

The permutation automorphism  acts on
 as the exchange of two  factors.
Clearly,  leaves invariant 
and induces an automorphism  of the coset theory,
    : (_1, _2; ) (_2, _1; ) ,
  (_1, _2; )  .
In order to obtain the corresponding NIM-rep of the coset theory,
we need to know the NIM-rep of 
for the boundary condition twisted by the automorphism .
This problem of finding a NIM-rep for the permutation automorphism
of tensor product theories has been solved in,
which we briefly review.

Suppose that we have a NIM-rep

of a fusion algebra  with the fusion coefficients
.
Let 
be the corresponding diagonalization matrix,
.
Then the problem is to find a NIM-rep 
for the tensor product algebra  with the spectrum
,
which consists of the elements fixed by the permutation
.
This is solved by setting
  n^_(, )  = n_n_,
where the product in the right-hand side is taken as
a  matrix.
Since  form a NIM-rep of ,
 also has entries with non-negative integers.
Hence what we have to do is to check that  satisfy
the fusion algebra ,
which can be shown as follows,
  n^_(, )  n^_(   = (n_n_) (n_n_  &= (n_n_(n_  n_

  &= _   n_    _   n_

  &= _( 
      
    n^_(.
Here we used the fact that the fusion algebra is commutative
to change the order of the product.
The diagonalization matrix  for  is given by
, which follows immediately
from the definition eq:npi  of ,
  (n^_(, ) )_  ^  = (n_n_)_ ^  &= (^()  ^      ^()  ^)_  ^

  &= _  _ ^          ^() _^() _          _ ^  

  &= _  _ ^          ^(, ) _(, ) 
          _ ^  .
This calculation also shows that the spectrum for  consists
of only the elements 
fixed by the permutation .
Hence  defined in eq:npi  is actually a NIM-rep
of  with the spectrum .(
In, only the case of the regular NIM-rep  for 
is considered. Our argument provides its generalization to
a generic NIM-rep .
) 
Note that the Cardy states for  are also labeled by  for .

The action of the simple currents eq:Gpsi 
on the permutation NIM-rep  follows from that on .
First, the simple current group 
for the Ishibashi states is the diagonal subgroup
of ,
  J : (, ) (J, J) , J   ,
which acts on  as
  ^ _  ^(J, J) 
  = _  ^J 
  = b _ (J) _  ^ 
  = b _ (J) ^ _  ^(, )  .
The action on the Cardy states is given by
,
  ^ _  ^(,)  b_(, ) ((J,J'))
  = ^ _  ^(,)  b_ (J) b_ (J')
  = _  ^  b_ (J J')
  = _J J'   ^ 
  = ^ _J J'   ^(,) ,
where we used the fact that  is a representation
of the simple current group.
This action has a non-trivial stabilizer,
  ^  &= (J,J')     
  b_(J J') = 1  

  &= (J,J')     
  J J' = 1  

  &  ,
and the simple current group  for the Cardy states
is defined as
  ^  =     / ^ 
    .
The above construction of the permutation NIM-rep
is easily generalized to the case of
tensor products with more than two factors.
Namely, a NIM-rep corresponding to the permutation
automorphism  is obtained as
  n^__1 _2 _n  =
  n__1  n__2  n__n  .
The diagonalization matrix is again given by that for .

Let us apply the above construction
to the  part of the coset theory.
To make the discussion concrete,
we consider only the case of , although
the case of  can be treated in the same way.

The building blocks of the construction are the permutation NIM-rep
eq:npi  for  and
the regular NIM-rep for ,
from which one can obtain a NIM-rep eq:finalpsi 
of the coset theory.
Since the spectrum of the permutation NIM-rep consists
of the representations of the form
,
the spectrum eq:cosetspec  of the Ishibashi states
reads
    = (_0, _0; )  
  = u_+, u_-, _+, _-, _2  .
We therefore obtain five Ishibashi states.
The Cardy states of the permutation NIM-rep is also labeled by
.
Applying the formula eq:cosetboundary , one obtains
    = (; )   
        _1, _2, 
        b_(J) = b_(J), 
        (J^2 ; J ) = (; ) 
        (J )  ,
where we used the action of the simple currents eq:sconVpi 
on the permutation NIM-rep.
Using  for ,
one obtains  explicitly,
    = 
   (_0; 2 _0)_4 ,
   (_0;   _2)_1 ,
   (_1; _0 + _1)_2 ,
   (_3; _0 + _3)_2 ,
   (_4; _0 + _4)_2 .
The subscript in this equation stands for the length of
the brane identification orbit
  (; J )  J ,
which is equal to  if there is no fixed point.
One can see that all the elements other than 
are fixed points of the brane identification,
and we have to resolve them to obtain a consistent NIM-rep of
the coset theory.
The degeneracy of the fixed points are given by the ratio
of the orbit length to the order of the identification current group.
After resolving them, the number of the Cardy states
would therefore be
.
Since there are only five Ishibashi states eq:Epi_temp  in ,
we have to find  states besides those in 
for the resolution of the fixed points.
One can find these states by considering the action eq:pihat 
of  on .
Actually, one can see that not only the states in  but
all the elements in  are invariant under the action of
 due to the field identification.
Eventually, we obtain  extra Ishibashi states to resolve the fixed
points in .
The spectrum of the resolved NIM-rep
is however the same as that of the regular one.
In fact, one can show that
the diagonalization matrix eq:finalpsi  obtained from the permutation
NIM-rep is considered to be the regular NIM-rep after
appropriately resolving the fixed points.

One can repeat the same analysis for the case of .
There are also the brane identification fixed points.
After the resolution of them, one again finds nothing new,
namely, the regular NIM-rep for even  and
the -twisted NIM-rep for odd .




Relation with orbifold theories 

The diagonal coset theory

has the central charge , where
 
is the central charge of the  WZW model at level .
Therefore this model should belong to the class of rational CFTs
with , which consists of
the circle theory  with the radius ,
(
We set .) 
its  orbifold  and
three exceptional models .
(We restrict ourselves to the case of
the diagonal modular invariants.) 
Actually, by comparing the spectrum,
the  diagonal coset theory is shown to be equivalent
with the orbifold theory at 
 
where we introduced the normalized radius 
so that the self-dual point corresponds to .

In this section, we use this equivalence of the  coset theory
with the orbifold to check our calculation
for the twisted Cardy states in the coset theory.(
Boundary states in the  models have been studied
from the RCFT point of view also in.) 
Namely, we shall find that both of the  and the  Cardy states
have their counterpart in the orbifold theory.
The  states as well as the regular ones
are realized by the usual Neumann and Dirichlet states of the orbifold.
On the other hand, one can not find the  states
within the Neumann and Dirichlet states; rather the  states
correspond to the conformal boundary states of the orbifold,
which generalize those of  constructed in
.
(The construction of the conformal boundary states
for the orbifold (at ) is found in Appendix .)
This fact assures the validity of our calculation, in particular,
the mutual consistency of the twisted states with the regular ones.


Regular Cardy states 

We begin with rewriting the regular Cardy states of the coset theory
in terms of the orbifold.
We review some basic facts about the boundary states in the orbifold
in Appendix .

Since the Cardy states are expressed as linear combinations of
the Ishibashi states, we need to know
the expression of the Ishibashi states in the orbifold theory.
From the explicit form of the characters of the  coset theory
(see Appendix ),
we can identify the corresponding Ishibashi states in
the orbifold at  as follows,
   u_      &=
     1 2 _m  ((2n m) (2m)  ),

   _   &=
     1 2 _m  ((n(2m+1)) i^n(2m+1) ),

   _s      &=
     1 2  _m  ((2nm+s) +(2nm-s) ),

   _j    &=
     1 22  
     [_T(0) +_T(0) 
      +i^n(-1)^j (_T() +_T() ) ],

   _j      &=
     1 22  
     [_T(0) -_T(0) 
      +i^n(-1)^j (_T() -_T() ) ] .
See Appendix for our notation of the Ishibashi states in .
Then it is straightforward to express the regular Cardy states

 in terms of the boundary states
of the orbifold,
   u_     &= [0]; _O ,    _   = []; _O ,    _s     = [s n ] _O , 

   _j  &= [j];+ _O ,   _j     = [j];- _O .
To be precise, we can multiply each Ishibashi state of the orbifold
by some phases in our dictionary eq:Ishibashi_relation 
without changing the normalization.
We have fixed this ambiguity by requiring that
the regular state  corresponds to one of the fractional
D-particle  sitting at .


Twisted Cardy states 

 states 

We can identify the  twisted Cardy states of
the  coset theory with the boundary states
of the orbifold in the same way as the regular ones.
To obtain the expression
of the  twisted Ishibashi states in the orbifold theory,
we have two types of conditions.
The first one is that
the overlap of the twisted states with themselves should yield
the ordinary character of the coset theory,
which is the same condition as we used in deriving
eq.eq:Ishibashi_relation .
The second is that the overlap with the regular states should be
equal to the twining character for the  automorphism,
which is the branching function of .
See Appendix  for their explicit form.
The  twisted Ishibashi states can be determined from these
two conditions together with our expression eq:Ishibashi_relation 
for the regular states.
The result is as follows,
    u_ ^_2   &=
    1 2  _m  (-1)^m ((2nm) (2m) ) ,

    _s ^_2  &=
    1 2   _m  (-1)^m
      ((2nm+s) +(2nm-s) ) .
Then one finds that
the  twisted Cardy states eq:psihat_omega2 
can be written in the form
  ( _0, _0; _s)  =
        [1 n (s + 1 2 )] _O ,   ( _0, _n-1 ;
         _0+ _n-1 )  =
        [ 2 ] _O .
Since the right-hand side of these equations coincide with
the usual boundary states of the orbifold,
the mutual consistency of the  states with the regular
ones is manifest.

 states 

For , we have the  twisted Cardy states.
As we will see shortly, one can not express the  states
within the usual Neumann and Dirichlet states of the orbifold
at , and we are led to introduce the conformal
boundary states of the orbifold in order to express the  states.

As we have seen in the last section,
there are two  Cardy states eq:psihat_omega3 .
For convenience, we introduce a short-hand notation for them,
  0 __3  =
  ( _0,  _0; 2 _0)  ,   1 __3  =
  ( _0,  _0;  _1)  .
  Let us consider
the overlap of these states with the regular state ,
  u_  q ^H_c  0 __3  &=
  1 (q)  _N   q^(N+1 6 )^2  , 

  u_  q ^H_c  1 __3  &=
  1 (q)  _N   q^(N+1 3 )^2  ,
which are readily obtained from the explicit form of these states.
From this expression, one can conclude that
the  states are not realized by either the Dirichlet or the Neumann
states.
In order to see this,
note that the spectrum eq:Ehat_omega3  of
the -invariant Ishibashi states consists of two states
.
The orbifold expression eq:Ishibashi_relation  of the regular
Ishibashi states shows that these two states ,
do not contain the fields in the twisted sectors of the orbifold.
Therefore the  Cardy states eq:Z3short  should consist of
only the fields in the untwisted sector, and
only the untwisted sector part of ,
which is given by ,
contributes in the overlap eq:Z3overlap .
However,
from Appendix , we find that any states of the Dirichlet
or the Neumann types do not have the overlap
of the form eq:Z3overlap  with .
Actually, the overlap of 
with non-fractional states takes the form
  u_+  q ^H_c  [x] _O  &=
  1 (q)  _N   q^4(N+x 2 )^2  , 

  u_+  q ^H_c  [] _O  &=
  1 (q)  _N   q^(N+1 4 )^2  ,
which is clearly different from that in eq:Z3overlap .
Therefore we can conclude that the  states eq:Z3short 
are not realized within the usual states of the orbifold,
which preserve the chiral algebra  of .
We need states other than those keeping  for
describing the  Cardy states in the orbifold.
Actually, in the orbifold, there exist many boundary states
besides those of the Neumann and the Dirichlet types.
This can be understood from the fact that,
in order to obtain a boundary CFT, it may be enough to require
that only the Virasoro algebra, rather than its extension,
is preserved at the boundaries.
In general, finding the conformal boundary states
that preserve only the Virasoro algebra is a difficult task
since a CFT is irrational with respect to the Virasoro algebra for .
For , however, this problem is within the reach of the known techniques
and has been solved for the case of (see also).
This construction of the conformal boundary states
is readily generalized to the orbifold .
We report the detail of the construction in Appendix for the case of .

The construction of the conformal boundary states is
based on the fact that the CFT for  at  is equivalent
with the  WZW model at level 1.
The conformal boundary states of  at  are therefore
parametrized by .
Since  at  can be considered
as an orbifold of the  WZW model by the discrete subgroup
 of ,(
To be precise, the dihedral group  is a subgroup of
, where  is the center of
.
As a subgroup of , we should consider
the binary dihedral group .) 
the conformal boundary states of  are also parametrized
by , which we denote by 
(see Appendix  for detail).
One can find the  Cardy states eq:Z3short  within these
conformal boundary states of .
The result is as follows,(
One can also realize the  states by setting
.
These two choices for  correspond to the twist 
by  and by .) 
  &0 __3  = g _,   1 __3  = -g _,  

  &g= 1 2  ( 1 + _1 + _2 + _3) =
    1 2    ,
where  form the dihedral group
.
With this choice, one can show that the overlap eq:Z3overlap 
is reproduced by using the formula
eq:conformal_overlap  in Appendix .
Moreover, the overlap with the  states themselves
   __3 0  q ^H_c  0 __3  &=
   __3 1  q ^H_c  1 __3   =
  1 (q) ( _N   q^N^2  +
                   3 _N   q^(N + 1 4 )^2  ) , 

   __3 0  q ^H_c  1 __3   &=
  1 (q) ( _N   q^(N+1 2 )^2  +
                   3 _N   q^(N + 1 4 )^2  ) ,
can also be reproduced from our solution eq:Z3answer .
Hence we can conclude that the  Cardy states of the  coset theory
are realized by the conformal boundary states of the orbifold.
This fact again shows the validity of our argument about the mutual consistency
of the Cardy states.


Discussions 

In this paper, we have argued the mutual consistency of the twisted
boundary states with the untwisted ones in coset CFTs.
We have constructed explicitly 
the twisted Cardy states of the coset theory and 
have shown that they have well-defined overlaps with the untwisted
states. 
We have also pointed out that the overlap of the twisted states
can be described in terms of the branching functions
of twisted affine Lie algebras. 
As a check of our argument,
we have given a detailed study of the twisted boundary states in
the  diagonal coset theory
and have confirmed
their consistency through the equivalence with the orbifold . 
As a by-product, we have found a new type of boundary states in
, which break  but 
preserve the Virasoro algebra.

A natural problem related with our result is the issue of the mutual
consistency of NIM-reps other than those originating from
the automorphisms of the chiral algebra. 
Actually, there exists many non-trivial NIM-reps for  
at level 2 and
we can construct the corresponding NIM-reps of the diagonal coset theory
combining them with the NIM-rep of .
It is interesting to see whether these NIM-reps are non-trivial or not.
If non-trivial, it would be
worth studying about their consistency with the regular one. 

Our construction of the twisted Cardy states for the triality
of  exhibits that 
the technique of RCFTs can be used for studying the conformal boundary
states in the  models.
This may be extended to the case of  by considering
 and its realization by a -dimensional torus .
The role of the Virasoro algebra is taken over by the  algebra
and we should consider the  boundary states instead of the conformal
ones.
It would be interesting to find an appropriate realization of 
as a RCFT equipped with automorphisms and observe 
whether the corresponding twisted boundary states yield the  states.

          _n-2 , _n-1 , _n )          (_1, _0, _2, ,
          _n-2 , _n , _n-1 ) , 

  &J_S : (_0, _1, _2, ,

The monodromy charge  for  is a function of
the conjugacy class of  and written as
  b_(J) =    
which is nothing but the character table of .

 

The modular transformation of the characters of
the twisted affine Lie algebra  gives rise to
those of , and vice versa.
Since the twining characters of  for the  automorphism
 coincide with the ordinary characters
of  at level ,
we can label the integrable representations of 
by the -invariant representations of ,
which form the set .
We therefore use  instead of 
and regard the modular transformation matrix 
for 
as a matrix between 
and .

 

There are two integrable representations for ,

   2_0, 2_1, _j  (j = 1,2,,n-1)  ,
where  are defined as
 
The modular transformation matrix reads
  1 2n        

simple currents 

For the modular transformation matrix

,
we have two types of actions of simple currents
since two sets,  and , are distinct.
The action on  is caused by the diagram automorphism
of  (see Fig. ),
which we denote by ,
  J  :  _j  _n-1-j  ,   J ^2 = 1 .
The action on  originates from the diagram automorphism
of  and is of order .
Since , this action can be realized
by an element of the simple current group  for .
Among four elements of , only  (besides )
leaves  invariant.
The action on  is therefore caused by .
Under these actions of simple currents,
 transforms as follows 
  S _J     &=
  S _    b_(J_S) , 

  S _ J_V  &=
  b _   S _    ,
where  is the monodromy charge eq:bD1  for 
and  is defined as
  b _   = (-1)^ _n-1   .
Here  is the Dynkin label of .
For example,
 for only
 in 
and
 in .

 

For , besides the  automorphism ,
we have an automorphism  of order 
which yields the twisted affine Lie algebra .
In the same way as the  case,
we can label the integrable representations of 
also by the -invariant representations of ,
which form the set .
Namely,
we have an isomorphism
.
Although the modular transformation of the characters of
 gives rise to those of  itself,
it is convenient for describing the twisted Cardy states
to regard the modular transformation matrix  for 
as a matrix between  and .

 

There is only one integrable representation for ,
   ^3_1   &=  _0  , 

  ^_3 _1  &= _1    _3 =  =
   _0  ,
where

are the fundamental weights of .

 

There are two integrable representations for ,
   ^3_2   &=  2 _0,  _1  , 

  ^_3 _2  &= _2    =  =
   2_0, _2  .
The modular transformation matrix reads
  1 2        
Since there is no diagram automorphism for ,
the simple current group for  is trivial.


Characters of
 

Ordinary characters 

There are  independent representations
in the branching of  into 
as is shown in Table .
The corresponding branching functions are
determined by decomposing the product of
characters of  into those of 
 (see 13.15 in):
  u_(q) &= 1 (q)  1 2  (
  _N   q^n N^2  _N   (-1)^N q^N^2  ), 

  _(q) &= 1 (q)  1 2 
  _N   q^n (N+1 2 )^2 , 

  _r(q) &= 1 (q) 
  _N   q^n (N+r 2n )^2  (r = 1, 2,,n-1), 

  _j(q) &= 1 (q) 
  _N   q^4 (N+1 8 )^2  (j = 0,1), 

  _j(q) &= 1 (q) 
  _N   q^4 (N+3 8 )^2  (j = 0,1) .
Here
we denote the branching functions by the same symbol as the corresponding
representations, e.g. ,
 stands for .

Twining characters 

-automorphism 

The -automorphism  of  yields
an automorphism  of the diagonal coset
,
which acts on the representations as
   _2 : (_1, _2; )                  (_2  _1, _2  _2; _2  ) .
There are  representations invariant under ,
which form the set ,
   ^ _2  = u_, _r  (r = 1,2,,n-1)
    .
Note that all the elements of  can be written
in the form
.
Hence the twining characters for the coset theory
can be determined from the following equations
  ^_2 __0  ^_2 _  =
  _^ _2 _(_0, ; )  ^_2 _,
where  is the twining character of .
Since  coincides
with the ordinary character of ,
one can regard the above equation as the branching rule of

and 
as the corresponding branching function,
which can be obtained in the same way as .
The result is written as follows,
  u^_2 _(q)  &^ _2 _u_ (q) =
  1 (q)  1 2  (
  _N   (-1)^N q^n N^2 
  _N   (-1)^N q^N^2  ), 

  ^_2 _r(q) &^ _2 __r (q) =
  1 (q) 
  _N   (-1)^N q^n (N+r 2n )^2  (r = 1, 2,,n-1).
-automorphism 

The case of the -automorphism  for 
can be treated in exactly the same way as the  case
discussed above.
We denote by  the associated automorphism
of the  diagonal coset theory.
Among  representations in ,
only two of them are invariant under ,
   ^ _3  = u_+, _2 
    .
The corresponding twining characters of the coset theory
can be obtained as the branching function of
.
The result is written as follows,
  u^_3 _+ (q)  &^ _3 _u_+ (q) =
  1 (q) 
  _N   e^2i 3 N  q^N^2  , 

  ^_3 _2(q) &^ _3 __2 (q) =
  1 (q) 
  _N + 1 2   e^2i 3 N  q^N^2  .
Characters of the twisted chiral algebra 



The characters of the twisted chiral algebra
for the -automorphism 
is given by the branching functions of
,
which are determined by
  _ _0  _   =
  _   _( _0,  ;  ) 
                     _   ,
where
.
There are  branching functions and the result is written as follows,
  _( _0,  _0;  _j) (q)
  & =  1 (q^2) 
  _N   q^2 n (N + 1 2n (j + 1 2 ))^2 
  (j = 0,1,, n-1) ,

  _( _0,  _n-1 ;
          _0 +  _n-1 ) (q)
  & =  1 (q^2) 
  _N   q^2 (N + 1 4 )^2  ,
where  are the integrable representations for 
defined in eq.eq:lambdatilde .


Boundary states in the orbifold  

 

The circle  is expressed by a free boson ,
(We set .) 
 
Let  be the radius of .
We also introduce the normalized radius
  r R = R 2  ,
in which the self-dual point corresponds to .
Then the spectrum of the left and right momenta  is written as
  p_L &= n R +mR 2 
       = 1 2   (n r  + m r ), 

  p_R &= n R -mR 2 
       = 1 2   (n r  - m r ) ,
where  and  stand for the momentum and
the winding number of the string, respectively.

The Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are expressed on
the modes as(
The zero modes are defined as  and .) 
 
The Ishibashi states for these boundary conditions read
 
where  is the ground state with
momentum  and winding number .
The overlaps of these states take the form
  (n)  q ^H_c  (n')  &=
    _n,n'  q ^n^2 4 r^2   (q)  ,

  (m)  q ^H_c  (m')  &=
    _m,m'  q ^m^2 r^2 4   (q)  ,

  (n)  q ^H_c  (m)  &=
    _n,0  _m,0  1 (q ) 
    _NZ (-1)^N q ^N^2 ,
where  is Dedekind's eta function and

is the closed string Hamiltonian.
Then one can write the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary states
in the form
  [x]       &= 2^-1/4  r^-1/2 
     _n   e^-i n x  (n) ,      0 x < 2, 

  []  &= 2^-1/4  r^1/2 
     _m   e^-i m   (m) ,      0 < 2.

 corresponds to a D0-brane sitting at 
while  is a D1-brane
with the Wilson line .
One can calculate the overlaps of these states from those of the Ishibashi
states,
  [x]  q ^H_c  [x']  &=
    1 (q)  _N   q^r^2(N + x-x' 2 )^2  

  []  q ^H_c  [&=
    1 (q)  _N  
    q^1 r^2 (N + 2 )^2  

  [x]  q ^H_c  []  &=
    1 (q)  _N   q^(N + 1 4 )^2  .

 

The boundary states of the orbifold  follow from
those of  by the standard procedure,
  [x] _O  &=
    1 2  ([x] +[-x] ),
    x 0, , 

  [] _O  &=
    1 2  ([] +[-] ),
    0, .
The fixed points of the  action 
can be resolved taking into account the Ishibashi states
from the twisted sectors,
   [0]; _O    &=
     1 2  [0]  2^-1/4  _T(0) ,

   []; _O  &=
     1 2  []  2^-1/4  _T() ,

   [0]; _O    &=
     1 2  [0] 
     2^-1/4  1 2   (_T(0) +_T() ),

   []; _O  &=
     1 2  [] 
     2^-1/4  1 2   (_T(0) -_T() ).
Here we introduced four Ishibashi states associated with
the fixed points ,
   _T(x)  &=
      [
       _N = 1 2 , 3 2 ,  
       1 N a_-N a _-N 
          ] x _T,

  _T(x)  &=
      [
       -_N = 1 2 , 3 2 ,  
        1 N a_-N a _-N 
          ] x _T,
where 
are the ground states of the twisted sectors.
The overlaps of these states read
   _T(x)  q ^H_c  _T(x')  &=
   _T(x)  q ^H_c  _T(x')   =
     _x,x' 
     1 (q ) 
     _N   q ^(N+1 4 )^2  , 

   _T(x)  q ^H_c  _T(x') 
   &=
     _x,x'  1 (q ) 
     _N   (-1)^N q ^(N + 1 4 )^2  .

We denote by  the Ishibashi states for

with .
 is normalized as follows,
  j;m,n  q^H_c  j';m',n'  =
  _jj'  _mm'  _nn'  _j(q),   _j(q) = 1 (q)  (q^j^2  - q^(j+1)^2 ) .
The  Ishibashi states  for  are
expressed as
  (n)  &= _j n  2  
                  j; n 2 , n 2   , 

  (m)  &= _j m  2   (-1)^j-m 2  
                  j; m 2 , -m 2   .
Since  at  is equivalent with the  WZW model at level 1,
the conformal boundary states at  are parametrized
by ,
  g  = 2^-1/4  _j,m,n  D^j _m,n (g) j; m,n  .
The overlap of these states reads
  g_1  q ^H_c  g_2  =
  1 (q)  _n   q^(n +  2 )^2  ,
where  is determined by the trace in the fundamental representation
of ,
  _j=1 2   (g_1^g_2) = 2 .
Among these conformal boundary states,
we can identify the Dirichlet and the Neumann states,
  []  &=
  2^-1/4  _n   e^-in   (n)  

  &=
  2^-1/4  _n   e^-in  
  _j n  2  
                  j; n 2 , n 2   =
  g = (
   
           )  , 

  []  &=
  2^-1/4  _m   e^-im   (m)  

  &=
  2^-1/4  _m   e^-im  
  _j m  2   (-1)^j-m 2  
                  j; m 2 , -m 2   =
  g = (
   
           )   .
Conformal boundary states in  

We can construct the conformal boundary states of the orbifold
 at the rational radii starting from those of .
Here we report only the case of . The case of 
can be treated in the similar way.

The orbifold  can be considered as
the orbifold of the  WZW model at level 1
by ,
= 1, _1 = i_1, _2 = i_2,
              _3 = i_3 
         D_2 = _2 _2 .
Here  changes the radius of  from 1 to 2,
while  does the reflection .
 acts on the boundary states as
  :  g  g ^-1   ,   .
The generic boundary states in the orbifold theory can therefore be written
in the form
  g _  = 1    
  _  g ^-1   ,   g SU(2) ,
unless  belongs to the fixed points of .

We have three types of fixed points

corresponding to three subgroups 
of ,
  F_a = g SU(2)   _a g _a^-1  =  g  .
We can parametrize  as follows,
  F_1 &=  f_1( )                 0   < 2 , 

  F_2 &=  f_2()                 0 < 2 , 

  F_3 &=  f_3()                 0 < 2 .
's intersect at ,
  F_1 F_2 F_3 = 1  .
Clearly,  consist of the fixed point set of .

In order to resolve these fixed points, we need additional Ishibashi states
from the twisted sectors.
We have three types of twisted sectors corresponding to three types
of fixed points .
For the fixed points , the necessary states are given by the
 Ishibashi states at ,
  _3(n)    1 2  
  ((n+1 2 )  + (-n-1 2 ) )   (n _0  ) .
The Dirichlet Ishibashi states in this equation coincide
with those for ,
since their momenta take values in half integers in the unit of 
(see eq.eq:pspec ).
Then one can resolve  to yield the fractional states
  f_3() _  &= 1 2 (f_3()  + f_3(-) )
  + 2^1/4  _3[]  ,  

  _3[]  &= _n _0  
  ((n + 1 2 )) _3(n)     (0 < 2) .
One can easily show that
these resolved states are nothing but
the usual (non-fractional) -branes in  at ,
  f_3() _= [/2] _O  .
For  and , the relevant twisted sectors are those coming from
the fixed points  of the reflection .
Within the chiral algebra
, we have four Ishibashi states from these twisted
sectors, namely,
 and .
These states are decomposed into infinite number of the Virasoro
Ishibashi states.
Actually, the overlaps of these states with themselves are
decomposed into the Virasoro characters as follows,
  _T(x)  q^H_c  _T(x)  &=

  1 (q)  _n   q^(n + 1 4 )^2  =
  _n   _n + 1 4    , 

  _T(x)  q^H_c  _T(x)  &=
  1 (q)  _n   (-1)^n q^(n + 1 4 )^2  =
  _n   (-1)^n _n + 1 4    .
Consequently, the Ishibashi states
 can be written in the form
  _T(x)  &= _n   n+1 4  ; x  , 

  _T(x)  &= _n   (-1)^n n+1 4  ; x  ,
where  is the Virasoro Ishibashi state
with dimension  from the twisted sector of .
Using these states, we can write down the Ishibashi states
for the resolution of the fixed points  and ,
  _1(n)  &1 2  
  ( n 2  + 1 4  ; 0  -
    n 2  + 1 4  ;   ) ,
   

  _2(n)  &1 2  
  ( n 2  + 1 4  ; 0  +
    n 2  + 1 4  ;   )   (n _0 ) .
  These Ishibashi states 
from the twisted sectors satisfy
  _a(m)  q^H_c  _b(n)  =
  _ab  _mn  1 (q) 
  q^1 4 (n + 1 2 )^2  .
Then the resolved boundary states can be constructed in a way parallel
to eq.eq:f3 , namely,
  f_a() _&=
  1 2 (f_a()  + f_a(-) ) +
  2^1/4  _a[]  ,

  _a[]  &= _n _0  
  ((n + 1 2 )) _a(n)    (0 < 2) .
Among these states, we can find the fractional -branes
of ,
  f_1(/2) _&= []; + _O  ,   f_1(3/2) _= []; - _O  , 

  f_2(/2) _&= [0]; + _O  ,   f_2(3/2) _= [0]; - _O  .
At , we might expect further resolution
since all the elements  fix .
For , we actually need one more resolution
and the result is given by the fractional -branes of the orbifold
  [0];  _O 
  &= 1 2 g=1  + 2^1/4  1 2 
  (_3[0]  (_2[0]  + _1[0] ) ) , 

  [];  _O 
  &= 1 2 g=1  + 2^1/4  1 2 
  (-_3[0]  (_2[0]  + _1[0] ) ) .
For , however, all the fractional branes in eq:fa 
give the same result
  f_1() _= f_3() _= f_3() _=
  g = -1  .
Clearly, this state can not be decomposed any more and
we have no resolution at .
