We use the matrix model to describe the 
 supersymmetric gauge theories with massive hypermultiplets
in the fundamental representation.
By taking the tree level superpotential perturbation made of a polynomial
of a scalar chiral multiplet, the effective action for the eigenvalues of
chiral multiplet can be obtained. By varying this action with respect to
an eigenvalue, a loop equation is obtained.
By analyzing this equation, we derive the Seiberg-Witten curve
within the context of matrix model.










Introduction 


Recently Dijkgraaf and Vafa have made a conjecture, the
exact superpotential and gauge couplings for a class of 
 gauge theories can be obtained by calculating perturbative
computations in a matrix model in which the superpotential of the
gauge theory is interpreted as an ordinary potential. The earlier
works motivated this conjecture. Based on this
observation, there are many works on this direction
-. In particular, we restrict to the
supersymetric  gauge theories. The model with quartic
tree level superpotential for adjoint chiral field was found
 and the effective superpotential was computed in the
context of matrix model and string theory on Calabi-Yau geometry
with flux. The perturbative calculation for glueball
superpotential was studied in. For arbitrary tree level
superpotentials, the planar and leading nonplanar contributions
were derived by using higher genus loop equations and
diagrammatics. A field theoretic derivation of
the superpotential was given in based on the
factorization property of Seiberg-Witten curve. An equivalence of
 gauge theories deformed from  by the
addition of superpotential terms was studied with flavors
 and without flavors based on the
Cachazo-Vafa's idea: The low energy information is given
by extremization of the effective superpotential and in the field
theory analysis it is given by characterizing to the factorization
locus of Seiberg-Witten curve and the equivalence of two
description was given in.


In this paper, we compute the matrix path integral over tree level
superpotential obtained from  SQCD by taking arbitrary
polynomial of a scalar chiral multiplet as a perturbation. The
effective theory action can be expressed as a function of an
eigenvalue of chiral multiplet. The saddle point equation implies
an algebraic equation defined on  a hyperelliptic Riemann surface.
The presence of this curve allows us to study the relation of
matrix model and the gauge theory result of perturbative
calculation. By using the basic idea of matrix model, we calculate
a partition function in terms of a glueball field, a distribution
of eigenvalue of chiral multiplet, a perturbed superpotential and
the mass of quarks. By reading off the two free energy
contributions from a partition function, one obtains the final
effective superpotential in terms of homology basis. By varying
this effective superpotential with respect to the coefficient
function appearing in the algebraic curve, one realizes the
existence of a meromorphic function on Riemann surface with the
appropriate structure of zeros and poles. In doing this, the
correct counting of the number of physical D5-branes in the
presence of orientifold planes (O5-planes) is very important
because these values determine the structure of zeros and poles
precisely. By identifying this function with the resolvent of
matrix model, the Seiberg-Witten curves for 
 gauge theory with  hypermultiplets are
rederived. For  gauge theory with  flavors of quarks in
the fundamental representation, the derivation of Seiberg-Witten
curve was found in. It would be interesting to study
the results in to deal with the model
given this paper.


 matrix model  


We will derive the Seiberg-Witten curve for 
 gauge theory with  fundamental hypermultiplets
by computing the matrix path integral using the saddle
point method.
Let us
consider  an  supersymmetric  gauge theory
with  flavors of quarks 

 in the vector (fundamental)
representation.
In terms of  superfields,  vector multiplet
consists of  a field strength chiral multiplet  and a scalar
chiral multiplet  both in the adjoint representation of
the gauge group.
The  superpotential takes the form
W_tree (, Q) =
2  Q^i_a _ab  Q^j_b J_ij  + 2  m_ij  Q^i_a Q^j_a
where
  is the symplectic metric

used to raise and lower  flavor indices ( 
 is the  identity matrix ) and
 is a quark mass matrix 
. Classically, the
global symmetries are the flavor symmetry  and 
 chiral R-symmetry. When , the theory is
asymptotically free and generates dynamically a strong coupling
scale . The instanton factor is proportional to
. Then  symmetry is anomalous and
broken down to a discrete  symmetry by instanton.
By taking a tree level superpotential perturbation  made
out of the adjoint field in the vector multiplet to the 
 superpotential (), the  supersymmetry
can be broken to  supersymmetry. That is, W =
W_tree (, Q) + W, W _k=1 ^[
N 2  ]   g_2k  2k  Tr  ^2k . Then a microscopic   gauge theory is
obtained from   Yang-Mills theory perturbed by
.

By using the perturbed superpotential in addition to the tree
level one, substituting the whole superpotential into the 
matrix model at large  and replacing the gauge theory fields
with matrices, we study the various contributions to the free
energy. Then the partition function can be written as Z =
1 vol(SO(N))  [d ] [ d Q] [-1 g_s 
 W() -  2  Q^i_a _ab  Q^j_b J_ij  - 2 
m_ij  Q^i_a Q^j_a ]  where for
simplicity we change the notation W() =
_k=1 ^[ N 2  ]+1   g_2k  2k 
Tr  ^2k . A superpotential  of order
 breaks the gauge symmetry down to
a direct product of  subgroup. One
can write the derivative of  with respect to the field W^ (x) = x^2N  + _i=1 ^N  s_2i  x^2(N-i)  =
_i=1 ^N  ( x^2-e_i^2 ) where
's are the classical moduli and the symmetric polynomial
 in  is s_2k  = (-1)^k _i_1 < <
i_k  e_i_1 ^2 e_i_k ^2. The description for
the addition of the mass term for the adjoint scalar only was
studied in the context of matrix model. The matrix
description for pure flavors without any adjoint fields to check
the Seiberg duality was observed in. Let us study
 matrix model by considering even  and odd  case
separately because the Jacobian has different form in each case
and also the spectral curves are different. Now we first analyze
 matrix model.

  matrix model

According to the procedureand by integrating over 
in our case, the eigenvalue  basis provides
Z _a=1 ^N  [d ] _a < b ^N 
( _a^2 -_b^2 )^2
[
-1 g_s  _a=1 ^N   2 W(_a)
- _i=1 ^N_f   (_a^2 -m_i^2 )
   ]
where  are the eigenvalues of 

 and  is a quark mass 
. Note the factor
2 in the first term of the exponent. The second term comes from
the determinant of . The new thing in our problem is the
flavor part in the last term. For  theory without any
flavors these terms are absent. After
exponentiating, the effective action for the eigenvalues is given
by
S() = -_a < b ^N ( _a^2 -_b^2
)^2 + 1 g_s  _a=1 ^N  2 W(_a) +
_i=1 ^N_f   (_a^2 -m_i^2 ).
In
this way, the potential  contains a collection of 
variables . Remember that due to
the antisymmetric property of  and the trace of it vanishes,
only even terms in the potential  which is a polynomial of
order  contribute. The saddle point equations (classical
equations of motion) coming from varying the action with respect
to a single eigenvalue  are
_ba ^N
2_a _a^2-_b^2  -1 g_s  W^  (_a) -
_i=1 ^N_f  _a _a^2-m_i^2  =0. To solve this let us introduce the trace of the resolvent
of the matrix
(x) = 1 N  Tr  1 = 1 N  _a=1 ^
N  2x _a^2-x^2 .
Then multiplying
() by  and summing over an index ,
one gets a loop  equation for 
^2(x)
 +  2 S  (x)  W^ (x) + f(x) S^2 =0
where 
the  is defined as  being fixed in the large  limit
and 
the polynomial  is given by
f(x)  4 g_s _a=1 ^N 
 _a  W^ (_a)- x  W^ (x)  _a^2-x^2 
which is a polynomial of order  with even
powers. Therefore the function  determines the solution of
the matrix integral. Here we take the large  limit and drop
the terms like  and  which will be
important when we expand it with respect to  in order to
derive the Seiberg-Witten differential completely within the
framework of the matrix model.  
The spectral curve reduces to 
y^2= W^ (x) ^2 - f(x), f(x) = _n=0 ^N-1 
b_2n  x^2n  


where we define y(x) =W^ (x)+
S (x). 


This is nothing but a hyperelliptic curve in
 plane. 
 We have to determine the  unknown
coefficients .
As in, there exists two particular points
denoted by  and  located at the two pre images of 
of . The force equation becomes 2 y()= - g_s S  . The solution for resolvent is given by
 
(x) =
  W^ (x) ^2 - f(x)  - W^ (x).


which is expressed as an  unknown coefficient
function appearing in the polynomial . The resolvent has the
branch cuts among which the eigenvalues of the matrix are
distributed.

 In the large  limit, the distribution of
eigenvalues can be written as ()= 1 N 
_a=1 ^N  (-_a), () d =1
and the resolvent becomes in this limit (x) = 2
_0 ^  x () d  ^2-x^2  =
  _0 ^ 
() d (1 - 1 +x  )=
 _- ^ 
 () d  which implies that
()  =
 1 2i  [ (+i ) - () ]
 =  1 2i  [ y(+i ) - y() ]. The filling fractions are given by
S_i = 1 2 i  _A_i  y d x, S_0 = 1 4 i  _A_0  y d
x
where we take the half of the cycle around  due
to the orientifold projection. In order to find out the functional
behavior of  within the matrix model, the saddle point
computation of the partition function gives rise to up to 
term as follows:
Z &=& [-2S g_s^2  d () W() + S^2 g_s^2  d d ^ 
()
(^ ) (^2 -^  ^2) ] 

&& +[ -S g_s  _i=1 ^N_f  d () (^2 -m_i^2) ] [-1 g_s^2  F _2 - 1 g_s  F _1]. To get the effective superpotential,
one should know both the variation of  under a small
change in  and  that can be read off from
().  For the former, we take the following change in

() () + S_i S  (-e_i)

where
 is an arbitrary point along the -th cut on the hyperelliptic
Riemann surface.
From the explicit form of  in ()
one considers
F _2 = S_i ( 2W(e_i) - 2S d ()
(^2-e_i^2)).
Then the partial derivative of  with respect to
 becomes
F _2 S_i   & = & - 2 _e_i ^P  dx W^ (x)
-4 S d ()  _e_i ^P 
x d x ^2-x^2 


&=&   - 2  _e_i ^P 
dx ( W^ (x) +  S (x)  )
=  - 2 _e_i ^P  y(x)  dx  =
 - ( _e_i ^P  +  ^e_i _Q ) y(x)  dx
up to an irrelevant constant of integration terms.
Moreover the  term can be written as F _1 &
= &  2S _i=1 ^N_f  d ()
 _ m_i ^P   x d x  ^2-x^2 
=   S  _i=1 ^N_f 
 _m_i ^P    (x) d x  

& = &   _i=1 ^N_f 
_ m_i ^P  y(x) d x = 1 2  _i=1 ^N_f 
_ m_i ^P  y(x) d x +
 1 2  _i=1 ^N_f 
_-m_i ^P  y(x) d x
up to the  independent terms.

Combining the two contributions  () and ()
one gets the effective superpotential
W=

 -1 2 (2N-2) _Q ^P  y dx + 1 2  _i=1 ^N_f 
_ m_i ^P  y d x +
 1 2  _i=1 ^N_f 
_-m_i ^P  y d x+ Here there are
some remarks in order. 
In the type IIB string theory, the  gauge theory is realized by
the worldvolume of  D5-branes wrapped on 
and in the dual geometry D5-branes are replaced by RR fluxes
generating the effective superpotential and the  by . 
In order to deal with the gauge groups  and  , 
one needs to introduce the orientifold plane into the geometry.
This will change the contributions of RR fluxes below.
The physical D5-brane charge of orientifold
plane (O5-plane) is  and the total  D5-branes wrapping
around the origin should be modified by . Moreover the
branch cuts in figure 1 in are symmetric, due to the
 symmetry, with the one located in the center (We follow the
notations given in). This implies that the
contribution from the compact cycle with  is exactly the
same as the one with . That is, by replacing the D5-branes
with the fluxes, one gets_a_k  h =
1 2  N_k=_a_-k   h = 1 2  N_-k , _a_0  h =1 2  (2N_0-2).
By summing over the
all  contour,
_P  h =( 2_k=1 ^N N_k
+2N_0 )-2 =2N-2, _Q  h = -(2N-2), _m_i  h = -1
where  is an one form on the
Riemann surface. So  should have a pole of order 1 at  and
 with residues  and  respectively. By using
the properties  and 
 given in, one can
divide into two parts: the cycle around  and the one around
. Then we have extra two contributions in
() denoted by , Yang-Mills coupling term and
the term with the cycle . But if we take the variation of
, the first contribution will give rise to a trivial cycle and
the second one gives an element of the period lattice. For 
gauge theory, the discussion on this matter was considered in
. Since  can be determined by  (and therefore
), we have to compute the variation of  with respect to
.
y b_2n   d x = -x^2n  2y 
dx, n=0, 1, , N-1
which is a complete
basis of holomorphic differentials (one forms) on the Riemann
surface. By changing the bases to the homology basis, the extremum
condition of  will give rise to 


(2N-2) _p_0 ^Q _k -(2N-2N_f-2)
_p_0 ^P _k -  _i=1 ^N_f 
( _p_0 ^ m_i  +  _p_0 ^- m_i  ) _k   =0
modulo the period lattice and  is an arbitrary generic
point on the Riemann surface.

There exists a function on the Riemann surface with an -th order
pole at , an -th order zero at  and
simple
zeros at  for each
, according to Abel's theorem.
The function is simply related to the resolvent divided by 
(We refer to with flavors and
 without flavors for the geometric picture)
z(x) = y x^2 - W^ (x) x^2 =
 W^ (x) ^2 x^4 -f(x) x^4   -
 W^ (x) x^2 , 2N_f < 2N-2.
This function has an -th order pole at  and
at least fourth order pole at  since  is a polynomial of
at most -th order. Therefore  should contain a
factor  for each  in order for  to have a
simple zero at  and should be at most -th
order in order for  to satisfy an -th order
zero at . Combining these two conditions and putting the
proportional constant as , the spectral
curve is y^2 = _i=1 ^N   (x^2 -e_i^2)^2-
_N=2 ^4N-2N_f-4  x^4 _i=1 ^N_f  (x^2-m_i^2) which is exactly the Seiberg-Witten curve 
in the field theory analysis where we used the relation
(). So far we assumed that the number of flavors are not
too large. Next we consider the case of large flavors.

For , the function  is given by
z(x) = 
A(x)^2 x^4 -g(x) x^4   -
 A(x) x^2 , 2N-2 < 2N_f < 4N-4
where  is an -th order polynomial and 
is proportional to . The
presence of this new function comes from the fact that when the
 is greater than , it is not enough to have the
function  only because the pole structure at  needs to
introduce a new function. Now we take the proportional constant as
. Then the function  vanishes at
 for each  and has an -th
order pole at  and -th order pole at . The
expression inside of square root in  should be proportional
to 
A(x)^2 x^4  - _N=2 ^4N-2N_f-4 
_i=1 ^N_f  (x^2-m_i^2) =
W^ (x) ^2 x^4 -f(x) x^4 
where
 is a polynomial of order at most . The solution for
this up to  is given by
A(x)
& = & _i=1 ^N  (x^2 -e_i^2) + _N=2 ^4N-2N_f-4 
P(x), 

f(x) & = & _N=2 ^4N-2N_f-4  ( x^4 _i=1 ^N_f 
(x^2-m_i^2)- 2 P(x) _i=1 ^N   (x^2 -e_i^2)) where  is defined as a polynomial of degree
 in  and . Therefore the spectral curve and
the function are given by y^2  & = &   _i=1 ^N   (x^2 -e_i^2)^2 -f(x) 

& = &
 _i=1 ^N   [ (x^2 -e_i^2) + _N=2 ^4N-2N_f-4 
P(x)  ]^2- _N=2 ^4N-2N_f-4  x^4
_i=1 ^N_f  (x^2-m_i^2), 

z(x) & = &   y x^2  -A(x) x^2 . Therefore in both regions of the number of flavors the spectral
curve coming from the matrix model calculations coincides with
precisely the known Seiberg-Witten curve.

   matrix model

Let us describe the odd case. Since the presentation looks similar to
the one in previous discussion, we will present the main difference only.
By integrating over , the eigenvalue  basis
providesZ _a=1 ^N  [d ] _a < b ^N 
( _a^2 -_b^2 )^2 _a=1 ^N  _a^2
[
-1 g_s  _a=1 ^N   2 W(_a)
- _i=1 ^N_f   (_a^2 -m_i^2 )
   ]
where  are the eigenvalues of 

 and  is a quark mass 
. Note that
there exists an extra factor  in this
case. Then the effective action for the
eigenvalues is given by
S() = -_a < b ^N (
_a^2 -_b^2 )^2 - _a=1 ^N _a^2 +
1 g_s  _a=1 ^N   2 W(_a) + _i=1 ^N_f   (_a^2 -m_i^2 ).
By varying the action
with respect to an eigenvalue one gets
_ba 
2_a _a^2-_b^2  -1 _a  -1 g_s 
W^  (_a) -  _i=1 ^N_f  _a _a^2-m_i^2 
=0.
In the large  limit, the second extra term
comparing with the previous case  matrix model does not
contribute. Therefore all the arguments from () to
() in even  gauge theory are valid for 
matrix model. By an appropriate counting the physical D5-brane
charge of the orientifold which is equal to , one
gets
_a_k  h = 1 2  N_k=_a_-k   h =
1 2  N_-k , _a_0  h =1 2  (2N_0-1).
By summing over the all  contour,
_P 
h =( 2_k=1 ^N N_k +2N_0 )-1 =2N-1, _Q  h = -(2N-1), _m_i  h = -1
where  is an one form on the Riemann surface.

The extremum condition of  () where the coefficient
 is replaced with  will give rise to (2N-1)
_p_0 ^Q _k -(2N-2N_f-1) _p_0 ^P _k -
_i=1 ^N_f  ( _p_0 ^ m_i  +  _p_0 ^- m_i 
) _k =0 modulo the period lattice. Then the
function is simply related to the resolvent divided by  z(x) = y x - W^ (x) x = 
W^ (x) ^2 x^2 -f(x) x^2   -
 W^ (x) x , 2N_f < 2N-1.
This function has an -th
order pole at  and at least third order pole at  since
 is a polynomial of at most -th order. Therefore
 should contain a factor  for each  in order
for  to have a simple zero at  and should be at
most -th order in order for  to satisfy an
-th order zero at . Combining these two conditions
and putting the proportional constant as ,
the spectral curve is
y^2 = _i=1 ^N   (x^2 -e_i^2)^2-
_N=2 ^4N-2N_f-2  x^2 _i=1 ^N_f  (x^2-m_i^2)
which is known as the Seiberg-Witten curve
 in the perturbative calculation in gauge
theory side.

For , the function  is given by
z(x) = 
A(x)^2 x^2 -g(x) x^2   -
 A(x) x , 2N-1 < 2N_f < 4N-2
where  is an -th order polynomial and
 is proportional to . Now
we take the proportional constant as . Then
the function  vanishes at  for each 
 and has an -th order pole at  and
-th order pole at . The expression inside of
square root in  should be proportional to 
A(x)^2 x^2  - _N=2 ^4N-2N_f-2  _i=1 ^N_f 
(x^2-m_i^2) = W^ (x) ^2 x^2 -f(x) x^2  where  is a polynomial of order at most . It is
straightforward to see the coincidence of the Seiberg-Witten
curve. From the properties of  in () and
(), one can easily see that h(x) d x= d z z 
is a meromorphic differential with simple poles at 
 and  with residues  and 1
respectively for  gauge theory, for example.


 matrix model 


In this section, we continue to study the matrix model for the
symplectic group . Let us consider  an 
supersymmetric  gauge theory with  flavors of quarks
 in the
fundamental representation. The tree level superpotential of the
theory is obtained fromW_tree (, Q) = 2  Q^i_a ^a_b Q^i_c J^bc  +
2  m_ij  Q^i_a Q^j_b J^ab  where
  is the symplectic metric
 and
 is a quark mass matrix 
. Classically, the
global symmetries are the flavor symmetry  and 
 chiral R-symmetry. When , the theory
is asymptotically free  and generates dynamically a strong
coupling scale . The instanton factor is proportional
to . Then  symmetry is anomalous and
broken down to a discrete  symmetry by instanton.

According to the procedureand by integrating over 
in our case, the eigenvalue  basis provides
Z _a=1 ^N  [d ] _a < b 
( _a^2 -_b^2 )^2
_a=1 ^N  _a^2
[
-1 g_s  _a=1 ^N   2 W(_a)
+ _i=1 ^N_f   (_a^2 -m_i^2 )
   ]
where  are the eigenvalues of 

 and
 is a quark mass

.
























By an appropriate counting the physical D5-brane charge of the
orientifold which is equal to 1, one gets
_a_k  h =
1 2  N_k=_a_-k   h = 1 2  N_-k , _a_0  h =1 2  (2N_0+2).
By summing over the
all  contour,
_P  h =( 2_k=1 ^N N_k
+2N_0 )+2 =2N+2, _Q  h = -(2N+2), _m_i  h = -1
where  is an one form on the
Riemann surface.

The extremum condition of  () where the coefficient
 is replaced with  will give rise to 



(2N+2) _p_0 ^Q _k -(2N-2N_f+2) _p_0 ^P _k -
_i=1 ^N_f  ( _p_0 ^ m_i  +  _p_0 ^- m_i 
) _k   =0.
   There exists a function on the
Riemann surface with an -th order pole at , an
-th order zero at  and simple zeros at 
for each . The function is simply related to
the resolvent z(x) =   x^4
W^ (x) ^2-  f(x)  -
 x^2  W^ (x).

This function has an -th order pole at  and
at least zero-th order pole at  since  is a polynomial of
at most -th order. Therefore  should contain a
factor  for each  in order for  to have a
simple zero at  and should be at most -th order
in order for  to satisfy an -th order zero at
. Combining these two conditions and putting the proportional
constant as , the spectral curve is





y^2 = ( x^2 _i=1 ^N   ( x^2 -e_i^2) )^2 -
_N=2 ^4N-2N_f+4  _i=1 ^N_f  (x^2-m_i^2).
In
the gauge theory side, for the Seiberg-Witten curve
 for  case at least one hypermultiplet
of exactly zero mass (for example, ), the above matrix
model result is exactly the same  the one inbecause the extra piece which is peculiar to  case, the
product of quark mass term vanishes. For nonzero quark
mass, one can consider the following resolvent


 by including the constant term 
( independent term)  inside the square.  
By identifying this  with ,
one obtains the Seiberg-Witten curve.
