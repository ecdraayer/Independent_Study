Abstract  



The duality map between gauge theories and strings suggests that
when the gauge theory is in the weak coupling regime the dual string
tension effectively tends to zero, .
This observation of Sundborg and Witten initiates a fresh
interest to the old problem of tensionless limit of standard
string theory and to the description of its genuine symmetries.
We approach this problem formulating tensionless string theory
by means of geometrical concept of surface perimeter.
The perimeter action uniquely leads to a tensionless theory.








Introduction 

It is a longstanding problem to describe low energy behavior
of QCD in terms of string-like extended objects.
Naive identification of standard string theory spectrum with hadronic
spectrum encounters a number of
conceptual problems connected with the appearance
of massless states containing graviton in the string spectrum, soft behavior
of high energy scattering amplitudes, opposite to what one should
expect in parton-like picture of asymptotically free gauge theories
and, not the least, higher dimensional space-time.


Essential progress was achieved in
where the AdS/CFT correspondence was proposed relating the
classical supergravity approximation 
of closed IIB  strings moving on ten-dimensional curved space-time
background   with large t'Hooft coupling regime of
 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory
.
In this duality map
one side is weakly coupled, the other is strongly coupled and
there is a natural prescription relating
physical quantities in string and gauge theories,
in particular, identifying  stringy states corresponding
to the leading Regge trajectory with highly excited gauge
theory operators
.
The conjecture was applied to calculate Wilson loops,
anomalous dimensions, etc. on the gauge theory
side at strong coupling regime.



If one adopts the strong form of the Maldacena conjecture
stating that two theories are exactly the same for all
values of coupling constants,
then it is important to understand what string theory is like
in the opposite limit
when the gauge theory is in the weak coupling regime
 .
In that regime the string tension 

effectively tends to zero and it is natural to assume that
free gauge theory, , corresponds to zero tension string
theory, that is to the string theory at extreme energies
.
The dual description of weakly interacting gauge theory states
on the boundary, in particular, operators
with minimal twist, consisting of bilinear high spin tensors,
on the  side are supposed to be expressed
in terms of locally interacting
massless gauge fields of arbitrarily high spin

.
The gauge theory correlation
functions on the boundary define a high spin
field theory in the bulk with nontrivial interaction vertices
, and
the resulting holographically dual classical gauge field theory
would be the effective description of the desirable string theory
in the bulk,
celebrated symmetric phase of string theory.



This development initiates a fresh interest to the old problem
of tensionless limit of the standard string theory and to the
description of its genuine symmetries

.
In recent publications we approached this problem
formulating tensionless strings by means of geometrical
concept of surface perimeter, or its length
. The perimeter action
uniquely leads to tensionless theory.
It was suggested that nonlinear world-sheet sigma model
which describes tensionless limit is defined by the following action:
funaction 
S =m L=  m d^2 h K^ia _a K^ib _b  ,
here  has dimension of mass,  is the induced metric and
 is the second fundamental form (extrinsic curvature)
(This action is essentially different
in its geometrical meaning from the action considered in
previous studies where it is proportional
to the spherical angle and has dimensionless coupling constant.) .
Instead of being proportional to the area of the surfaces, as it
is the case in the standard string theory:




the perimeter action () is proportional
to the length of the surface.
Due to the last property the model
has two desirable features. First of all, when the surface degenerates
into a single world line, the perimeter action () becomes
proportional to the length of the world linelimit 
S   m 1 - V^2 _  K(s,t)   dsdt
    m  1 - V^2 _   2 dt,
where  is a string curvature.
Thanks to this property the functional integral
over surfaces simply transforms
into the Feynman path integral for a point-like relativistic particle,
naturally extending it to relativistic strings. Secondly,
the action is equal to the perimeter of the flat Wilson loop ,
where R is space distance between quarks,
therefore at the classical level string tension is equal to zero .
The action() can be written in the equivalent
form 
where    is the induced
metric, 
  is Laplace operator, (The equivalence follows
from the relations: ,
where   are the normals and

) 
.


In the present work I shall
consider so called model B ,
in which two fields - the world-sheet metric and  -
the embedding  field are considered as
independent, that is we abandon  the relation
    between them.
At this stage there is no direct relation of the model with
embedding into space-time and the model can be considered as
two-dimensional quantum gravity interacting
with scalar fields . We shall refer to the original theory,
where fields are not independent, as to model A . The interrelation
between them is considered in.



We shall fix the conformal gauge  using the
reparametrization invariance of the action ()
and represent it in two equivalent forms gaga 
S=m  d^2 (^2 
X )^2       S  =
1 d^2  ^  ^2  X^ 
-    ( ^2  -m^2) ,
where we have introduced the independent field  and
the Lagrange multiplier  . The system of equations
which follows from 
orig 
(I)            ^2 ^  =0,        
^2 X^  - 2^  =0,        
^ _   = m^2 
is equivalent to the original equation for 
which follows from 
confequa1 
(I')                ^2 (m ^2 X_  
(^2 X )^2  ) =0.
The
 field has the form




In addition to the reparametrization invariance the system
exhibits a new gauge symmetry.
For a given parametrization the additional invariance has the form




where  and  is
arbitrary vector field on the world-sheet.
The above gauge transformation
newgauge 
^2  X^' _  = (1 +    2 
(^2 X )^2  )  ^2  X_ 
defines a set of  fields  describing the same
physics and can be seen as the gauge orbit of this extra
symmetry. Notice that fields on a given gauge orbit are not
related by reparametrization.  This gauge symmetry
renders the  string space-time coordinate  "less"
physical, not gauge invariant observable. Instead, the string
momentum  is a gauge
invariant quantity because .



Quantization of the bosonic string B  and its massless spectrum
has been derived in.
The absence of conformal anomaly requires the space-time to be 13-dimensional
. In this string theory
all particles, with arbitrary large integer spin, are massless . This
pure massless spectrum is consistent with the tensionless character
of the model and it was conjectured inthat it may describe unbroken phase of standard string theory  when
 and all masses tend to zero
 .



Supersymmetric extension of the model B 
with  world-sheet supersymmetry
was constructed in.
Here I shall demonstrate that actually
it possesses enhanced fermionic symmetry which elevates
 world-sheet supersymmetry to   world-sheet
supersymmetry. Indeed quantization of the supersymmetric model
shows that its gauge algebra is identical with the well known
 world-sheet superalgebra.
This new field theory realization of the 
algebra is free from old problem

connected with the introduction of
second  space-time coordinate  , which was
introduced in addition to the coordinates
.
Instead, in this model we have naturally
two left-movers  and  and two right-movers
 and  of the  field
ritghleft 
X^ _L  = x^  +
1m ^ ^+  +
^ _n=1 2n m^2    q^ _1n (n^+ ) +
q^ _2n (n^+ ),

X^ _R  =   x^ 
+  1m ^ ^-  +
^ _n=1 2n m^2    q ^  _1n (n^- ) +
q ^  _2n (n^- ).The conjugate field is described by a separate field ,
^ _L =   m e^  +
 k^ ^+  + ^ _n=1 2m^2n  
 -p^ _1n (n^+ ) + p^ _2n (n^+ ),

^ _R =   m e^  +
k^ ^-  + ^ _n=1 2m^2n  
-p ^ _1n (n^- ) + p ^ _2n (n^- ),
therefore we have two times more degrees of freedom than in the
standard bosonic string theory. This result can be qualitatively
understood if one takes into account the fact that the field
equations here are of the fourth order ().
Notice that there is also doubling of zero modes,
the new zero mode coordinates are  and their
conjugate variables are , they
describe transversal polarizations.




In the first part of this article I shall review the quantization of the
bosonic tensionless string and shall describe its symmetries.
In the second part
I shall present oscillator representation of the supersymmetric
extension of the model and its quantization. In the last section the
twisted topological string model will be constructed in analogy with the
standard prescription for  superconformal
field theories
.

Closed Bosonic Strings 

In this section I shall review some facts concerning solution and
quantization of the closed bosonic string which was defined in the previous
section and shall discuss algebraic structure of the
corresponding gauge symmetries (),()
and ().
As we shall see they naturally contain Virasoro algebra as its subalgebra
and additional new generators  associated with
new gauge symmetry () forming an Abelian subalgebra.
The conformal algebra has here its
classical form with twice larger central
charge .
This result can be qualitatively understood if one takes
into account the fact that the field equations here are of the fourth order
and therefore we have two left and
two right movers of  field,
two times more degrees of freedom than in the
standard bosonic string theory. Therefore it is not surprising
that the absence of conformal anomaly requires the space-time
to be 13-dimensional: .



For the closed bosonic strings the mode expansion of  field
() can be written in the form:
decom 
X^ _L  = x^  +
1m ^ ^+  +
i_n 0   1n    ^ _n  e^-in^+  ,

X^ _R  =   x^ 
+  1m ^ ^-  +
i_n 0   1n     ^ _n  e^-in^-  ,where



and in similar manner



^ _L =   m e^  +  k^ ^+  +
i_n 0   1n    ^ _n  e^-in^+  ,

^ _R =   m e^  + k^ ^-  +
i_n 0   1n     ^ _n  e^-in^-  .
The nonzero commutator is





with all others equal to zero.
The momentum density operator is 
.
This canonical commutation among the fields imply also
the following commutation relations among the coefficients of
the Fourier expansion ():
[e^ , ^ ]=[x^ , k^ ] =  i^ ,   
 [^ _n , ^ _k ]= n ^ _n+k,0 
and similar ones for  and
. All other commutators are equal to zero.
 They are connected with the creation and
annihilation operators in the following way
^ _n &=& m n  a^ _n ,
    n > 0,     ^ _0 =k^ ;   
^ _n = 1m  n  b^ _n ,   
n > 0,     ^ _0 =^ /m  

^ _-n &=& m n  a^+ _n ,
    n > 0,                   
^ _-n = 1m  n  b^+ _n ,   
n > 0,
with nonzero commutator




The Virasoro operators   and
new operators  are defined as
constcompo 
L_n   = <e^in^+  :P^ _L  _+ X^ _L : >,    
_n,l   =  <e^in^+ + il^-  :  ^  ^  -m^2  :>
and have the form
oscillators 
L_n  &=&_l :_n-l  _l :     
L _n  =_l :  _n-l   _l :

_0,0  &=& m^2( e^2  -1)
+ _n 0 
14 n^2 :(_-n  _n  +
 _-n   _n ):

_n,0  &=& imn  e _n 
-14 _l 0,n 
1(n-l)l :_n-l _l :           n=1,2,..

_0,n  &=&imn  e  _n 
-14 _l 0,n 
1(n-l)l : _n-l  _l :
           n=1,2,..

_n,k  &=& -12 n k :_n  _k :
         n,k= 1, 2,....
The conformal algebra has here its classical form but
with twice larger central charge
oldalgebra 
[L_n  ,  L_k] = (n-k) L_n+k  + D6 (n^3 -n)_n+k,0 
and with the similar expression for right movers .
The reason that the central charge is twice bigger than in the
standard bosonic string theory 
is simply because we have two left and
two right movers of  field.
Such doubling of modes is reminiscent to the bosonic part of the
 superstring. In the last model there was an
essential problem in identifying the  coordinates which are
introduced in addition to the normal coordinates 
.
In our model the coordinate field  has simply
two sets of commuting oscillators and the conjugate fields are
described by the separate field  .

The full extended gauge symmetry algebra of constraints
() takes the form
newalgebra1 
 [L_n   , _0,0 ] &=& -2n  _n,0                             
[L _n   , _0,0 ] = -2n _0,n  

 [L_n , _k,0 ] &=& -(n+k) _n+k,0                    
[L _n , _k,0 ] = -2n _k,n 

 [L_n , _0,k ] &=& -2n_n,k                             
[L _n ,  _0,k ]
= -(n+k) _0,n+k  

 [L_n  , _k,l ] &=& -(n+k) _n+k,l                    
[L _n , _k,l ]
= -(n+l) _k,n+l  

and one should stress that it is an essentially Abelian extension
newalgebra 
 [_n,k  , _l,p ] =
0,     n,k,l,p=0, 1,2,...
One can easily check that Jacobi identities  between all
these operators are satisfied, therefore the relations
(), () and ()
define Abelian extension of Virasoro algebra. The equations
() suggest its oscillator representation.


To define the physical Hilbert space we should first
impose the Virasoro constraints
physicalh 
(L_0 +a)_phys  &=&0



L_n _phys  &=&





0,      n =1,2..and then our new constraint . The last operator
has a linear and quadratic  dependence which in fact
uniquely define the spectrum of this string theory






Indeed the first operator diverges quadratically with 
and the second one linearly. Therefore in order to have
normalizable states in physical Hilbert-Fock space
one should impose corresponding constraints.
We are enforced to define the physical Hilbert space as
newconst 
k^2   _phys  =0,   e k  _phys  =0,
   k _n    _phys  =0,   k  _n   _phys  =0,     n>0.
The first equation states that all physical states with different spins
are massless . This is consistent with the tensionless character
of the theory. The rest of the constraints take the form
newconstraints 



_n,k _phys   &=&0             n,k= 0,1,2,....















Thus the the physical Hilbert space is defined by the equations
(), () and ().
In the next section we shall consider 
world-sheet supersymmetric extension of the
above model and shall demonstrate that it
actually exhibits the 
world-sheet supersymmetry.


 World-sheet Supersymmetry 

In the recent article the authors constructed
the  supersymmetric extension of the above model using world-sheet
superfields.
Both forms of the action () can be extended to the
supersymmetric case as follows.
For the basic fields  in ()
one should introduce the corresponding superfields
X ^  &=& X^  +   ^ + 12 
  F^ 

 ^  &=& ^  +   ^ + 12 
  ^ 

   &=&  +   + 12 
  ,
where  is an anti-commuting variable
and shall define the supersymmetric action
simply exchanging basic fields  
in () by corresponding superfields
as follows
firstordsusy 
S = -i 2  d^2 d^2     ^ 
D  D X ^  - 2  (  ^2  -m^2) ,
where
D_A =   ^A  -
i (^a  )_A _a ,    
^ _A () (   ), ^ _A ()
     (   ), _A ()
     (   ),
 is a space-time vector index,  is a
two-dimensional spinor index.
  and
 are two-dimensional Dirac matrices
 ^a ,^b   =-2 ^a b .
In Majorana basis the  are given by
^0  = (   ),    ^1  = (   )
and  is a real operator.
The two-dimensional chiral fields are defined as



where .
Substituting superfields one can get the following expression
for the actionfullaction 
S =
1  d^2    ^ ^2 X^ 
+ i^  ^a  _a ^ 
-F^ ^   

  -(^2 -m^2)
-  (2^ ^  +
^  ^ ) - 2 ^  ^   .
The equations of motion are:
fullequationa 
(I)                   ^  =0

^2 ^  =0

i ^a  _a ^ =0

2 ^  + F^  =0

^2 X^  - 2^  -2^ 
-2^  i^a  _a ^  -2^ -2 ^ =0,
and the variation over Lagrange multipliers gives constraints
fullconstrants 
(II)                  ^2 -m^2 =0

2^ ^  +
^  ^ =0

2 ^  ^  =0.
The first equation represents the constrain which
appears in bosonic tensionless string theory
and the last equation represents its fermionic partners.
As we shall see the first one is the analog of
Klein-Gordon equation and the second one is the analog
of the Dirac equation. In some sense they are more important
relations than the motion equations (I).
The SUSY transformation is:
 
 
 
where the anti-commuting parameter  is a
two-dimensional spinor  
The action (), equations ()
and the constraints () completely define the
system which exhibits the supersymmetry ().

As we shall see bellow the action ()
possesses enhanced fermionic symmetry which elevates
 world-sheet supersymmetry up to   world-sheet
supersymmetry. It is convenient to work in
light-cone coordinates. In the light-cone coordinates
the action takes the form
lagran 
S = 2  d^2   - 2^ 
_+ _-  X^ 
+ i^ _+ _- ^ _+ 
+ i^ _- _+ ^ _- 
- 12 F^ ^    

  -12 (^2 -m^2)
-  (^ ^  +
 i^ _+ ^ _- )
-i ^  ^ _+ _- 
+ i ^  ^ _- _+  .
and equations of motion can be solved.
As one can see the SUSY solution of equations () is:



and the rest of the equations (I) reduce to the following form
(I)     ^2 ^  =0,   i ^a  _a ^ =0,   
^2 X^  =0,   
i^a  _a ^  =0,   F^ =^ =0
and should be accompanied by the constraints
(II)     ^2 -m^2 =0,    ^  ^ =0,    
^  ^  =0.
In the light-cone coordinates these  equations  are easy to solve
since they take the from
allequations 
_+ _-  ^  =0,   _ ^ _ =0,   
_+ _-   X^  =0,   
_ ^ _  =0,

^2 -m^2 =0,    ^ _+ ^ _-  -
^ _- ^ _+  =0    
^  ^ _  =0.
The mode expansion of  field
with the appropriate boundary conditions for closed strings
was given above ().
The solution of fermionic fields can be represented in
the form of mode expansion as well
^ _+ = c^ _n  e^-i n^+  ,     
^ _+ = d^ _n  e^-i n^+  

^ _- = c ^ _n  e^-i n^-  ,     
^ _- = d ^ _n  e^-i n^-  
with the basic anti-commutators
array lll 
 ^ _ (),^ _ (^' )= 2^  (- ^' ),
and all others equal to zero:

.
Substituting the mode expansion into the anti-commutators
requires following relations between modes
anticomm 
c^ _n , d^ _k = ^ _n+k,0 ,    
c^ _n , c^ _k =
0,     d^ _n , d^ _k = 0,
and similar ones for  and
.

Enhanced  World-sheet supersymmetry 
Let us now consider conserved currents: energy
momentum tensor and supercurrent
T_ab  &=&  _a   ^  _b  X^ 
+ i ^  _a  _b ^   -trace 

J_a  &=& 12  ^b _a 
^ _b ^ +12  ^b _a 
^ _b X^ 
or in the light-cone coordinates
T_++ &=&2_+ ^  _+ X^  +
i ^ _+  _+ ^ _+  - i2 _+ 
( ^ _+ ^ _+ ) ,

T_- &=&2_- ^  _- X^  +
i ^ _-  _- ^ _-  - i2 _- 
( ^ _- ^ _- ) ,  

 J_+ &=& 2_+ ^  ^ _+  +
2^ _+ _+ X^ ,

J_- &=& 2_- ^  ^ _-  +
2^ _- _- X^ ,
Substituting solution () into the last formulas one can get
T_++ &=&1 2  _+ ^ _L  _+ X^ _L +
i2  ^ _+  _+ ^ _+  - i2 
_+ ^ _+  ^ _+ ,

T_- &=&1 2  _- ^ _R  _- X^ _R 
+ i2  ^ _-  _- ^ _- 
- i2 _- ^ _-  ^ _-  ,

J_+ &=& _+ ^ _L ^ _+   +
^ _+  _+ X^ _L ,               

J_- &=& _- ^ _R ^ _-  +
^ _- _- X^ _R .
The mode expansion of these currents is equal to
L_n   &=& <e^in^+  T_++  >= _l :_n-l  _l :
+_l :(l-n2 ) c_n-l  d_l : 

F_n   &=&  <e^in^+  J_+  >=
_l _n-l  d_l   +
_l _n-l  c_l .
The standard computation of quantum commutation relations
between these currents gives
[L_n , L_m ] &=& (n-m) L_n+m  + D4  m^3 _n+m 

 [L_n , F_m ] &=& (n2 -m) F_n+m 

 F_n , F_m  &=& 2 L_n+m  + D n^2 _n+m .
This is a standard   superalgebra with the central
charge twice larger than in the standard superstring
theory. It is also clear from the expression for
the full supercurrent  that its two separate pieces

and 
also represent conserved currents and therefore pointing to the fact
that there should exist
a higher symmetry group. In the light-cone coordinates
these currents have the form
N2generators 
G^1 _+ &=& 2^ _+  _+ X^ ,          
G^2 _+ = 2_+ ^  ^ _+ ,

G^1 _- &=& 2^ _-  _- X^ ,
          G^2 _- = 2_- ^  ^ _- .
Mode expansion of these currents is defined as:
G^1 _n   &=&  <e^in^+  G^1 _+  >=
_l  _n-l  c_l  

G^2 _n   &=&  <e^in^+  G^2 _+  >=
_l  _n-l  d_l 
therefore



These conserved currents form the following algebra
 [L_n , G^1 _m ] &=& (n2 -m)
G^1 _n+m ,                              (J=3/2)

 [L_n , G^2 _m ] &=& (n2 -m)
G^2 _n+m ,                              (J=3/2)

 G^1 _n , G^1 _m  &=&  0,        

 G^2 _n , G^2 _m  &=&  0.
Here J denotes the conformal spin of the corresponding operators.
The anti-commutator 
cannot be computed in closed form
unless we introduce additional current
u1current 
T_a  = 12    ^  _a ^ 
which appears to be also conserved as it is easy to check
using equations of motion. This conserved
current is connected with the 
invariance of the action which rotates
fermionic fields. Its components are


 and mode expansion is
 T_n   =  <e^in^+  T_+  > = -_l :c_n-l  d_l : .
Then we can compute the anti-commutator:



and the rest of the algebra will take the form:
 [L_n , T_m ] &=&  -m T_n+m  ,     (J=1)

 [T_n , T_m ] &=& D n _n+m,0  

 [T_n , G^1 _m ] &=& -G^1 _n+m          

 [T_n , G^2 _m ] &=& +G^2 _n+m 
It is clear now that this is a well known  superconformal
algebra and that initially implemented
 SUSY transformation has been naturally enhanced
to  world-sheet supersymmetry. This symmetry can
also be seen if one introduces the  superfield as
follows
X ^ (,_1 , _2) =
X^  +  _1 ^ + _2 ^ 
 + _2 _1 ^ 

=X^  +  _1 ^  +_2  (^ 
 +  _1 ^ ).
The important point is that there is no natural extensions of the
superfield   to  superfield,
simply because the constrain  breaks the symmetry
between  and  fields. This can be seen
as a sign that actually the whole system together with constraints
breaks the  down to .
This observation makes the computation of critical
dimension more subtle here. In particular it is not obvious at all that
it should be two, as it is the case for  strings.

Let us now consider the  new superconstraints (II) ()
which appear in our case :

^ _n,l  = <e^in^+ + il^-  :^  ^ _  :>
or in terms of oscillators
susyconstraints 
^+ _0,0  &=&  m ec_0 + _n 0 
 _-n  c_n ,      ^- _0,0  =  m ec _0
+ _n 0    _-n  c _n ,

^+ _n,0  &=& i_l 0,n 
_n-l c_l ,              
^- _0,n  =i _l 0,n 
 _n-l c _l  ,     n=1,2,...

^+ _n,l  &=&  _n c _l ,                        
^- _n,l  =   _n c_l ,    n,l=1,2,...
The important fact which uniquely defines the spectrum of this
superstring theory is again the  dependence of the operators 
and 
&(^2 -m^2) = k^2  ^2 + 2m e k  
+   k_oscil   +  m^2( e^2 -1)+
2m e _oscil +^2 _oscil  ,

&_+ = (c_0k  + k_+ oscil  ) + m ec_0  + m e _+ oscil  +
_oscil _+ oscil ,

&_- = (c _0k  + k_- oscil  ) + m ec _0  + m e _- oscil  +
_oscil _- oscil .
The first operator diverges quadratically with 
and the second one linearly in bosonic sector and we have linear
divergency of first operators in fermionic sector. Therefore in order to have
normalizable states in physical Hilbert space
one should impose corresponding constraints.
We are enforced to define the physical Hilbert space as
k^2   _phys  =0,   c_0k _phys  =
0,   c _0k _phys  =0,                       

k _n    _phys  =0,   k  _n   _phys  =0,   
   
k c_n    _phys  =0,   k c _n   _phys  =0,     n>0 ,

e k  _phys  =0.                                               
All these constraints can naturally be grouped  into three systems
of equations. The first three equations
are nothing else but massless  Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations
and uniquely define the spectrum of the theory.
We conclude that all physical states with integer and half
integer spins are massless . This is consistent with
tensionless character of the theory. The second system of equations
imposes important condition of transversality on fermion
and boson oscillators.  Finally the last equation
suggests that the  vector  should be interpreted
as polarization vector transverse to the momentum vector .

We should  impose  the constraints of 
superconformal algebra
last 
(L_0 +a )_phys  &=&0

L_n _phys &=&0,       n=1,2,.. 

T_0 _phys &=&0        

T_n _phys &=&0,      n=1,2,.. 







G^1 _n _phys &=&0,      n=1,2,.. 

G^2 _n _phys &=&0,      n=1,2,..
together with the additional constraints  ()
and fermionic constraints ()





^ _n,l _phys &=&0,     n,l =0,1,2,...
One should study in great details this Hilbert space
in order to learn more about content of the theory
and to prove the absence of the negative norm states.
We cannot also say anything certain about critical
dimension of the model because we  have additional
symmetries and the corresponding constraints, the influence of which
on the calculation of the critical dimension at the moment is not
quite well understood.

In the rest of the article we shall consider a
close topological model which
can be constructed by twisting
. Indeed the
redefinition of the energy momentum tensor by the total derivative
of the U(1) current, leads to the topological theory.
By this twisting operation the above 
supersymmetry transforms into BRST
symmetry  as in.


Twisted Topological Strings 

We shall obtain the topological version of the above 
theory by the redefinition of the energy momentum tensor T by
 as follows:



where  is the U(1) current ().
In light-cone components we have
T _++ &=&2_+ ^  _+ X^  +
i ^ _+  _+ ^ _+ ,        
T _- = 2_- ^  _- X^ +
i ^ _-  _- ^ _-  , 

F_+ &=& 2_+ ^  ^ _+  +
2^ _+ _+ X^ ,          
F_-  =2_- ^  ^ _- +
2^ _- _- X^ ,

J_+ &=& - ^ _+ ^ _+ ,                              
J_- = - ^ _- ^ _- ,
Substituting solutions () into  the last formulas one can get
T _++ &=&1 2  _+ ^ _L  _+ X^ _L +
i ^ _+  _+ ^ _+ ,

T _- &=&1 2  _- ^ _R  _- X^ _R 
+ i  ^ _-  _- ^ _- ,

F^1 _+ &=& _+ ^ _L ^ _+   +
^ _+  _+ X^ _L ,               

F^1 _- &=& _- ^ _R ^ _-  +
^ _- _- X^ _R ,

J_+ &=& - ^ _+ ^ _+ ,  

J_- &=& - ^ _- ^ _- ,
Mode expansion of these currents is defined as:
L_n   &=& <e^in^+  T _++  >= _l :_n-l  _l :
+_l : l   c_n-l  d_l : 

F^1 _n   &=&  <e^in^+  F_+  >=
_l _n-l  d_l   +
_l _n-l  c_l   

F^2 _n   &=&  <e^in^+  F^2 _+  >=
_l  _n-l  d_l   -
_l  _n-l  c_l   

J_n   &=&  <e^in^+  J_+  >=
-_l :c_n-l  d_l :
where we have introduced a new operator  which is
equal to the following expression
F^2 _+  = _+ ^ _L  ^ _+  -
^ _+  _+ X^ _L .
The necessity of introducing this operator comes from
the fact that again when we compute the algebra between
operators   the
algebra is closed only if we introduce this new
operator. For these four operators the algebra is closed
[L_n , L_m ] &=& (n-m) L_n+m ,

 [L_n , F^1 _m ] &=& (n2 -m) F^1 _n+m 
- n2  F^2 _n+m ,

 [L_n , F^2 _m ] &=&  (n2 -m) F^2 _n+m 
- n2 F^1 _n+m  ,

 [L_n , J_m ] &=&  -m J_n+m  - D 2 n(n+1)_n+m,0 , 

 [J_n , J_m ] &=& D n _n+m,0  

 [J_n , F^1 _m ] &=& F^2 _n+m          

 [J_n , F^2 _m  ] &=& F^1 _n+m             

 F^1 _n , F^1 _m  &=&2L_n+m  +(n+m)J_n+m 
+ D  n^2_n+m,0  

 F^1 _n , F^2 _m   &=&         -(n-m)J_n+m 
+ D  n  _n+m,0 

 F^2 _n   , F^2 _m    &= &
-2L_n+m  -(n+m)J_n+m  - D  n^2_n+m,0 
There is no defined conformal dimensions for the fermion operators
 and , they also do not have defined charges with respect
to the  group. As it is easy to see the linear combination
of these operators do have defined charges. Indeed
we should introduce the linear combination of supercurrents as
we did in  the previous model
2G_n = F^1 _n - F^2 _n ,     2 Q_n =  F^1 _n + F^2 _n ,
in order to have diagonal form of supercurrent with respect to the
conformal operator . In coordinate space they look as ().
For these conserved currents
the algebra takes the form
[L_n , L_m ] &=& (n-m) L_n+m ,                        (J=2)

 [L_n , G_m ] &=& (n-m) G_n+m ,                        (J=2)

 [L_n , Q_m ] &=&  -m Q_n+m ,                              (J=1)

 [L_n , J_m ] &=&  -m J_n+m  - D 2 n(n+1)_n+m,0      (J=1)

 [J_n , J_m ] &=& D m _n+m,0  

 [J_n , G_m ] &=& -G_n+m          

 [J_n , Q_m ] &=& +Q_n+m             

 G_n , G_m  &=&  0,        

 Q_n , Q_m  &=&  0,        

 G_n , Q_m  &= & L_n+m  +mJ_n+m  + D2 n(n+1)_n+m,0 
which is well known in topological conformal field theory.
One can see that we have here zero central charge and two nilpotent
fermion operators  and  which form the N=2 world-sheet supersymmetry.
Two conserved supercurrents which appear above should
have come from the explicit fermion symmetry of the theory. As we shall see
in a moment these symmetries can be justified.
One can check that the system is invariant under fermion
transformation laws  and  defined as
follows:
      
     
 
The  algebra of these fermionic symmetries
is nilpotent and is very similar to BRST transformations
brst 
_ _     (H)  =
 _  _    (H)=
0,     (_   _   -
 _  _  )  (H)=0.
where H is any of the fields .
From () it follows that the action is invariant under
fermionic symmetries (). We can compute  the
current corresponding to this fermion symmetry.
The variation of the action is
S  = 2  d^2  -2 i_+ ^ _- 
_+ _- X^  -i_+ ^ _- ^ _+ 
+i^ _- _+ (-2_+ _- X^ ) 

-(1/2)(-2i_+ _- ^ _+ )^   =
-2i  d^2  G_-   _+ (_+ )
and supercurrent 
coincides with the one which appeared in the previous section.
The important fact now is that the Lagrangian is
a variation of the super-potentials  and 
W = ^  _+ ^ _-  +
12 ^ _+  F^ ,     
W  =  ^  _- ^ _+  -
12 ^ _-  F^ ,
so that
W = _+ L ,                           
   W  =_- L .
It is also true that there exists a potential 
such that
 V= -i_+  W ,    
     V =  i _-  W,     V= 12 ^  F^ ,
thus




The constrains (II) can  also be represented
by the  transformation and therefore the full
Lagrangian in () can be represented as
2_+ _- L _tot 
=  i     (  ^  F^ 
+ (^2 -m^2)   ).
Thus the action can be represented as BRST commutator
.
The above fermion symmetry allows to express some important operators
as variation of others. In particular the energy momentum tensor
is a variation of second supercurrent , but only up to the total
derivative of  current 
  Q_+ &=&-2_- T_++ 
+ 2i_-_+ J_+   ,

 Q_- &=&-2_+ T_-   + 2i_+_- J_-   ,
Instead, the supercurrent  introduced above is total variation of the
vector 
  v_+ &=&i_- G_+ ,            v_+
= 2^ _+  X^ 

 v_- &=& i_+ G_- ,            v_-
= 2^ _-  X^ .
Let us consider the second fermion symmetry of the action
      
     
 
The  algebra of these fermionic symmetries
is nilpotent and is very similar to BRST transformations
brst2 
_ _     (H)  =
 _  _    (H)=
0,     (_   _   -
 _  _  )  (H)=0.
where H is any of the fields .
Let us compute  the corresponding
current. The variation of the action is
S  = 2  d^2  -2
^ _+ _- (-i_-  ^ _+ )
+2i_- _+ ^ _- ^ _+ 
+

i^ _- _+ (-_- F^ ) -(1/2)F^ 
(-2i_- _+ ^ _- )
=
-2i  d^2  Q_+   (_- _- )
and  also
appeared in the previous section.
The important fact now is that the energy momentum tensor is BRST commutator
with respect to the second fermion symmetry
 G_+   &=&  (2^ _+ _+ X^ )   =
2_-  T_++ ,    

 G_-   &=&  (2^ _- _- X^ )   =
2_+  T_- ,
and supercurrent  ia a variation of  current 
 J_+   &=&  (-^ _+ ^ _+ )   =
-_-  Q_+ ,

 J_-   &=&  (-^ _- ^ _- )   =
-_+  Q_- 
Thus the energy momentum tensor is a BRST commutator
 and its central charge vanishes,
the model transforms into topological theory.
