A highly excited (closed or open) string state on the leading Regge trajectory 
can be represented by a rotating soliton solution. There is
a semiclassical probability per unit cycle that this string can spontaneously
break into two pieces.
Here we find the resulting solutions for the outgoing two pieces, 
which describe two specific excited string states, and show that this semiclassical picture  reproduces very accurately 
the features of the quantum calculation of decay in the large mass  limit.
In particular, this picture prescribes 
the precise analytical relation of the masses  and  of the decay
products, and indicates that the lifetime of these string states 
grows with the mass as  , in agreement with the 
quantum calculation.
Thus, surprisingly,  a string with maximum angular momentum becomes 
more stable for larger masses.
We also point out some interesting features of the evolution  after
the  splitting process.

Introduction 












The study of the decay properties of massive string states, and, in particular, 
the attempt to determine their
lifetime, was initiated long ago, with various kinds of  results   
sometimes finding a long lifetime (see e.g.). 
The main difficulty is represented by the high degeneracy of the decay products,
even for the splitting into two bodies, which can be taken 
to be the first step of the decay process.  


Here we present a simple classical computation, which is applicable

for large quantum numbers, describing the splitting into two pieces of 
a very massive closed string in the state of maximal, and thus very large, 
angular momentum. This computation prescribes a definite relation between the 
masses of the decay products and also gives informations about their angular momentum.
Moreover, the semiclassical argument indicates that the lifetime for the splitting
of such highly excited states will grow proportional to its mass.

We will also compare the results of this semiclassical picture  with the detailed
quantum computation that we recently performed on the decay of a
 massive state with maximal angular momentum in closed superstring theory .
The quantum computation
was based on evaluating the imaginary part of the one-loop self-energy of that state.

The self-energy is expressed as an integral of a certain combination of theta functions,
and we developed a very efficient algorithm to derive the contribution of 
the intermediate states of definite mass, which included the sum over their degeneracies.
  



The comparison will show a surprisingly good agreement 
between the semiclasssical and quantum calculation,
despite the fact they involve completely different computations.



A striking result is  that very massive states of maximal
angular momentum can be long lived, the lifetime being proportional to their mass.
While the quantum computation was performed so far in ten flat uncompactified
dimensions,  the semiclassical computation appears to be independent of possible
compactifications. Thus, long-lived very massive string states could be present in the 
description of spacetime based on string theory. 






Splitting of a rotating string  



The rotating closed string solution is given by:
X=L (2) (2 )  ,   Y=L(2 )(2)  ,    X^0=2L ,
where . This represents a spinning folded closed string with maximum angular momentum.
The coefficient  in  is fixed  by the constraint
 (the other constraint  is also satisfied).
The string has energy and angular momentum given by
E=M=L'  ,     J=L^22,
so that one has the usual Regge relation .


The closed string () contains two segments, the "upper" 
segment described by  and the "lower" 
segment described by . The full length 
of the string is . We assume that at  the string 
splits into two pieces of lengths  and , 
 
with . The initial conditions for the strings I and 
II are given by the string () at . 
 The splitting occurs at 
for the upper segment, with  defined as
a-L_ L  ,     0<a<1 .
 For the lower segment, the splitting is at .
Thus the initial conditions are: 
X^_(,0)=X^(, 0) ,   
X^_(,0)=X^(, 0) ,
for  (upper segment) and 
for  (lower segment),
while for the string II we have
X^_ (,0)=X^(, 0) ,   
X^_ (,0)=X^(, 0) , 
for  (upper segment) and   
for  (lower segment).
These boundary conditions uniquely determine the solution
describing the two closed string final states.

We shall determine the solution describing the two outgoing solutions
in two different ways: 

a) By explicitly finding the Fourier modes. This will show, in particular,
that the outgoing strings are in a highly excited state which is not of
maximum angular momentum.

b) By a direct matching with the original solution and imposing the new
periodicity. By construction, the resulting solutions
coincide with the explicit calculation of a), and thus this method provides a 
simple closed analytic formula for the
resummation of the Fourier expansion. This form of the solution also exhibits the
nature of the motion of the outgoing strings I and II.


Fourier analysis 



Let us consider the string I. To find the explicit solution,
 we start with the general solution to the string equations 
for the closed string. The condition () can be equivalently imposed 
in the interval ,
since the original solution is periodic in  with period .
The most general closed string solution satisfying the periodicity condition 
 is given by
X_(,)=x_0 + 2p_^x a +
i _n0  ( x_n e^-2i na (-) +
x_n e^-2i na (+)  )  ,
Y_(,)=y_0 + 2p_^y a  +
i _n0  ( y_n e^-2i na (-) +
y_n e^-2i na (+)  )  .
Note that the constraints



are satisfied automatically once we impose the initial conditions. 
Indeed,  they are satisfied at , because there
the solutions  and their first derivatives
coincide with the original solution , which already satisfies the constraints.
Since they are a constant of motion, then they are satisfied for all 
(using the fact that , one sees that
the condition  at  implies that they vanish for any ). 



 Let us first 
 determine the conserved quantum numbers, energy, linear momentum and
angular momentum of each string. Since they are conserved 
quantities, they can be found at , where the solution is 
given by eq. (), (). The energy  and  linear 
momentum components are given by 

E_&=& 22
 _0^a2    d X^0_=La  ,

 
p_^x &=& 0 , 


p_^y &=& 22  
_0^a2  d Y_4L2
_0^a2   d (2)=L(a)
  . 
There is an extra factor of two in the above expressions, which takes into account 
that there are two segments of string giving the same contribution.
The angular momentum is 

J_22
a2   (X_Y_X_
Y_)=L^2a2 (1+(2a)2
a ) . 

This has an orbital component  and spin 
component . Since , the orbital component is just 
, where  is the center of mass 
coordinate of the string I, 

x_0 =2
a _0^a2   d X_=L(a)a 
 =a  p^y_ .

Therefore  with 

l_L^2a  ^2(a)(a)^2   ,    
S_=L^2a2 (1- 2^2(a)(a)^2  
+(2a)2a )  .

The mass of the string I 
is thus given by 

M^2_E_^2- p_^2=L^2
( a^2 - ^2(a)^2  )  .


Let us now 
determine the oscillator modes.  From the conditions 
, , it follows 
that 

x_n=x_-n  ,     y_n=-y_-n  . 

To 
find , , we multiply the two remaining boundary conditions 
,  by 
 and perform the integral over  from 
 to  , using the expansions 
(), () and the solution (). We find 

X_L(a)a  ( 1+2_n=1 ^
(-1)^n1-n^2a^2    (2na )  
(2na ) )  ,
 


Y_L(a)a  ( 2+2a _n=1 ^
(-1)^nn(1-n^2a^2 )   (2na )  
(2na ) )  ,
 

where  (note that the factor 
 can be removed byshifting  so that
 ).
Finally, we have 
.

Let us now consider the string II.
The solution is readily found by noting that the Fourier analysis become the same in terms of
  and .
We have to take into account that the shift in  produces a change of sign in the solution 
().
We get
X_L(a)(1-a)  ( 1+2_n=1 ^(-1)^n1-n^2(1-a)^2    
(2n(1-a) )  (2n(1-a) ) )
Y_L(a)(1-a)  ( 2+2(1-a) _n=1 ^
(-1)^nn(1-n^2(1-a)^2 )   (2n(1-a) )  (2n(1-a) ) )
with , and .

The conserved quantities for the 
string II are

E_  
=L(1-a)  ,    p_ ^y=-L(a)
   ,


J_ =l_ +S_  ,     
l_ =L^2(1-a)  ^2(a)((1-a))^2   
, 


S_ =L^2(1-a)2 (1- 
2^2(a)((1-a))^2  - (2a)2
(1-a) )  ,

M^2_ = E_^2- p_^2=L^2
( (1-a)^2 - ^2(a)^2  )  .
One easily checks that energy, linear momentum and angular momentum
are conserved in the process of splitting,
E_+E_=L' =E ,    p_^y+p_^y=0 ,     
J_+J_L^22.
We stress that the outgoing strings represent excited string states which do not 
have maximum angular momentum.





 For completeness, we also give the results in the case of open strings. 
The solutions are simply obtained by the formal substitution  
in eqs. (), () - (),
with the new  defined in the intervals  
and , respectively. 
The expressions for 
are the same as above with an extra factor 1/2, and similarly for the string II.




Closed formulas for the outgoing string solutions 


 

We can describe the classical closed-string dynamics by means of left and right motion,
in terms of the coordinates :
X^ (,)=X^ _+ (^+ )+X^ _- (^- )  .
 
The constraint is .

The initial string () 

is described by:
X_ (^)=L2 (2^) ,   Y_ (^)=L2 (2^) ,    
X^0_ (^)=L ^ . 
As before, .  








At   the string splits into two pieces:
.
The two pieces are folded like the initial string and the splitting occurs 
at  in the upper segment and at  in the lower segment,
with . The two resulting strings are determined as in the previous subsection
by requiring continuity
of the string coordinates and their first derivatives in  at , and by requiring 
periodicity in :    with period  and  
 with period .

The resulting expressions for  are the sum of two terms.
One term corresponds to the momentum carried by the string:  
. 
The other term is periodic in  and its derivative in  has zero average.


It is convenient to rescale the world-sheet parameters of the resulting strings
 for the string , 
and  for
the string , in such a way that the period is 
for both. 

We get for the string :
X^0_ (^)&=&L a^ ,


X_ (^)&=&L2 C_(^)  , 
Y_ (^)=L2 [ 2(a) ^+S_(^)]
where
&C_()&=(2a)  ,   S_()=(2a)-2(a) 

&for &    0< 2   , 

&C_()&=(2a ,   S_()=(2a)-2(a) (-)
 

&for &   2 <  . 
Similarly for the string  we get:
&&X^0_ (^)=L (1-a)^ ,


&&X_ (^)=L2 C_ (^)  , 


&&Y_ (^)=L2 [ -2(a) ^+S_ (^)]  
 
where
&&C_ ()=(2(1-a)+ a)  ,  

 
&&S_ ()=(2(1-a)+ a)+2(a) 


 &&for     0<  .
These definitions are extended to any  by declaring that  




These expressions automatically satisfy the constraints.
By construction, these solutions are equivalent to the solutions given by 
the Fourier expansion in the previous section (one can also check this numerically).


The derivative in  of both  and  
has a discontinuity
at  and  respectively. 
This discontinuity will appear as an angular bending  in the
(folded) shape of the strings  and . Since , this angular
bending will
move along the string, as a function of .
We will return to this point in the last section.



Comparison with the superstring  quantum calculation 


The decay process described above by semiclassical splitting predicts that masses will 
be related by the following formulas:

M_M_(a)= La^2 - ^2(
a)^2    ,

M_ =M_ (a ) =L
 (1-a)^2 - ^2(a)^2    .
These relations define a function .
 
In ref. ,
the full quantum calculation of the decay was done in the ten dimensional type II superstring theory.
The decay rate is obtained by extracting the imaginary part of
the genus one self-energy of the massive particle:
. 

This calculation is complicated: it combines expansions of theta functions and resummations, 
saddle-point   evaluation of some integrals. Nevertheless, it is an exact genus one result 
in the large  limit, since the only approximation involved are saddle-point approximations, 
which become exact as . 

Here we explain briefly the idea of the method and the result. 
We compute the contribution to  of the decay channel 
corresponding to the states with masses : let us call  
 that contribution per unit  .
The one-loop self-energy, derived first in, 
is represented as an integral of some combination of theta functions, 
the integration being over the torus complex modulus and over a complex 
(vertex position) coordinate on the torus surface. The integration is formally divergent,
and it is computed by a standard analytic continuation. 

A key point is to write the integrand as a sum of holomorphically factorized quantities.
The selection of a particular decay channel corresponds to a particular
 term in the Taylor expansion of the holomorphic factors, as it is recognized
by comparison with field theory Feynman diagrams. 
Cauchy contour integrals and  saddle point techniques 
are used for getting the holomorphic expansion, similarly to the well known
procedure for computing the entropy of a state in string theory.    
In this way we obtained:
d^2Im (M^2)dM^2_1dM^2_2 M^-3 [2M^2 S_0(M_1/M,M_2/M)] ,
with  (given in fig. 1 of). 



Therefore in the large mass limit the dominant decay channel corresponds to values 
of 
for which , i.e. the masses of the 
decay products are correlated, modulo processes which are 
exponentially suppressed. 
This effect may come as a surprise, 
since one might have expected a sizable string vertex coupling
three string states of arbitrary masses .

Figure 1 shows the relation , 
corresponding to , found numerically in (and shown there in fig. 3).. 
In the same figure, 
we have superposed the analytic function  
defined by (), ().
We see that they 

coincide, the analytic semiclassical curve fully matches the curve ofobtained by a one-loop calculation.


 
figure=semicl.eps,height=7truecm  




The curve  defined by eqs. (), ().
It is superposed with the similar curve obtained in from the direct
quantum one-loop calculation. 


This precise match is also surprising.
Although one expects that for a  large mass  the initial highly 
excited quantum string state is well described by a classical solution, 
it is not a priori obvious that the precise relation 
between masses should be implied  by a classical spontaneous splitting process.
Moreover, the decay products are not states of maximum angular momentum and it is not obvious 
that a semiclassical description would be applicable for them. 
The accurate coincidence of the two curves in figure 1 also confirms the results of.







Further, in the calculation of, it is also possible to isolate the contribution 
of a given orbital angular momentum . In fact, by
comparison with the field theory expressions for one-loop 
Feynman diagrams, one learns that the sum over  the possible
  contributions  corresponds to the sum over the holomorphically factorized terms
(in eq. (5.4) of, a term with given  has 
).

However,  is not a quantum number of the final states,
and in fact the quantum computation of  is expressed as the modulus 
square of a sum over amplitudes which are alternating in sign.
Therefore, the classical value of  does not correspond to a well defined
mean value.  In order to compare the quantum computation with the classical
configuration of outgoing states  with given , 
we have taken as quantum value of   the one for which
the amplitude is maximal in absolute value.
That maximal amplitude corresponds  to a value of  which depends on . 
We take the relevant values for  to be those along the curve of
Figure 1,  and then compare this result to  
computed semiclassically (see eqs. (), () ). 
This comparison is shown in Figure 2. 


 
figure=lzero3.eps,height=7truecm  


Plot of the classical (dashed line) and quantum (solid line) value for
 ( = orbital angular momentum) 
as a function of the parameter 
 (which defines the breaking point of the string).  








We see that the two curves are  quite close.


We think that the small discrepancy is due 
to the fact that there is not a well defined quantum value of . 
It is still remarkable that the semiclassical and quantum calculation give  
so close results, with the correct normalization which comes 
automatically without any tuning.



Decay rate and description of the motion 


There is a simple semiclassical argument which gives directly the
decay rate.

Consider the rotating string (). The solution is periodic
with period .



The probability of splitting per cycle is by definition proportional to the string coupling .
Thus, the total decay rate per unit time is given by
=probability per cycle period   = const.   
g_s^22L = const.  g_s^2M   .
Thus the lifetime of a massive string with maximum angular momentum is given by
T = ^-1 = const.  'g_s^2  M .
This result for the lifetime  coincides with that of the quantum calculation 
performed in:
in fact this is what is obtained by computing   
as the sum over 
of the result (). 
Thus, a classical estimate confirms the surprising result of, that is 
a string with maximum angular momentum becomes more stable the more massive it is.


Let us also remark that, independently of any computation, a strictly classical
estimate for the string lifetime can only be , because  is the
only time scale of the classical string (in units ); indeed the classical
string solution does not know  nor , which only appear in the 
interpretation of classical parameters as quantities having dimensions of energy, like
for instance . An exponential factor containing  in the denominator
of the exponent can be expected in a semiclassical computation. In fact, this is the
form of our result, the sum over  of (): 
T =  const. L [-2L^2Max ] .
We have seen that in general  and that the maximum of   
corresponds to the classical solution for which .


Having the exact semiclassical solutions for the outgoing strings I and II, 
it is interesting to describe the main features of their motion.
Figures 3 and 4 are  plots of a sequence of pictures of the string I 
and II after the splitting, for different breaking points: ,  respectively.
We see that the outgoing closed string remain folded, exhibiting a rotating motion.
The figures 3 and 4 were made using the Fourier series formulas of section 2.1.
One can check  that the same plot is obtained using the
formulas of section 2.2.
Figures 5,6,7 are a plot of the world-sheet for the breaking point at .





The most salient feature that can be observed from the figure is that  
the breaking of the strings creates  an angular bending, or kink, which 
then travels back and forth all along each string.
Remarkably, each string is straight except at the bending point.
One might wonder whether this feature is generic, at least 
for the breaking of an open string:
the kink is produced by the jump of the first derivative at the splitting point; it
is locally created, thus its
occurrence should not depend on whether the string has maximum angular momentum 
(i.e. whether it is straight or  curved).


Another important feature is that the angles of the bendings of the strings I and II
sum up , and they are given by
_= a ,    _ .

Note that they are in relation with the energies of the strings.
When   both angles are .



The formulas () can be proved by using the solutions of section 2.2.
Consider the string I at a given instant . 
The derivative  has the same discontinuity in both upper 
and lower segments of the closed string. In one segment the discontinuity
 originates from the discontinuity in  at 
. In the other segment, it originates 
from the discontinuity of 
 at .

 For , the bending angle  of the string I is an acute angle.
It can be computed in particular at , where it is given by
_dY_dX_ __1- 
 -dY_dX_ __1+   .
Using the explicit form of the solutions, we obtain




dY_dX_ __1+  = (2a ) .
Thus
_=a .
Similarly, one finds  as in ().
