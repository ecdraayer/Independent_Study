Some methods of the "unfolded dynamics" machinery particularly useful
for the analysis of higher spin gauge theories are summarized.
A formulation
of  conformal  higher spin theories in  invariant space-time
with matrix coordinates  and its extension to  invariant
space-times are discussed.  A new result on the global characterizaton
of  causality of physical events in the  invariant space-time
is announced.








Introduction 

Higher spin (HS) gauge theories are gauge theories with tensorial gauge
symmetry parameters. In the Fronsdal's formulation ,
for a spin   totally
symmetric gauge field ,
the gauge parameter 
 is totally symmetric in its indices and
traceless . The field
 is double traceless
. (For other
equivalent approaches to HS massless field see, e.g., ).
For every spin  there
exists  a unique action with at most
two derivatives




invariant under the Abelian gauge transformations
_n_1n_s  (x)= _n_1 _n_2 n_s  (x)
,
_n =   x^n .
For  and 2 this reproduces the Maxwell theory and linearized
Einstein theory. Fields of half-integer spins are  described
analogously. Since the lower spin gauge theories with spins
 and 2 play a key role in the theory of fundamental
interactions it is  interesting to understand whether there is
some nontrivial theory behind spin  gauge fields,
the HS gauge fields.

There is a number of motivations for studying HS gauge theories.
 From supergravity perspective, this is interesting because theories
with HS fields may have more supersymmetries than the "maximal"
supergravities with 32 supercharges like  SUGRA .
Recall that the limitation that the number of supercharges is 
 is a direct consequence of the requirement that  for all
fields in a supermultiplet (see, e.g., ).   From
superstring perspective, most obvious motivation is due to
Stueckelberg symmetries in the string field theory , which
have a form of some spontaneously broken HS gauge symmetries.
Whatever a symmetric phase of the superstring theory is, Stueckelberg
symmetries are expected to become unbroken HS symmetries in such a
phase and, therefore, the superstring field theory has to become one
or another version of the HS gauge theory.  An important indication in
the same direction is   that string amplitudes exhibit
certain symmetries in the high-energy limit equivalent to the string
mass parameter tending to zero.  In all cases, the key issue is the HS
gauge symmetry.

Unusual feature of the interacting HS gauge theory is that unbroken HS
gauge symmetries do not allow flat space-time as a vacuum solution,
requiring nonzero space-time curvature with anti-de Sitter (AdS)
space-time as a most symmetric vacuum .  Recently, this
unusual property received
interpretation  in the context of the
AdS/CFT correspondence conjecture . In particular,
in  it was conjectured that HS gauge theories in
AdS bulk are duals of some conformal models on the AdS boundary in the
large  limit with  where  is the boundary
coupling constant, which is opposite to the limit 
studied within the original AdS/CFT correspondence
conjecture .  Again, this suggests that the HS gauge theory
has a good chance to be related to a symmetric phase of superstring
theory.  On the other hand an explanation why the HS gauge theory has
not been yet observed in the superstring theory may be just that no
complete formulation of the latter is still known in the AdS
background at the quantum level despite the progress achieved at the
classical level .

Properties of the HS theories can to large extent be revealed from the
structure of global HS symmetry algebras found originally
in  for the simplest HS model in . In  it
was realized that  HS algebras are certain star-product
algebras with spinorial generating elements, while in  it was
then conjectured that algebras of the same structure correspond to HS
models in higher dimensions.(Recently, analogous realization
  of the string field theory star product in terms of infinite set of
  oscillators carrying vector space-time indices was proposed
  in .)   The construction is as follows. Consider
oscillators  and  satisfying the commutation relations
[a_A, b^B ] = _A^B.
In HS applications, indices  are interpreted as
spinorial (then ). The HS fields are described by the gauge
potentials
dx^n _n (a,bx) =
_p,q  dx^n _n A_1 A_p  ^B_1 B_q  (x)
b^A_1  b^A_p  a_B_1  a_B_q 
taking values in the oscillator algebra.  The field 
 is the HS generalization of the frame field and Lorentz
connection in the Cartan formulation of gravity. The HS curvature and
transformation law have the standard Yang-Mills form with the
oscillator algebra in place of a Yang-Mills matrix algebra
R= d+,d = dx^n _n,
= d+
[,  ].
The HS gauge symmetry parameter  is an arbitrary
function of the space-time coordinates  and noncommutative
auxiliary variables  and , which admits an expansion
analogous to (). Since this expansion contains
infinitely many terms,       the HS algebra of oscillators is
infinite-dimensional. It contains however finite-dimensional
subalgebras. Important example is given by the subalgebra 
spanned by various bilinears in the oscillators
P_AB  = a_A a_B ,L_A ^B = a_A,  b^B
,K^AB  = b^A b^B 
and its superextension  with supercharges  and
.  Usual  and conformal symmetry algebras belong to
this . In particular,  algebra  is isomorphic
to . (The doubling which extends to the whole
 HS system  is introduced with the aid of additional
involutive element  () .) The 
conformal (equivalently ) algebra  is isomorphic to
. The  conformal (equivalently ) algebra 
is isomorphic to . For higher dimensions usual
space-time symmetry algebras are subalgebras of appropriate .
As was shown long ago in   provides a natural
simple superextension of the higher dimensional space-time symmetries.


The following important properties of the HS theories follow directly
from the structure of HS algebras.

Usual spin 2 gravitational fields take values in the algebra 
spanned by bilinears of the oscillators.  Higher spins are associated
with the higher order polynomials of the oscillators.  Because
higher-order polynomials do not close to a finite-dimensional algebra,
it follows that an infinite tower of HS fields should be included once
there is at least one HS field.

By virtue of the field equations, the quantum-mechanical nonlocality
of the HS algebra is translated to the space-time nonlocality of HS
interactions .  Since higher spins require higher
derivatives , the theory with infinite towers of higher
spins requires infinitely many derivatives.

More recent observation  we focus on in this report is
that, starting from , usual space-time symmetries in conformal HS
models extend to larger symplectic symmetries acting on the conformal
HS multiplets. We will see that this may affect considerably the
geometric picture of the world leading to new geometries with the so
called "central charge" coordinates included. This, however, does
not affect visualization of our world as a four-dimensional space-time
realized as a three-brane embedded into the ten-dimensional
generalized space-time with matrix coordinates.


 conformal free fields 
Consider a Fock vacuum state  satisfying
a_A 0= 0 and a set of functions taking values in the Fock space
(i.e., sections of the Fock fiber bundle over space-time)
(x) = C(bx) 0,C(bx)=_n=0 ^ 
1 n! 
C_A_1 A_n (x) b^A_1  b^A_n  .
To make contact with the description of  relativistic fields
in terms of two-component indices one replaces the index 
by a pair of two-component indices ,
(; )
and uses the equivalent expansion
C(b,b x)=_m,n=0 ^ 1 m!n! 
C__1 _m,_1 _n  (x) b^_1  b^_m 
b ^_1  b ^_n .
The key observation is that the set of all massless conformal
field equations in four dimensions can be formulated in the
following compact form D_0 (x) d (x) + _0
(x) =0,_0 = - dx^  a_a _.
Here   is the  Minkowski  frame 1-form and
 is  the gauge field associated with the
generators of translations realized as bilinear combinations of
mutually commuting oscillators. Note that analogous description of
 conformal fields was given in  (see also).


Equation () is equivalent to the equation
 x^   C(b,b x) - ^2 b^b ^ 
C(b,b x) =0,
which decomposes into independent subsystems associated
with different spins, singled out by the condition
(b^ b^  - b ^ b ^ )
C(b,b x) = 2s C(b,b x),
equivalent to
N (x) =2s (x) ,N= a_b^- a _b ^.
The fact that  massless field equations can be reformulated in the
form () was known long ago .  The dynamical
fields are those in the expansion (), carrying either only
dotted or only undotted indices. They are contained in the analytic
( and antianalytic () parts, and describe
scalar , spinor , spin 1
field strength 
 and so on for spins 3/2 and higher.  All components in
 which depend both on  and on  are
auxiliary being expressed by () in terms of space-time
derivatives of the dynamical fields. The nontrivial equations on the
dynamical fields are
(^2 b^x^  -
^2 b^x^   ) C(b,0x) =0,(^2 b ^x^  -
^2 b ^x^   ) C(0,b x) =0
for  and the Klein-Gordon equation for the spin zero scalar
field . These are the usual massless equations formulated in
terms of field strengths.  The simple observation  that
massless equations admit the described Fock space realization allows
us, with the help of the unfolded dynamics machinery, to reveal their
symmetries which turn out to be much richer than the usual conformal
symmetry of massless fields and, in particular, contain 
symmetry.

Unfolded dynamics 

Let  be some set of differential forms with 
(0-forms are included), and the generalized curvatures  be
defined by the relations
^a= dW^a +F^a (W),
where  are some functions of  built with the aid of the
exterior product of differential forms.  Given
 with vanishing 0-form part () which
satisfies the generalized Jacobi identity
F^b F^a  W^b  0,
we say following  that it defines a free differential
algebra. This property guarantees that the generalized Bianchi
identity  is satisfied,
which implies that the differential equations on  ^a =0
are consistent. These equations are invariant under
the gauge transformations
W^a = d ^a -^b
F^a  W^b ,
where  is an arbitrary form (0-forms
do not give rise to gauge parameters) because the generalized
curvatures transform as 
 Also,
since Eqs. () are formulated in terms of differential forms,
they are manifestly general coordinate invariant.  Elementary but
crucial fact is that any dynamical system can be "unfolded" to the
form () by introducing enough auxiliary fields. Note that in
such approach, the co-frame field  from which the metric tensor is
built is one of the 1-forms in the set . It is supposed to be
invertible, having a part of order 1 in any perturbative expansion.
This provides a meaningful linearization of Eq. ().

For the particular case when the set  consists of only 1-forms
, the function  is bilinear 
 and the relation () amounts to the Jacobi
identity for a Lie algebra  with the structure coefficients 
 (or superalgebra if some of  carry an additional
Grassmann grading).  If the set  also contains some -forms
 (e.g., 0-forms) and the functions  are linear in , 
 the relation ()
implies that the matrices  form some representation
 of  while () contains zero-curvature equations of 
R^i =d^i +  f^i_jk  ^j ^k =0
along with the covariant constancy equation
Dv^+ t_i ^ _^i v^=0
for the representation .  Thus the zero-curvature equation for some
Lie algebra  along with the covariant constancy conditions for a
set of differential forms taking values in some module over  give
the simplest example of a free differential algebra. Note that this
case is not necessarily dynamically trivial and can be used to
describe some not empty free field dynamics. Here the zero curvature
equation for gauge fields of  describes some -invariant
background geometry while the covariant constancy conditions can
describe free fields propagating in this geometry provided that the
representation  is infinite-dimensional.  For example, the free
massless equations ()  have
unfolded form. The connection  in () trivially
satisfies the zero curvature equation 
 because it is -independent and involves only mutually commuting
oscillators . In fact, instead of fixing  in the particular
form () it is enough to say that the frame part of  is
nondegenerate and the condition () is satisfied, that brings
us to the formulation of the dynamics of massless fields in an arbitrary
conformally flat background.


Equations () express exterior differentials of all fields 
 via values of the fields themselves. As a result, to reconstruct
 everywhere by virtue of () modulo gauge ambiguity
(), it is enough to fix values of  at any given
point(Of course, this is only true in a topologically trivial
  situation with trivial cohomology of the de Rahm differential .
  Otherwise further restrictions on  can occur.)   .
For this to be possible, the set of fields  must be rich
enough to describe all on-mass-shell nontrivial combinations of the
space-time derivatives of dynamical fields under consideration.  From
the Poincare' lemma it follows that nontrivial degrees of freedom are
contained in the 0-forms because all degrees of freedom in forms with
 are pure gauge, i.e., are fixed in terms of 0-forms modulo gauge
ambiguity.  Identification of field strengths with the 0-forms 
occurs in terms of some deformation of the zero-curvature equation of
the type () to
d++C +=0
which, in fact, is the starting point towards the full nonlinear
dynamics in the form () .  In HS gauge theories,
0-forms are described by the generating functions  analogous
to those of gauge potentials () but taking values in a
certain "twisted adjoint" representation of the HS algebra. In the
conformal model discussed in this talk, the set of "dynamical
fields"  and  also corresponds to all
on-mass-shell nontrivial combinations of the gauge invariant fields
strengths of massless fields.

Note that nontrivial deformations ()  sometimes
result from some zero-curvature and covariant constancy conditions
in a larger system
d= ,D= 0
provided that the 0-forms  satisfy some nonlinear
constraints
()=0,
being invariant in the sense that  as a consequence
of () (for more details and examples of HS gauge theories
formulated this way see ).  In this case the nontrivial
dynamical content of the equations is hidden in the constraints
().  The role of Eqs. (), which can be integrated
in the pure gauge form (at least locally), is to map the content of
the constraints () to the geometric framework associated with
the original coordinates . Such a formulation makes it trivial to
extend the dynamical equations to larger (super)spaces without
changing its dynamical content by simply adding extra coordinates 
and extending the differential forms to the extra dimensions
dx^n _n (x) dx^n _n(x,y) + dy^n^  _n^ (x,y) .
The dynamical content of the system (), ()
is still  encoded by the constraints () on the zero forms
 at any point, say , of a larger space-time. This trick
was suggested  in  where it was applied to the analysis
of the HS dynamics in the  invariant space-time as
we discuss below. More recently, it was applied
in  to derive the superspace form of the  HS equations
of . As discussed in  there is a great
variety of extensions of the HS dynamics to different space-times.
The invariant content to be intact is the constraints ()
.

Symmetries 
A nice feature of the unfolded formulation is that it makes symmetries
() manifest.  Suppose that some vacuum solution  of
() is fixed.  This restricts the gauge symmetry parameters by
the condition  equivalent to
 d ^a -^b
F^a  W^b _W=W_0 =0.
If the 0-form part of the l.h.s. of (),



,
is nonzero for a chosen solution, this imposes some restrictions
on the parameter . In many cases however  is such that
.
Choosing a solution with   one finds that for this case
the left hand side of Eq. () is only
nontrivial  in the sector of -forms with  which is
a consistent differential condition because
 . Therefore, it can be
integrated to fix  in terms of 
 at any given point  modulo
second rank "gauge symmetries" for gauge parameters




 From the Poincare lemma it follows that nontrivial leftover
symmetries are parametrized by the 0-form parameters among
. These are reconstructed uniquely in terms of their
values , which are
arbitrary parameters of the global symmetries of the system.
As a result, there are  as many global symmetries as
0-forms among  at any fixed ,
i.e., as 1-forms among .

Applying this machinery to the HS system in
Sec.  we observe that
the Fock space forms a module over the
 conformal algebra  realized by the generators
P_  = a_a _,K^  = b^b ^,L_ ^= a_b^-_^a_b^,L _ ^= a _b ^-_^a _   b ^  ,D=a_, b^ +a _, b ^.
The 1-form  in () is the flat connection
of the conformal algebra. According to the general
analysis, this proves that Eq. () is
conformally invariant. Since the conformal algebra 
belongs to the symplectic algebra 
() which, in its turn,
belongs to the infinite-dimensional HS algebra of all polynomials
of the oscillators which  acts on the Fock module,
from our analysis it follows that the set of
equations for massless fields of all spins contained in ()
has global symmetries which form these algebras. Thus the
infinite-dimensional algebra of polynomials of oscillators of 
and  is shown  to form a
symmetry of the system of equations of all massless fields that
extends the usual conformal symmetry. This confirms the conjecture
of Fradkin and Linetsky  that (an appropriate reduction
of) this algebra can be used as  conformal HS
algebra (these authors studied  a different
 conformal model being the HS extension of the
nonunitary  conformal gravity.)
Algebras of this type were used in  as  HS algebras.


The unfolding machinery provides
efficient tools for elucidating explicit form of
the transformation laws. For example, for the conformal HS system
in Sec. ,
the zero curvature connection
admits the pure gauge representation
_0 = g^-1  dg ,g = -x^  a_a _ .
Then, the global symmetry parameter that leaves 
invariant is
(a,a ,b,b x) = g^-1 (a,a ,b,b x)
 _0 (a,a ,b,b )g(a,a ,b,b x),
where  is an arbitrary -independent
element of the HS algebra of oscillators which parametrizes the
HS global symmetries. The transformation law for massless fields
is
= .  The parameters
 bilinear in oscillators describe the
 symmetry.  Those of higher orders describe HS symmetries.
Note that the parameters  being
order- polynomials in the oscillators give rise to some local
transformation laws with at most order  space-time
derivatives.  Formulas () and () allow one easily to
derive explicit form of the respective transformation laws .


  cohomology 


A useful tool of the unfolding machinery is the identification
of the dynamical content of unfolded equations with
certain cohomology groups. Consider a covariant constancy
equation of the form
(+_- +_+)C (X)= 0 ,
where   and  satisfy the relations
 (_)^2 =0,^2 +_-, _+ =0,
 , _ =0,
which guarantee that the connection is flat.  It is demanded that only
the operator , that contains the de Rahm differential, acts
nontrivially (differentiates) on the space-time coordinates while
 act in the fiber  in which  takes values. It is
also assumed that there exists a grading operator  diagonalizable
in  such that its spectrum in  is bounded from below and
[G, ] = 0,[G
,_] = _.
For example, the conformal equations () have this form with
, ,

 and

.
 In fact, it is a typical situation with
 realized as a space of polynomials of some auxiliary
variables, 
being some differential operators acting on these
auxiliary variables and  counting
a (nonnegative) polynomial degree that guarantees
that the spectrum of  is bounded from below.

The following useful facts are true.


(i) Dynamical fields contained in the 0-forms  take values in the
  cohomology group . In other words, dynamical fields
  in -space are those satisfying . This is
  because all fields in  (i.e., such that 
) are auxiliary being expressed via the space-time
  derivatives () of the dynamical fields by virtue of
  Eqs. (). Note that  is always nonzero
  because it at least contains the nontrivial subspace of  of
  minimal grade.



(ii) There are as many differential conditions on the dynamical
  0-forms  in Eq. () as elements of the cohomology group
  .  If grade  elements of  impose
  equations on grade  dynamical fields, an order of differential
  equations is .  All other equations in () are
  either constraints, which express auxiliary fields via derivatives
  of the dynamical ones, or consequences of the dynamical equations.
  When  is zero () is equivalent to some
  (usually infinite) set of constraints which express all fields
  contained in  via derivatives of the dynamical fields (which
  however have no dynamics in that case being restricted by no
  differential equations).



The proof is elementary .
Indeed, consider the decomposition of the space of 0-forms 
into the direct sum of eigenspaces of . Let a
field having definite eigenvalue  of  be
denoted , . Suppose that the dynamical
content of the equations () with the eigenvalues
 with  is found. Applying the operator 
to the left hand side
of  the equations () at   we obtain
taking into account ()
that
_- (( C_k_q+1  )) =0.
Therefore  is
 closed. If the group  is trivial
in the grade 
sector,  any solution of () can be written in
the form

for some  field . This,
in turn, is equivalent to the statement that one can adjust
 in such a way
that  or, equivalently, that the part of the
equation () of the grade  is some constraint
that expresses  in terms of the derivatives of 
(here the assumption is used that
the operator  is algebraic
in the space-time sense, i.e. it does not contain space-time derivatives.)
If  is nontrivial, this means that the equation
() sends the corresponding cohomology class to zero and,
therefore, not only
expresses the field  in terms of  derivatives of
 but also imposes some additional
differential conditions on .
All other equations in ()  either imply constraints
which express auxiliary fields via derivatives of the dynamical ones
or are consequences of the dynamical equations.





For example, for the system of massless fields () with
, 
consists of analytic and antianalytic functions giving rise to the
dynamical massless fields  and . The
dynamical equations () along with the Klein-Gordon
equation are associated with .



The following comments are now in order.



If  are -forms, dynamical fields and
nontrivial dynamical equations are associated
with  and , respectively.


Suppose that the symmetry algebra 
admits a triple  graded structure
 with Abelian subalgebras . Let
 where  is some basis in .
The dynamical fields satisfying
 then identify with the
primary fields in  satisfying .(Note
the roles of "translations" 
and "special conformal" generators  of  acting in the
fiber is exchanged  in the unfolded formulation
compared to the standard induced representation
approach  in which primaries are defined directly in
 the base manifold.)  In other words, 
consists of singular vectors (i.e., vacua) of various submodules
over  in , which is consistent since any invariant submodule
of  gives rise to a subsystem in ().

forms some representation of . In most interesting physical
applications  decomposes into (may be infinite)
direct sum of finite-dimensional representations of .
This corresponds to a model with dynamical fields carrying
finite dimensional representations of . Note that
for the case of usual conformal algebra,  consists of
the Lorentz algebra plus dilatations, i.e., dynamical fields are
some Lorentz tensors carrying definite conformal weights.


Suppose that . Let 
and  solve () with some operators
 and . Then
C_1,2  (X) = C_1 (X)C_2 (X)
solves () with



 If  and  form modules
over some symmetry algebra , the same is true for .
As a result, the unfolded formulation of the dynamical equations
equips the variety of solutions of
-quasiinvariant partial differential
equations with the natural associative product structure isomorphic
to the tensor algebra of (semiinfinite)
modules over . Note that this associative
structure differs from that of the ring of solutions
of first order differential equations. It maps solutions of
some set of (not necessarily first order) -quasiinvariant
partial differential equations to solutions of some other
-quasiinvariant equations. In fact, this property is deeply
related to the general  philosophy .



Field equations in  invariant space-time 


 According to the general argument in Sec. the set of massless equations of all spins
()
admits  symmetry realized by local field transformations.
Definite spin field equations are singled out by
the condition (). The operator  in ()
does not commute to the  generators,
breaking  down to the conformal algebra  which
is the centralizer of  in . The
 acts on every spin individually. The
generators in  mix different spins. There are
two irreducible subspaces of  in the set of massless fields
of all spins, those containing  bosons or fermions (they form
an irreducible representation of ). Note that
 the Fock representation of  used in our
construction is the nonunitary dual of the unitary Fock
(i.e., singleton) representation of . As explained in
 this duality has a form of some Bogolyubov transform.
That the unitary Fock representation of  reduces to
the collection of massless
representations of all spins of  was discussed, e.g., in
.


Our goal is to reformulate  dynamics of massless fields of all
spins in an equivalent but manifestly  invariant  form.
To this end we have to use a  invariant space-time.
As a minimum this
will give us a technical device analogous to superspace
in the context of supersymmetric theories.
Very likely, however, this generalization may have
much deeper effect on our understanding of the space-time
geometry. Since it is designed
for the description of just those sets of HS massless fields that
appear in consistent nonlinear HS theories, the proposed
formulation has a good chance to be related to a symmetric
phase of a theory of fundamental interactions.


Recall that the compactified Minkowski space-time is
the coset space
 where  is the parabolic subgroup of 
generated by special conformal, Lorentz and dilatation  generators.
Usual Minkowski space is the maximal cell of . Let us
proceed analogously with the symplectic group  choosing the
parabolic subgroup of  generated by the "special conformal"
generators  and Lorentz + dilatation
generators  in (). The dimension of the resulting
compactified generalized space-time  equals to
the number of translation generators in (), i.e., 
. Local coordinates are real symmetric
matrices . This space was discussed by many authors
in different contexts . It allows
the action of   realized by the vector fields
 P_AB = X^AB  ,L_A  ^B =X^BC  X^AC  ,K^AB =X^AC X^BD  X^CD  .
In this talk we will not distinguish between the
compactified space  and its maximal cell having trivial
topology of .

Let us now extend Eq. () to  with the
help of the unfolded formalism machinery.
This is achieved by means of the trick explained at the end of
Sec.  via replacing  () with
D_0 (X) d (X) +_-
(X) =0,
_- = - dX^AB  ^2 b^A b^B .
().
Decomposing   as
 with Hermitian
coordinates  of the usual Minkowski space-time
and additional mutually conjugated six coordinates  and

we find that this equation contains the original
 equation ()  along with the equations




and their conjugates. Clearly these new equations just reconstruct
the dependence on the additional six coordinates 
and  in terms of values of the original
fields in the  Minknowski space-time.

Now we are in a position to  analyse Eq. ()
directly in the ten dimensional space-time .
The analysis of its dynamical content
is elementary in terms of  cohomology.



Let us consider the case of arbitrary .
Obviously,  is spanned by at most linear polynomials
in , i.e., dynamical fields are
C^dyn  = b(X) + b^A f_A (X).
Here the scalar field  and spinor field 
in  describe, respectively, all massless boson and
fermion fields in the   Minkowski space-time in the case of
. It is not hard to see (explicit proof is given in )
that  is spanned by the elements of
the form


 and 
where    and 
are arbitrary tensors having symmetry properties of the
Young tableaux
 
and
 
, respectively.
The nontrivial equations on the dynamical fields, which
have these symmetry properties,
are  (
^2 X^AB  X^CD   - ^2 X^AC  X^BD  ) b(X) =0
for the boson field  and
  X^AB   f_C(X) -
 X^AC   f_B(X)      =0
for the fermion field .
These are analogues of the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations.
(For   they  coincide with the  massless equations.)
Note that every solution of () satisfies ().

As Eqs. () and ()
with  are equivalent to the
original  equations they are expected to respect nice
features of the original  system, such as unitarity, locality,
microcausality etc. It is instructive to reanalyse these
properties  starting directly from
Eqs. () and (). Once these are
linear equations one can analyze them via Fourier transform.
For a particular harmonic
b(X) = b_0 i k_AB X^AB 
 () requires
k_AB k_CD =k_AC k_BD .
This is solved by the twistor ansatz
k_AB  =k _A _B
with an arbitrary commuting real "svector"  and a factor .
For the proof it is enough to diagonalize the
symmetric matrix  by a  transformation to see that
the product of any two different eigenvalues is zero by  ()
at  and, therefore,
any nonzero matrix  satisfying () has rank 1.
 Modulo rescalings of  and ,
there are two essentially different options in (), with
 or . These correspond to the positive and negative
frequency solutions, respectively. The analysis of fermions is
analogous. As a result the generic solutions of () and
() have the form
b (X) =1 ^M 2   
d^M (b^+ () i  _A _B  X^AB 
+b^- () -i  _A _B X^AB  ) ,
f_C (X) =1 ^M 2   
d^M _C
(f^+ () i  _A _B  X^AB 
+ f^- () -i  _A _B X^AB  ) .
Both for the scalar  and svector ,
the space of solutions is parametrized by two
functions of  variables . Because odd functions
 and even functions
 do not contribute to ()
and (), respectively, we require  b^()=b^(-) ,f^()=-f^(-).  The integration in () and () is thus carried out over
. The origin of coordinates  is
invariant under the 
reflection , being a singular
point of the conical orbifold . Note that the whole
framework is supersymmetric as is manifested by the fact
that
bosons and fermions have equal numbers
of degrees of freedom  for any .


As shown in , the form of the general solution (),
() allows  manifestly  covariant quantization.
The commutation relations for quantized fields
equivalent to those in  and 
Minkowski space-time for  and , respectively,
are as simple as
[b^(_1), b^(_2)] =0,[b^- (_1), b^+ (_2)] =
((_1 - _2)+(_1 + _2)),
[f^(_1), f^(_2)]_+ =0,[f^- (_1), f^+ (_2)]_+ =
((_1 - _2)- (_1 + _2)),
while the Green function is .


Time 

Equations () and () describe propagation along
the generalized light-like directions 
 where  is a contravariant "svector".  The sign
choice here fixes a time arrow.  Suppose that a light-like signal
emitted from some point  of the generalized space-time
reaches some other point  switching
on a new process that emits a signal in a different light-like
direction(The assumption that a process can be switched on
  locally may or may not be true for particular dynamical equations.
  In fact, as discussed below, Eqs. () and () do not
  admit full localization in .  This does not affect our
  conclusions on the causal structure of the generalized space-time,
  however.) .  Provided this happens several times, any point X^AB  =_i=0 ^M  _i^A _i^B,
can be reached
where  is a complete set of contravariant svectors.
Formula () describes  generic
positive semi-definite symmetric matrix .

We  see that the relativistic geometry that follows
from Eq. () identifies the future
cone  of a point 
with the set of matrices  such that
 is
positive semi-definite. Time-like vectors
are described by positive definite matrices
X^AB _A _A >0_A. Light-like vectors identify with degenerate positive semi-definite
matrices.
We will distinguish between rank- light-like directions
described by matrices of rank . The
concepts of time-like and rank- light-like vectors are invariant
under the generalized Lorentz group .

Equation () describes propagation along the most degenerate
light-like directions of rank .  To work out a form of the
equations that describe propagation along less degenerate light-like
directions one can use the tensor product construction described at
the end of Sec. . As shown in , fold
tensor product of the Fock representation in Eq. () gives
rise to the field equations which describe propagation along rank 
light-like directions in .


The past cone  is defined analogously as the set of
negative semi-definite matrices
(X^AB -X_0^AB ) _A _B 0_A.
If  then  and
.
 is the convex cone: 

. Note that the analysis
of future and past cones in  was given in in a different context.


Let us now introduce a concept of space-like global Cauchy surface as
such a submanifold  of some (generalized) space-time manifold
 that

 
[] , 
  and  for .

[] any point of  belongs to either future or past cone
  of some point of . No point  can belong to the
  future cone of some point  and past cone of some
  other point .

In particular, the property  implies that no pair of observers on
 are allowed to exchange causal signals, i.e., a global Cauchy
surface is space-like.  Provided that  admits a fibration (or
rather foliation) into a set of space-like global Cauchy surfaces,
 parametrized by some parameter(s) , this defines the
concept of time(s).

Let  be some fixed  positive definite matrix.
The axioms  and  are satisfied with the
space-like global Cauchy surfaces  parametrized as
X^AB  _t :X^AB  = x^AB +tT^AB ,
where the space coordinates  are
arbitrary  traceless matrices
x^AB T_AB =0,T_AB T^BC  =_A^C.
Indeed, the difference of any two matrices
of the form () at fixed  is traceless and
therefore it is neither positive definite nor negative definite.
As a result, any two points of   at some fixed 
are separated by a space-like interval.
The rest of the axioms is a consequence of the trivial decomposition
() of a matrix into the sum of its trace and traceless parts.

An important output of this analysis is that
 has just one evolution parameter
t=1 M  X^AB  T_AB .
The ambiguity in the choice of a positive definite
matrix  parameterizes the ambiguity in the choice of a
particular coordinate frame like in Einstein special
relativity: any two positive definite
matrices  with equal
determinants are related by some
generalized  Lorentz transformation. The dilatation
allows one to fix a scale of time in an arbitrary way.
As shown in , 
generalized Lorentz transformations exhibit a lot of similarity
with the usual Lorentz transformations in Minkowski space-time including
nontrivial limits on relative speeds of reference frames.

Localization and Clifford algebra 


Using the ambiguity in  and 
in the general solutions () and ()
it is possible to fix their dependence in at most
 coordinates that, generically, is much less than
. In particular, it is impossible
to localize solutions in more than  coordinates.
This phenomenon is new
compared to the experience with the usual Minkowski space-time:
although fields live in  dimensional space-time
physical events occur in some
-dimensional subspace. This happens because
the equations are overdetermined and contain constraints
which do not allow
to focus the waves in more than 
dimensions. (Analogously, the Gauss law does not allow electric field
to be fixed arbitrarily  on the initial Cauchy surface
for a given charge distribution.)

It is useful to introduce  the concept of local
Cauchy bundle  as such  -dimensional
surface in  (or a limiting
surface with some of radii shrinking to zero) that the solutions
() and () are fixed by their values on .
Note that while the concept of global Cauchy surface is a
characteristics of  independent of  particular dynamics,
the concept of local Cauchy surface characterizes particular
dynamical equations in .
These two notions coincide in the Minkowski geometry
but turn out to be different in a more general framework.

Now one can address a question whether  there are some 
space-like coordinates
x^n = ^n_AB X^AB 
such
that, using the ambiguity in the functions , it is
possible to built  solutions of the field equations
proportional to (derivatives of)
the delta function 
at any point . For this to be possible, the
dual momenta  have to provide a
map of the orbifold  onto  with the only singularity
at . Then, by changing integration variables from 
to  plus, may be,  some other variables in case
, one can get delta functions 
by integrating over .

Remarkably, this can be achieved if the matrices
,
where  is the time axis matrix, satisfy Clifford
relations
^n, ^m  = 2^nm .
(This  is possible when the index  describes
a collection of some  spinors with .) Indeed,
an immediate consequence of
() is  that the matrices  are traceless



whenever , thus belonging to the global Cauchy surface.
Another important property is that the momenta
k_n () = _n^AB  _A_B
map the cone  onto , i.e., varying real twistor parameters
 it is possible to get arbitrary values of . This
results from the invariance of the construction under the space rotations
 generated by



By a space rotation one aligns a vector  along any
direction and then normalizes it arbitrarily by a rescaling of .
That momenta 
span  allows for localization of the fields in  space
 coordinates dual to , i.e., by means of integration over
, one can reach the delta-functional initial data
 localized at any point of the
physical space  .

Because the square of any linear combination of
  matrices is proportional to the unit matrix, for any vector
 there exists such a basis in the space of  that
T^AB = ^AB ,a^n _n^AB  =
a^2  Y^AB ,a^2 =a^n a^m _nm ,
where
Y= ( 
    )  with all four blocks being  matrices
( is assumed to be even). As a result,
(nondegenerate) space-time matrix coordinates of the form
^AB  = t T^AB  + x^n _n^AB 
can only have three values of the inertia index

 for 


 for 

and

 for 

where



This corresponds to the standard space-time picture with the
future cone (), past cone () and the space-like
region (). This property of space Clifford coordinates
implies microcausality in terms of the coordinates  of the
usual space-time .
(Note that the condition that  can take
in the linear space of matrices of the form ()
only maximal value  (future), minimal value 
(past) or some fixed  intermediate value
 for all values of  and 
can be taken as an alternative definition leading to
 the -matrix
relations .)

A new comment we would like to make here is
that the Clifford  realization of
coordinates of local events provides a global
characterization of causality. Consider
two events characterized by local space-time coordinates ()
 and .  A
solution of the field equations localized
at  is characterized by some function  of
X^AB = ^AB  +^AB 
with the dependence in  localized at 
(i.e., being proportional to some derivatives of
) but not necessarily
localized in the rest
traceless coordinates  orthogonal to

^AB  _nAB  =0,T^AB  _nAB  =0.
The question is whether it is possible that  is
space-like
while  is time-like for some  .
Remarkably, the answer is negative (otherwise, causal
relationships beyond the usual local coordinate Minkowski
picture would be possible). Namely,
let , be some
points where solutions corresponding to some two different
events are nonzero. If 
the Clifford local coordinates
 characterizing these solutions
are in the same causal relationship
(for any choice of Clifford coordinates). This fact guarantees
that the concept of causality has global meaning and
is fully characterized by the causality
of local events associated with the Clifford coordinates.

The proof is elementary. Let  where ,
i.e.  is positive
definite. The dual cone  consists of all positive
definite matrices  (Recall
that a dual cone  of , where  is some
vector space, consists of such elements 
 that the scalar product   
. As is easy to see, 
 for any  positive definite matrices  and ,
and, if one of the matrices, say , is not positive definite,
then there exists such a positive definite martrix  
that .) . The
two spaces
are identified once the matrix  is used to raise and
lower indices.
 Positive definite matrices  of the form ()
also form a selfdual  cone, which is the usual
future cone ,  in the Minkowski space-time.
It follows that  for any positive
definite . The property () implies
that  for any .
Since the Minkowski cone is selfdual in Minkowski space-time,
  belongs to the Minkowski cone and therefore
is positive definite.



These properties indicate that the Clifford algebra realization of
space coordinates has deep relationship with
the concept of locality and microcausality.
In other words, the generalized space-time  is visualized
via  Clifford algebras. Let us stress that there is no metric
tensor in the dynamical equations () and (), i.e.,
the original  invariant setup
is insensitive not only to the choice of the conformal factor
of the metric but does not contain the metric tensor at all.
The space metric
, which automatically turns out to be
positive definite as a consequence of (),
appears in the theory  upon identification of an
appropriate Clifford algebra  at the stage of
defining  the concept of  local event. It is indeed physically
meaningful to define a physical length measure
(metric) simultaneously  with the  definition of a physical point.
Thus the formulation of HS dynamics in the generalized space-time
drives us to a point at which a
role of the metric tensor has to be reconsidered as not beeing given
ad hoc  but resulting from the analysis of the concept of
locality
in a theory that has no metric tensor in its original formulation.
Let us stress that this in no way means that the the property of
independence of a coordinate choice (i.e., equivalence principle)
is lost. It is guaranteed by the unfolded form of the dynamical
equations () formulated in terms of differential forms.
The new message is that prior defining how to measure
a distance between events one has to specify what is a local physical
event.


 For the lowest values of , the local Cauchy bundle 
 has the structure  with the base manifold
(local Cauchy surface)
 as the physical space and
fiber compact manifolds ,
respectively. This corresponds to
 ,  and  Minkowski space-times,
while the fibers  and  give rise to some spin degrees
of freedom. In particular, for the case of , modes of
  give rise to the infinite tower of spins
in  Minkowski space-time .
Once some local Cauchy bundle  is chosen
to visualize  , the interpretation of different
subalgebras of the  symmetry of the original
equations becomes different.
A  transformation which maps the Minkowski space-time
  to itself leaving the fibers intact
is some usual (Minkowski)
conformal transformation (conformal symmetry is a
subalgebra of  as a consequence of
the Clifford realization of  space ).
Another type of symmetry
does not shift points of the Minkowski space-time acting only
on the coordinates of the fiber. For the case of  this is
the  electro-magnetic duality transformation acting
on all spins, which thus acquires a purely geometric interpretation
in the generalized space-time framework. The
 transformations which shift   in
 look as nongeometric symmetries from the Minkowski
space-time perspective,  extending
 to  which
 mixes fields of different spins.


Conclusions 
The fundamental fact that infinite-dimensional HS symmetry algebras
are oscillator star-product algebras has a consequence that they
contain  as finite-dimensional subalgebras when there are 
pairs of oscillators.  For lower dimensions these are isomorphic to
the usual conformal or AdS space-time symmetry algebras.  For higher
dimensions, starting from the  conformal algebra (equivalently
 algebra), space-time symmetry algebras become proper
subalgebras of the symplectic subalgebras of the HS algebras. In
particular, the  conformal algebra  is a subalgebra of
the  that acts on the infinite towers of massless fields. The
idea that HS theories have to admit a description in a larger
manifestly  invariant space-time is as natural as the idea to
describe supersymmetric theories in superspace. The relevant 
invariant space-time  turns out to be  dimensional
having  symmetric matrices  as local
coordinates (). These coordinates contain usual
space-time coordinates  along with coordinates  analogous to
the central charge coordinates known to appear in the context of brane
dynamics and -theory algebras (see, e.g.,
 and references therein). The infinite
towers of  massless fields of all spins are described by one
scalar  for all bosons and one spinor  for all
fermions which satisfy, respectively, the second-order ()
and first-order () partial differential equations in 
equivalent to all massless equations in the  Minkowski space-time.

Remarkably, these equations do not contain any metric tensor in
. This unusual feature is physically appropriate because the HS
equations in  fix solutions by their values on some
-dimensional manifold called local Cauchy bundle . One can say
that  is the space of physical events.  On the top of that there is
one time evolution parameter associated with a time-like direction
along some positive definite matrix .  For , 
 . Modes on  give rise to the infinite
towers of higher spins.  The electro-magnetic duality symmetry gets
geometric interpretation as a part of the  symmetry which acts
on the fiber .  Metric structure reappears in the theory at the
stage of identification of the space coordinates which describe local
events (i.e.,  for the  case) in a quite remarkable way:
matrix coordinates which admit localization form Clifford algebra.
This introduces simultaneously the metric tensor and spinor structure
in the physical space-time of local events with the indices 
interpreted as (a collection of) spinor indices in the physical
space-time. The lesson is that having a mathematical space like 
is not the same as to have a physical space-time where events
described by one or another equations can happen.  Different equations
in the same space can visualize it differently. Apart from the
simplest (rank 1) dynamical system in  discussed in this talk,
supported by -dimensional local Cauchy surfaces, there exist higher
rank system supported by -dimensional local Cauchy surfaces
.  In striking similarity with the brane picture in
superstring theory physical space-times visualized by different
equations coexist as "branes" imbedded into .

Reconsideration of such fundamental notions of physics as local event
and local distance (metric) suggested by the analysis of the HS gauge
theory may significantly affect the present day understanding of
space-time geometry and related physical theories including general
relativity and quantum mechanics.  The most exciting option is that
this may help to unify these two fundamental physical theories on a
new basis.

The main practical problem for the future is to develop a manifestly
 symmetric nonlinear HS theory. In particular, this will
require to include gauge potentials into the formalism as the
equations discussed so far are formulated in terms of field strengths.
