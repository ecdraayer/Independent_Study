The metric (1) can be trusted as long as the string coupling is not strong. 

The absence of perturbative  superstring (loop) corrections to the local 
UH metric was proved in ref. . It is of considerable interest 
to calculate the UH non -perturbative NLSM metric by including all 
D-instanton corrections. Witten showed that the D-instanton quantum 
corrections are given by powers of ,  where 
 is the type-II superstring coupling constant. An explicit 
non-perturbative solution to the UH metric, with all the D-instanton 
contributions included, was first constructed in ref. . We briefly 
describe this solution below.

Quantum corrections generically break all the continuous 
 symmetries of the UH classical NLSM down to a discrete subgroup 
because of  charge quantization. As was demonstrated by Strominger 
, there is no non-trivial quaternionic deformation of the classical 
metric (1) in the superstring perturbation theory when all  the 
Peccei-Quinn-type symmetries (with three real parameters ), 


remain unbroken. However, some  of the Peccei-Quinn-type symmetries 
(for example, the one associated with constant shifts of the RR scalar ) 
can be broken non-perturbatively (namely, by D-instantons). The 
abelian isometry, associated with constant shifts of the axionic -field, is
preserved when one considers D-instantons only, while five-brane instantons are
suppressed. The abelian rotations of the  field are also preserved 
by D-instantons. Our assumption of the  isometry 
of the non-perturbative UH moduli space metric is consistent with the known 
 symmetry of the Ooguri-Vafa solution describing 
the D-instanton corrections to a matter hypermultiplet. Further support comes
from the type-IIB side, where the N=2 double-tensor  multiplet version of
UH has to be used in the Euclidean path-integral approach to D-instantons 
. The Euclidean N=2 double-tensor multiplet action is bounded
from below, while its  symmetry (after dualization of two 
tensors into scalars) is protected against all quantum corrections.

As regards real four -dimensional
 quaternionic manifolds (relevant to the UH), they all have 
Einstein-Weyl  geometry of negative  scalar curvature, 
  
where  is the Weyl tensor,  is the Ricci tensor of the 
metric , and the constant  is proportional to the gravitational 
coupling constant. 

It is the theorem that any  four-dimensional Einstein-Weyl
metric (of non-vanishing scalar curvature) with two linearly independent 
Killing vectors can be written down in the form 







in some local coordinates  inside an open region of the 
half-space , where  and  are the two Killing 
vectors, the one-forms  and  are given by


while the whole metric (4) is governed by the function 
(= pre-potential )  obeying a linear differential equation,



Equation (4) is thus a consequence of 4d, local N=2 supersymmetry. It is also 
remarkable and highly non-trivial that the linear  equation (6) governs 
the solutions to the highly non-linear Einstein-Weyl system (3), given  
an  symmetry.

The linear equation (6) means that the pre-potential  is a local 
eigenfunction (of the eigenvalue ) of the two-dimensional 
Laplace-Beltrami operator 

on the hyperbolic plane  equipped with the metric 

  
The metric (8) in the hyperbolic plane  is invariant under the action 
of the isometry group  isomorphic to . The linearity 
of eq. (6) allows a superposition of any two solutions to form yet another 
solution. In physical terms, this means that D-instantons have the cluster 
decomposition. 

For example, the pre-potential  of the classical FS metric (1) is given by




The simplest ('basic') solutions to eq. (6) are given by power functions,
 
Substituting eq. (10) into eq. (6) yields a quadratic equation,
, whose only solutions are 

Yet another 'basic' solution to eq. (6) is given by

The  duality is supposed to be the exact symmetry of the 
compactified four-dimensional N=2 superstrings. The action of  
in the hyperbolic plane  is given by


where the complex coordinate 
 
has been introduced. In terms of , the basic solutions take the form



and


where .

The most general -invariant solution to eq. (6) is obtained 
by applying the discrete duality transformations (13) to all basic solutions 
(15) and summing over all these transformations (modulo a stability 
subgroup of each basic solution). 

As regards the power solutions (15a) and (15b), summing them over the
 gives rise to the non-holomorphic modular (automorphic) forms 
called the Eisenstein series, 


with  and , respectively. To be well defined, the sum in 
eq. (16) has to be limited to the quotient  
 with the stabilizer 



In the case of , the Eisenstein series (16) is given by 




where  is the greatest common divisor of  and . The infinite sum
 (18) can be interpreted as the contributions from the D-instantons of
discrete energy  and discrete charge  (see below). The duality-invariant 
sum of the basic solutions (15b) is thus given by the Eisenstein series 
(16) of .

The Eisenstein series (as the functions of ) satisfy the functional equation

where
 
In particular, in the case of , eqs. (19) and (20) imply


Therefore, the duality-invariant sum over the basic solutions (15a) yields
the same  result as that of eq. (15b), namely, the Eisenstein series 
.

As regards the sum of (15c) over the , it also gives rise to 
the same  function proportional to . This can be 
most easily seen by noticing that the  transformations are 
generated by the T-duality transformation,  , and the S-duality 
transformation, . When being applied 
to the basic solution (15a), the S-duality yields the basic solution (15c):




The Eisenstein series  has a Fourier series expansion



Here  is the so-called divisor function

where the sum runs over all positive divisors  of . In the case of
, eq. (23) can be put into the form 



where . The asymptotical expansion of the function
(25) for large  is given by







We conclude that the infinite -invariant D-instanton sum of all
basic solutions (15) is always proportional to the Eisenstein series 
. Hence, the potential  of the UH metric with all the
-instanton contributions included is proportional to 
too. Our quaternionic D-instanton sum in the form of the Eisenstein series is 
a consequence of local N=2 supersymmetry, toric isometry  
and  duality.

The Eisenstein series (25) also appears in the exact non-perturbative 
description of the  couplings in the ten-dimensional type-IIB 
superstrings. When being expanded in the form (26), it
amounts to the infinite sum of the tree level, one-loop, and D-instanton 
contributions, respectively. It is therefore conceivable that the 
non-perturbative UH moduli space metric with the D-instanton contributions is 
completely determined by the exact  couplings in the ten-dimensional 
type-IIB superstrings, similarly to the known case of the one-loop (locally 
trivial) contribution. The exact  couplings in the 
ten-dimensional type-IIB superstrings are dictated by the same  equation 
(3.17).
