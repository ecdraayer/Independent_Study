   Abstract 

Inspired by the intimate relationship between Voiculescu's noncommutative
probability (of type A) and large- matrix models in physics, we look for
physical models related to noncommutative probability theory of type B.  These 
turn out to be fermionic matrix-vector models at the double large- limit.  
They describe different quantum orbifold spacetimes with boundaries.  Their
critical exponents coincide with that of ordinary quantum spacetime, but their
renormalised tree-level one-boundary amplitudes differ.

Introduction 
s1 

The interplay between noncommutative probability and large- matrix models 
is a wonderful example of how mathematics and physics mutually benefit from 
each other.  Noncommutative probability theory (of type A) was originally 
developed by Voiculescu as a tool to analyse some von Neumann algebras 
; this analysis was rendered possible by random matrices.  It can be 
shown that a large class of random matrices is asymptotically free as the 
order of the matrices is taken to infinity.  Hence it constitutes a major 
example of noncommutative probability.

Nonetheless, random matrices show up in physics as well.  An important 
example is Yang-Mills theory.  The "infinite-dimensional" Yang-Mills 
matrix field was dubbed the master field.  The master field 
enjoys greatly simplifying features and is believed to hold the key to a 
deeper understanding of Yang-Mills theory.  Among other examples are quantum 
gravity and string theory.  The large- expansion of matrix models was found 
out to be a genus expansion; the dual of the Feynman diagrams of 
the leading term may be treated as discretised random spherical surfaces of 
quantum spacetime or string worldsheet.  The 
commonality of random matrices in mathematics and physics triggers an interest 
in the relationship between noncommutative probability theory of type A and 
large- matrix models. 
It is now possible to think of notions of noncommutative probability in 
physical terms and describe the master field in algebraic terms.

However, mathematicians have recently realised that other noncommutative 
probability spaces exist.  This is achieved by a reformulation of 
noncommutative probability theory of type A in terms of non-crossing 
partitions of type A, which, in turn, is related to the 
Mo bius inversion theory in the lattices of non-crossing partitions 
.  Then the fact that other types of non-crossing partitions 
exist prompted an attempt to develop a "noncommutative 
probability theory of type B" from non-crossing partitions of type B 
.  Given the intimate relation between noncommutative probability 
theory of type A and large- matrix models, naturally we would like to ask 
if there exist large- matrix models "of type B".

Yes, such matrix models exist; they are fermionic matrix-vector models in the
double large- limit.  Fermionic matrix (vector) models are models 
in which the matrix entries (vector components) are Grassman numbers.  Their 
convergent behavior is, in general, better than their bosonic counterparts.  
Physically, they describe two-dimensional quantum spacetime, random polymers 
, or induced gauge theory.  The basic ingredients 
of the models in this article are -dimensional vectors of 
 matrices of Grassmann numbers; these are thus simultaneously matrices and 
vectors.  We will take  to infinity first and  to infinity 
afterwards.  Then the dual of the Feynman diagrams of these models describes 
quantum orbifold spacetime or strings in an orbifold.

We will deal with the physical aspect of fermionic matrix-vector models in 
this article in detail; the more mathematical aspect will be discussed in 
future works.

Here is a synopsis of this article.  We will review the relationship between
noncommutative probability theory of type A and large- matrix models in 
Section .  Then we will introduce non-crossing partitions of type B 
and a class of fermionic matrix-vector models which generates these partitions 
in Section .  In Section , we will identify these partitions
as random surfaces of a bounded region of the orbifold 
 and compute the full Green functions (moments) at the double 
large- limit.  We will also show by means of the Schwinger-Dyson equation 
that the renormalised tree-level one-boundary amplitude and critical exponent 
associated with the string susceptibility at the continuum limit are identical 
to those of ordinary quantum spacetime.  In Section , we will 
construct a different class of fermionic matrix-vector models which generates 
random surfaces of a bounded region of the quantum orbifold 
.  We will show that its critical exponent is also the same as that 
of ordinary quantum spacetime, but it has a different one-boundary amplitude.  
Finally, we will indicate possible extensions of this work in Section .

Noncommutative Probability  Large- Matrix Models 
s2 

A noncommutative probability space  (of type A) was originally defined
by D. Voiculescu as an ordered pair , where
 is a complex unital C-algebra and  
a linear functional satisfying the normalisation condition that .  
Each element  of  may be considered as a random variable and 
 its expectation value.

A useful notion of noncommutative probability theory is the non-crossing
cumulant.  To define what it is, let us digress for a moment
and introduce a few auxiliary notions first.  Consider a finite set  of
integers.  Let  be a partition of .  We write  if
 and  are numbers of  such that they are in the same block (or
cell) of the partition .  Furthermore,  is a non-crossing partition 
of type A  if  and  imply that 
 for any four integers , , , and  in  such that 
.  An example of a non-crossing partition of type A is 
illustrated in Fig..  The set of all non-crossing partitions of type A 
of  is denoted as .  If , we will 
abbreviate  as  as there will be no danger of 
confusion.


typea.eps

partition of the numbers 1, 2, , 12 into the blocks ,

partition of type A, but the (same) partition of the numbers 1, 2, , 6, -1, 
-2, , -6 into the blocks , , , 
and  is not a non-crossing partition of type B.  This 
may also be regarded as a planar Feynman diagram with each intersection point 
and the lines connected to it inside the great circle representing a connected 
Green function.

A non-crossing cumulant  is a multilinear functional 
, where  is any positive integer, such that
   (a_1 a_2 a_k) = _p NC^(A)  (k) 
   _ is a block of    _card()  
   ( (a_1, a_2, , a_k)  F).
2.1 
In this formula, if  such that 
, then card, the cardinality of , is , and


We may apply Eq.() recursively to obtain the expressions of all
non-crossing cumulants in terms of .  For example,
   _1 (a_1) & = & (a_1), 

   _2 (a_1, a_2) & = & (a_1, a_2) - (a_1) (a_2), 

   _3 (a_1, a_2, a_3) & = & (a_1, a_2, a_3) - (a_1) (a_2, a_3)
   - (a_2) (a_1, a_3) 

   & & - (a_3) (a_1, a_2) + 2 (a_1) (a_2) (a_3),
2.2 
and so on.  The significance of non-crossing cumulants lies in the fact that
they provide a particularly simple criterion to determine whether a family of
unital subalgebras of  is free and that the generating series of
the non-crossing cumulants, called the R-transform, display simplifying
properties.

Random matrix models in the large- limit furnish a nice physical example
of noncommutative probability theory of type A.  In the simplest 
case, the random variables are, intuitively speaking, generated by a Hermitian
random matrix  of infinite order, which is alternatively known as the 
master field.  The partition function  of this random matrix model takes 
the form

where  is the order of the matrix  and will eventually be taken to
infinity,  is a polynomial of , and  is the corresponding 
measure.  The expectation value of the random variable  is
    (n/2) := _N   1 Z_b  dM 1 N 
   M^n (- N V(M)).
2.3 
 is called a full Green function  in physics literature.
The non-crossing cumulant  is nothing but the connected 
Green function

and a non-crossing partition of type A may be represented by a planar Feynman
diagram (Fig.).  Formulae  are the expressions of connected
Green functions in terms of full Green functions familiar to physicists.

A Fermionic Matrix-Vector Model 
s3 

There are other types of non-crossing partitions which are of interest in
mathematics.  For instance, consider the totally ordered set

It is obviously isomorphic to the set

Moroever, define the inversion map  to be a map which maps the integer
 to .  A non-crossing partition of type B  of  is a
non-crossing partition of type A of  such that the partition is
invariant under the inversion map. Not all non-crossing partitions of type A
are of type B as well; this can be seen in Fig..  The set of all
non-crossing partitions of type B of  is denoted as 
.  A cell of a non-crossing partition of type B is called a 
zero-block  if it is invariant under the inversion map; otherwise, it is
called a non-zero-block .  It can be straightforwardly shown that there
is at most one zero-block in every non-crossing partition of type B.  A 
partition with a zero-block is illustrated in Fig..


typeb.eps  
A non-crossing partition of type B.  The partition of the numbers
1, 2, , 6, -1, -2, , -6 into the blocks , 
, , , and  is a non-crossing 
partition of type B.   is a zero-block, and all others are
non-zero-blocks. 
f2 

Associated with non-crossing partitions of type B is a nascent development of
a noncommutative probability theory of type B in which the
non-crossing cumulants are defined in terms of non-crossing partitions of
type B.  Given the intimate relationship between noncommutative probability
theory and matrix models, it is worthwhile to search for matrix models which
are physical realisation of noncommutative probability theory of type B.  It 
turns out that there is such a class of matrix models - the fermionic 
matrix-vector models in the double large- limit.

A fermionic matrix-vector model is built out of an -dimensional vector of 
matrices , , , and , and another -dimensional 
vector of matrices , , , and .  
Each of these matrices is of order .  Every matrix entry is a Grassmann 
number.  The , -th matrix entry of the matrices  and 
 are denoted by  and , 
respectively.  Any two Grassmann numbers anti-commute with each other.

The action of a family of fermionic matrix-vector models takes the form
   S := N_m N_v  _= 1 ^   _  
   _   

   & & + N_m _n=1 ^  c_n 2n 
   __1, _2, , _2n  = 1 ^N_v  (
    __1  __2   __3  __4      __2n-1   __2n   )^2 

   & & + N_m^2 _n=2 ^  g_n 2n 
   __1, _2, , _2n  = 1 ^N_v  (
    __1  __2   __3  __4      __2n-1   __2n   ) ^2,
3.1 
where , , , , and so on and , , , , and so
on are constant complex numbers.  The partition function is given by
   Z_N_m, N_v  := d_1 d _1 d_2 d _2    d_N_v  d _N_v  S,
3.2 
where the Grassmann integrals are defined as usual in the sense of Brezin
.  The full Green functions which are of interest to us take the 
form




where the subscript  meanss that this expectation value is evaluated with
respect to the partition function defined by the action .

The Feynman rules are analogous to those of  gauge theory.
Some examples are depicted in Fig..  Note that a double-end ,
i.e, a pair of ends of a double-line representing a propagator or a double-leg
of a vertex, represents a row index of an  matrix, a column
index of the same matrix and an index of an -dimensional vector.  If the
subscript of a vector index is odd, then the corresponding double-end 
originates from ; otherwise, it originates from .  For 
instance, the indices  and  in the -vertex originates from
, whereas the indices  and  originates from .  As
a result, we may connect two double-ends together by a propagator only if the
subscript of the vector index of one of the double-ends is odd and the
subscript of the vector index of the other double-end is even.  For example,
we may use a propagator to connect the double-end of a  vertex whose
vector index is  to the double-end of a  vertex whose vector index 
is , but we may not use a propagator to connect the same double-end of 
the  vertex with the double-end of the  vertex whose vector index is 
.  Each of the lines connects a row index to a column index; the 
connections have nothing to do with vector indices. A fermionic loop may 
contribute a factor of  or .  The sign is determined by first 
principles; two Feynman diagrams which are topologically equivalent after 
removal of the vector indices may carry opposite signs.

Depicted here are (a) a propagator, (b) a vertex with a coefficient , and
(c) a double-vertex with a coefficient .  Each pair of solid circles
represents a double-end.  Each fermionic loop contributes, up to a sign, a
factor of . 
f3 

The double large- limit  is characterised by the following formulae
for the partition function and the Green functions:
   Z & := & _N_m   _N_v   Z_N_m, N_v ,
   and  

   G(n) & := & _N_m   _N_v   G_N_m, N_v  (n).
3.3 
Note that we take  to infinity before  taking  to infinity;
this ensures that only connected Feynman diagrams will contribute to .
Moreover, only those Feynman diagrams which satisfy the following condition
survive the large- limit:
 
if, in a Feynman diagram, a propagator connects together two double-ends 
whose vector indices are  and , then in the same diagram there 
must be another propagator connecting two other double-ends whose vector 
indices are  and , too. 
Furthermore, only planar Feynman diagrams which survive the large- limit
contribute to the double large- limit.  An example of such a Feynman 
diagram is illustrated in Fig..  This diagram contributes to
Fig., which, as a Feynman diagram, each intersection point and the
lines connected to it inside the great circle represent a connected Green
function, any pair of vector indices  of the sources are abbreviated as 
 and  for any value of , and the vector indices of the vertices are 
suppressed.

Quantum Orbifold Spacetime 
s4 

It is well known that the dual of the Feynman diagrams of matrix models
associated with noncommutative probability theory of type A may be regarded as 
discrete random surfaces of two-dimensional quantum gravity.  (See, e.g,
Refs. and and the references therein.)  Does the 
fermionic matrix-vector model play a role in quantum gravity as well?

A clue may be found in Fig..  Choose the center of the great circle to
be the origin of a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system.  Point the
-axis to the index .  Then the figure respects parity transformation 
 and  about the origin.  So does its dual.  Though a 
thoroughly rigorous proof is lacking, it is probably true that every Feynman 
diagram of  which contributes to the double large- limit exhibits the 
same symmetry.  Hence we assert that the dual of the Feynman diagrams of 
 in the double large- limit may be thought of as quadrangulated 
random surfaces which respect parity transformation about the origin, i.e, 
these are random surfaces of a bounded region of the orbifold 
 .  (c.f. Fig..)  


orb.eps

quadrilaterals paving the surface are in thick lines, and the thin circle 
forms the boundary.  The dual of this surface, drawn in thin lines, is a 
Feynman diagram of the fermionic matrix-vector model defined in Eq.()
in the double large- limit.  Note that the "spokes" protruding from the 
great circle converge to the same point on a spherical surface. 
f5 

Let us study the full Green functions and critical behavior of the simplest 
fermionic matrix-vector model in which only the coefficients  and 
 are non-zero.  From Eq.(), the action is
   S & := & N_m N_v  _= 1 ^   _  _ 
   + N_m c 2  __1, _2 = 1 ^N_v     (  __1  __2  )^2

The full Green functions can be obtained by the Schwinger-Dyson approach.  
Indeed, consider the trivial equation

It is clear from Eq.() that  has a branch cut between

holomorphic structure of the generating function be as simple as possible 
.  Moving along the same 
spirit, we assert that  is holomorphic on the whole complex plane
except the same branch cut.  In particular, the singularities at

the quantum orbifold spacetime.  This is different from the corresponding 
amplitude of ordinary quantum gravity.  The scaling behavior of this fermionic 
matrix-vector model near criticality can be determined as usual by the

We may arrange the fermionic matrix-vectors differently to form different
models.  For instance, consider another family of fermionic matrix-vector
models whose actions take the form
   S' := N_m N_v  _= 1 ^ 
    _  _   

   & & + N_m _n=1 ^  c'_n

The partition function  is given by Eq.() with

The only changes to the Feynman rules are in the vertices.  Some vertices are 
depicted in Fig..

The double large- limit is taken as in Eq.() with ,

illustrated in Fig..  If we choose the center of the great circle to
be the origin of a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system and point the

reflection about the -axis.  This suggests that the dual of the 
Feynman diagrams of  in the double large- limit may be conceived of 
as discrete random surfaces which respect reflection about the -axis, i.e., 
these are random surfaces of a bounded region of the orbifold

Let us concentrate on the simplest model in this family and choose only the 
coefficients  and  to be non-zero.  It follows from

Conclusion and Outlook 
s6 

It is clear from the above calculation that fermionic matrix-vector models
may be used to analyse the behavior of different quantum orbifold spacetimes.
They have the same critical exponent as that of ordinary quantum spacetime,
but the one-boundary amplitudes are already different at the tree level.  It 
is clearly of interest to study the multi-loop amplitudes and double-scaling 
or even triple-scaling limit of these models as well as their multicritical 
generalisations and explore the subsequent ramifications in quantum gravity 
and string theory.  

On the more mathematical side, clarification of the relationship between the 
set of fermionic matrix-vectors of infinite order with the ordered pair of a 
C algebra and a vector space, constituents of a noncommutative probability
theory of type B as defined in Ref., will be desirable.  Fermionic 
matrix-vector models may even be useful in the applications of noncommutative 
probability of type B to algebraic analysis.  (c.f. the application of 
ordinary random matrix models, the embodiment of noncommutative probability of 
type A, to the analysis of von Neumann algebras.)  
Furthermore, just like it is interesting to construct rigorous topological or 
combinatorial arguments to relate the Feynman diagrams of ordinary matrix 
models with quadrangulated random surfaces, it would be 
desirable to develop a rigorous proof for the identification of the dual of 
Feynman diagrams of fermionic matrix-vector models with quadrangulated 
orbifold surfaces and explore the consequences.
