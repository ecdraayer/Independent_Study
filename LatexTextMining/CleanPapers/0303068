Newton potential has been evaluated for the case of dS brane embedded 
in Minkowski, dS and AdS bulks. We point out that
only the AdS bulk
might be consistent with the Newton's law from the brane-world
viewpoint when we respect 
a small cosmological constant
observed at present universe.

Introduction 

It is quite expectable to consider our four dimensional world
as a brane like the one proposed in.
The recent interest is the de Sitter (dS) brane due to the
observation 
of a small but finite cosmological constant in the present universe.
The 4d Newton's law is guaranteed also on dS brane by the confirmation of
the localization of graviton on this brane for wide range of bulk 
configurations, for example AdS and dS as in. 
The non-localized modes, which
are called as Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes, give corrections to the Newton 
potential. They are dependent on the configuration of the bulk space.
For the Randall-Sundrum (RS) brane, massive KK modes yields 
correction like , and it is nicely understood 
from an idea of AdS/CFT correspondence. After that, corrections
to the Newton's law on the brane in the other bulk have been studied
. However some points have not yet been made clear.

It is then of interest and importance to make more analysis about
what kind of corrections appear. 
Our purpose is to see the corrections coming from KK modes to Newton's law
in the case of dS brane for 5d Minkowski, AdS and dS bulks. 
In Section 2, we give our model and the 5d graviton propagator to
study the 4d Newton potential.
In Section 3, the gravitational potentials are examined under a reasonable
setting. Summary is given in the final section.

Graviton propagator 

The five-dimensional gravitational action is obtained, in the
Einstein frame, as(
Definitions taken here are, 
, 
 and diag. 
Five dimensional suffices are denoted by capital Latin and 
four dimensional ones by Greek letters.

    S = 12^2 
      d^5X-G  (R -  2+ L_m )
          +2d^4x-g K
        - d^4x-g  , 
where  and  denotes 
the extrinsic curvature on the boundary. Five and four dimensional metrics
are denoted as  and .
The Lagrangian density  represents a contribution from matter, and 
not needed to construct a background metric. 
The last term shows a brane action. 
The Einstein equation derived from  is solved under an assumption, 
 ds^2= A^2(y)-dt^2+a_0^2(t)_ij (x^i)dx^i dx^j 
           +dy^2   ,
where coordinates parallel and transverse to a brane are 
denoted by  and , respectively. 
The brane is located at . 
We restrict our interest here to the case of a
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker type
(FRW) universe. Then, the three-dimensional metric 
is described in Cartesian coordinates as



where the parameter values  correspond to 
flat, closed, and open universe, respectively.
The scale factors,  and , are obtainable from the Einstein 
equation. 

A perturbed metric , representing graviton, is assumed to have a form 
 ds^2= A^2(y)
  -dt^2+a_0(t)^2[_ij +h_ij (t,x^i,y)]dx^i dx^j 

           +dy^2   , 
where the case  is taken. In this case,
 and  is
the 4d cosmological constant, which is written by other parameters 
as   = ^4^2/36+/6 . 
A traceless and transverse component, , of the perturbation is relevant to 
Newton's law on our brane and its corrections. 
Projecting the component out with conditions  and
, its 5d propagator, , should
satisfy the following equation,
 _5 _5  (x,y;x^ ,y^ ) = ^4 (x - x^ )
(y - y^ ) -G    , 
where 
 _51-G  _N -G  G^NL _L
       = 1A^2(y) _4 + 
        (_y^2+4A (_yA)_y)   
and .


When a new coordinate  and a redefined propagator  
are introduced as 
and , 
 is solved as
 (x,z;x^ ,z^ )=u(0,z) _0(x,x') u(0,z')
+ _m_0^2 ^  d m^2  u(m,z) _m(x,x') u(m,z')
 ,
[-_z^2+V(z)]u(m,z)=m^2 u(m,z)   ,
(_4^2-m^2)_m
= ^4 (x - x^ ) -g   ,
where ,
and  corresponds the mass observed on the brane, 
as seen in Eq. (). The explicit form of the
4d propagator, , on AdS brane is not expressed here since we don't
use it.
The eigenmodes, the solutions of (), 
consist of a zero mode  
and continuum KK modes  
with , for the given bulks, 
where . The normalization of  is given by
demanding 
_z_0 ^ dz u(0,z)^2=1.
This integration is easily performed numerically.
As for the KK mode , its normalization is obtained by imposing the 
following condition
_z_0 ^ dz u(m,z)u(m',z)=(m^2-m'^2).
The explicit form of  can be obtained in terms of the two independent
and complex-conjugate solutions (denoted by  and  below)
of the equation 
(), together with the boundary condition on a brane 
, 
 u'(z_0)=-^24 u(z_0).   The result is summarized as 
u(m,z)=  1  2i   1    
[e^i_0()  F_1(z)-e^-i_0()  F_2(z)]  ,
e^2i_0() = F_2'(z_0) + ^2 4  F_2(z_0)  
           
         F_1'(z_0) + ^2 4  F_1(z_0)    , 

where  and 
F_1(z)=Y^-id   _2F_1(b_1,b_2;b_3;-Y), F_2(z)=Y^id   _2F_1(b_1',b_2';b_3';-Y) for   <0 , 
 


F_1(z)=X^-id   _2F_1(b_1,b_2;b_3;X),  F_2(z)=X^id   _2F_1(b_1',b_2';b_3';X)  for   >0 , 

 Y=1sinh ^2( z) , 
 X=1cosh ^2( z) , 
 d=-9+4m^2/ 4 ,  
   b_1=- 34 -id, b_2=54 -id, b_3=1-2id, 
  b_1'=- 34 +id, b_2'=54 +id, b_3'=1+2id . 
Here  denotes the Gauss's hypergeometric function. 
For ,  represents an outgoing wave asymptotically, 
while  does an incoming wave, and both are complex 
conjugate to each other. 

To see that this solution satisfies the above normalization condition,
it is convenient to use the followings two relations. The first one
is the following asymptotic form at large , 
   u(m,z) 1    (z + _)  ,
where ,  means a phase dependent on .
The second relation is given by using () as, 
u(m,z)u(m',z)=1m^2-m'^2 
     u(m,z)_z^2u(m',z)-u(m',z)_z^2u(m,z).
The present universe implies 
a small , then 
we concentrate our discussion on such a case.
An observational time  of Newton's law  
is much smaller than the cosmic age,  Gyr. 
For the case of such a small time, the scale factor 
 on a brane 
is well approximated by , and the de-Sitter propagator denoted above
by  can be approximated into the one in Minkowski space. 
The approximate form of the 5d propagator, 
valid at , is then obtained as 
 (x,z;x^ ,z^ ) &=&
u(0,z)u(0,z')
d^4p (2)^4  e^ip(x-x')  -p^2 + i   

&& + _m_0^2 ^  d m^2   u(m,z) u(m,z') 
d^4p (2)^4  e^ip(x-x')  -p^2-m^2 + i   . 
In the limit of , Eq. () is correct. 


Corrections to Newton's Law 

The static potential  between two objects of unit mass on a brane is defined as    U(r) &=& U(r)/^2 = - _- ^  dt 
           _5 (t,x_i,y;t',x_i',y')_y=y'=0, t'=0  

         &=& - _- ^  dt 
           (t,x_i,z;t',x_i',z')_z=z'=z_0, t'=0  , 
where . 
Inserting the approximate form () into 
Eq. () leads to  for 
U_0  u(0,z_0)^2 4 r 
, 
 U _m_0^2 ^  d m^2   
 u(m,z_0)^2 e^-mr  4 r   .
The term  guarantees Newton's law, and  represents 
its correction. The correction depends 
on the magnitude of KK mode  on a brane. 


Particularly at , namely on a brane, the KK mode has a simple form 
u(m,z_0)= - 1    
 F_1'(z_0) + ^2 4  F_1(z_0)  , 
where use has been made of 
. Inserting 
Eq. () into Eq. () leads to 
 U = 1 2 ^2  r   _m_0 ^  d m   
  m F   e^-mr    , 
F F_1'(z_0) + ^2 4  F_1(z_0)^2.
Equation () thus obtained is based on 
Eq. () which is valid 
for . So Eq. () is accurate 
for , because the distance  between two massive 
objects 
is related to the propagation time of graviton  as 
. Particularly in the limit , 
Eq. () is correct for any . 


Randall-Sundrum brane  

As for the Randall-Sundrum brane, in which ,   
corrections to Newton's law are well known at , 
where  is the radius defined by . 
In this subsection, the corrections are analyzed for both regions 
of  and . 


For , 
the corresponding solutions  and  of 
the equation () are given as 
 and 
, 
where  for the Bessel functions 
 and  of integer . Since  in the case,
 in Eq. () is expressed as 
, indicating that 
 at the small limit of  and  at the large 
limit. 

Firstly, consider the region  where  is approximated
by the one for small  since  and  are 
mutually conjugate due
to the factor  in the integrand in (). 
Then we obtain

which leads to a well-known result . 


While in the region of small , , the potential can be estimated
by the approximation of , and we obtain
 
It indicates , then 
the pole contribution of  is small and 
5d Newton's law appears as the dominant potential
in the region  as expected. This is pointed out also in.


dS brane with small   

The dS brane, in which , can be embedded in three types of 
bulks, AdS, dS and the 5d Minkowski 
space. In this case, two scale parameters appear in studying 
the potential at some region of . Due to the
relation (), the region of  in the two bulks, dS and 
the 5d Minkowski space, is restricted to a short range region as shown below.


For the 5d Minkowski space as a simple case,  is obtained as 
, leading to . This is understood also from
the above approximate form of  at large . For 5d Minkowski, 
and this implies that the potential in this case expresses the exact 5d limit
at any .


The similar situation is seen also in
the dS bulk. Consider it with the radius . 
As noted above in (),  is related to  as 
. This relation shows  
that  for the dS bulk, that is, . 
Then we can not see the region of  or . Therefore,
 correction can not be seen in this case. And the available region
is restricted to the short range region. As a result, 
it is easy to see 5d potential, , at small  as in the case of RS
given above.

Further, we can see that the potential  coming from the 
trapped zero mode
is not the leading term any more in this region.
The  term  depends on the magnitude  
on the brane. 
The magnitude is estimated by using the explicit form of the solutions given 
above (). By setting as  we obtain, 
 with  
and . 
It is impossible to integrate  over  analytically. 
So an order estimate is made for  with the relation, 

, 
which is valid for any positive . Making an analytic integration 
for each function in the lower and upper bounds of the relation, 
one can obtain the relation 
, 
where  for 
. 
This indicates that  is of order , because 
 in the entire region . 
This order estimation leads to  
for the case of dS bulk. 


The terms  and  calculated above lead to 
 for . 
>From the observation or our assumption , 
this estimation is justified. This indicates 
that the present universe is not embedded in the dS 
or Minkowski bulk when we consider according to our brane model. 




As for AdS, () gives no considerable constraint on  or the
range of . As a matter of fact, the situation is similar to the case 
of the RS brane since  is so small compared to the value of .
However  is slightly
different from the one of RS, especially near . While
the function  has the same form in the large 
limit of , since  tends to  in the limit. 
Figure 1 shows the behavior of  at smaller  for various . 


 
  The solid curve shows , 
and the dotted curves represent
 for  and  where  from
the highest to the lowest one. The end points at small  of the dotted curves
correspond to the values at  for each .
We can see that  approaches to
the RS limit as . 

The value of  can be measured by  in the theory, 
so we take as  in the figure. But
it should be taken at about  actually, then the realistic
case is infinitely near the RS limit. 


Generally, it is possible to approximate  by 
F c_0 + c_1 m + c_2m^2  , 
 
where  are dependent on  and .
When the value of  becomes small, ,  and 
 approaches to the one of RS brane. So it would be possible to find a
similar potential at large  to the one of RS case when the parameters 
 and
 are appropriately chosen. 

However the essential difference
from the RS case would be seen in the ratio , which represents
the ratio of the correction like  and the leading term of .
It would be expected that this ratio shifts from the RS case, 
, and can be written as

To study the meaning of this difference is an interesting
problem from the theoretical viewpoint of AdS/CFT correspondence. 
We will discuss this issue in the future paper.


As a result of this section, we can say that the favorable bulk
configuration of the brane-world would be the AdS










Summary 

In this paper, Newton potential has been evaluated for the case of dS 
brane embedded in Minkowski, dS and AdS bulks.  

For this purpose, an approximate propagator () 
has been derived, which is valid at .  
Then on the basis of the propagator, the static potential  has been  
divided into  which guarantees Newton's law and  which 
represents its correction.  The formula (), which 
is accurate for , was used to evaluate the correction.  

Next it is verified to reproduce the correct RS limit in the case of 
.  
Then the case of 5d Minkowski was examined and it was shown that 
the potential expresses the exact 5d limit at any .  
The similar situation was seen also in the dS bulk.  Namely we can not 
see the region of  so that the available region is restricted to 
the short range region.  Furthermore, we could see the potential 
 is not leading term but the "correction" 
 is the dominant part.  This indicates
that the present universe is not embedded in the Minkowski or dS bulk 
when we consider according to our brane model.  

As for AdS bulk, it would be possible to find the similar potential 
at large  to the one of RS case when the parameters  and
 are appropriately chosen.
However the essential difference lies in the fact that it would be 
expected that the ratio  shifts from the RS case,
, and can be written as
.  
To study the meaning of this difference is an interesting
problem from the theoretical viewpoint of AdS/CFT correspondence.
We will discuss this issue in the future paper.

In conclusion, we can say that the favorable bulk
configuration of the brane-world would be the AdS 
at the present universe.  The formula () valid at 
 is useful in comparing this theory 
with the measured corrections to Newton's law, 
because all the measurements are performed 
in the region .
