Introduction 

The Dirac oscillator was first formulated and investigated in the
context of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics
by Moshinsky-Szczepaniak. They construct
a Dirac Hamiltonian, linear in the momentum  and position 
whose square leads to the ordinary harmonic oscillator in the
nonrelativistic limit.
In 1992, Dixit et al.  instead of modifying the momentum,
considered a
Dirac oscillator with scalar coupling, by modification of the mass term
.

In a recent paper Alhaidari has proposed a generalization for Moshinsky's
equation which contains the
oscillator and the Coulomb
problem as special cases.
He also
claims to have formulated and solved the
Dirac-Morse problem and obtaining its relativistic bound states
and spinor wave functions.
In a later paper a similar method is applied to include shape invariant
potentials via supersymmetry in quantum mechanics (SUSYQM).
However, his calculation  contains serious mistakes as we
explain below.
We also explain another way of treating the problem.


Problem with Alhaidari's Calculation 

The Hamiltonian that appears in the work of Alhaidaridoes not lead to his
equation (1). The Hamiltonian should be
in the notation is that of Bjorken and Drell.


 
where  and we consider
 and the mass as being 
 Due to the matrix  accompanying  in the Hamiltonian Alhaidari's
interpretation of the vector  as an
electromagnetic potential is incorrect.
To verify our assertion we put

 
where  are as defined in reference.
Then using the relations

 
and

 
where  for ,
and defining

 
we get the radial equations
 
where  are the Pauli matrices. The last equation corresponds
to Alhaidari's equation (1) where the quantum numbers  and  are
omitted incorrectly.

 Next, there is no reason for the functions  and 
which appear in the Hamiltonian to depend on the angular quantum numbers
which make their appearance only when we separate variables to solve the
Dirac equation. Hence his choice of the constraint

 
cannot be satisfied since  for 
is not a fixed quantity.
Since the Dirac operator

 
satisfies the property

 
Alhaidari could have avoided the contradiction by taking the Hamiltonian to be

 
which leads to the radial equations

 
Applying the transformation

 
we have

 
Choosing
 
Hence

 
which gives

 
and

 
The last three equations correspond to equations (3-5) of Alhaidari.
The choice  gives equations (4) and (7) of
Alhaidari.

The resulting energy levels will be degenerate in 
in contrast to what happens in the case of relativistic Coulomb and
relativistic harmonic oscillator problems.

The Morse potential: An alternative treatment 


Even if  one interprets the results of Alhaidari as
corresponding only to  the unitary transformation
is puzzling. It does not appear at all if we start with  as in the
treatment of Castanos et al.  earlier . Then equation
() gives  in terms of  and the second order equation for
  is


 

The  choice  
gives the S-wave Morse potential in quantum mechanics
with an additional  term in the potential.
Although the relativistic spectrum is different,
the same non-relativistic limit is obtained.


Conclusion 

In this communication we have pointed out the limitation
of a published treatment of the relativistic Morse potential
problem. We also present an alternative treatment which is similar to
the supersymmetric formulation of the Dirac oscillator as given
by Castnos et al. .
A similar modification holds for relativistic shape invariant
potentials as well.
