We show how to cast an interacting system of M-branes into manifestly
gauge-invariant form using an arrangement of higher-dimensional Dirac surfaces.
Classical M-theory has a cohomologically nontrivial and noncommutative set of gauge
symmetries when written using a "doubled" formalism containing 3-form and 6-form gauge
fields. We show how the arrangement of Dirac surfaces allows an integral subgroup of these
symmetries to be preserved at the quantum level. The proper
context for discussing these large gauge transformations is
relative cohomology, in which the 3-form transformation parameters
become exact when restricted to the five-brane worldvolume. This structure yields the
correct lattice of M-theory brane charges. 
 
Introduction 

The bosonic sector of  supergravity is derived from the action
I^bulk _11  = _X(R-12G_4G_4-16C_3G_4G_4) ,
where  and the relative coefficients are fixed by the requirement of 
local supersymmetry once the fermions have been included. The  spacetime  is
taken here to be without boundary.

The form-field  has the field equation
dG_4+12 G_4G_4 = 0 ;
this is manifestly invariant under the gauge transformation ,
where . This allows "large" gauge transformation if  is
taken to be closed but not exact;  is "small" if
, for  globally defined.

Rewriting the  field equation as , notice that
one can introduce a dual field strength

G_7 = dC_6-12 C_3G_4
and impose the duality condition 
G_7=G_4 ;
then the  field equation becomes a Bianchi identity:
dG_7 = -12 G_4G_4 .
In this way, the  field equation may be replaced by a duality condition for the
"doubled"  system.

This doubled system has a noncommutative ring of large gauge transformations:
C_3 =_3 ,&&C_6 = _6-12_3C_3[__3 ,_= __6 &[0pt]with &
_6=_3[__3 ,__6 ] &=& 
[__6 ,_=0 .This is the cohomology ring for 3-forms and 6-forms on the underlying spacetime.
These cohomologies are taken for the time being to be defined over the real numbers, but
they will soon be restricted to integral cohomologies when we consider the corresponding
Dirac quantization conditions.

In the rest of this article, which is based on, we will investigate the
way in which the algebra () is preserved a)  in the presence of
2-branes and 5-branes, and b)  at the quantum level.

Current couplings to 2-branes and 5-branes 

For an -brane worldvolume  ending on an -brane worldvolume
, one has , so the basic  coupling 
fails to be gauge invariant even for small gauge transformations .
The cure for this problem is provided by a form-field that exists on the 
worldvolume: the self-dual 3-form , which has a potential . Using the latter,
one can take the combination , which is invariant
under small gauge transformations when taken together with a compensating Green-Schwarz
mechanism, , .

Note that a self-dual 3-form field strength is precisely what is needed in order to
complete the bosonic part of the  worldvolume fluctuation-field supermultiplet.
The transverse oscillations of the 5-brane provide 5 worldvolume scalar bosonic degrees
of freedom, while the 16 broken supersymmetries contribute 8 worldvolume fermionic
degrees of freedom (taking into account that the fermionic equations of motion are of
first-order). Thus, in order to have a bose-fermi balance on the  worldvolume, one
needs to have an additional 3 bosonic degrees of freedom. This is what is contributed by
the self-dual 3-form, which contributes precisely  degrees of
freedom.

The gauge-invariant field strength for the  gauge field is accordingly the bulk
 worldvolume combination
h_3 = i^C-db_2
where  is the pullback to the  worldvolume effected by the 
 embedding map.

The action for the ,  system can be written
I_branes =I_kinetic +I^brane _forms +I_WZ +I_counterterms 
in which the various terms are
I_kinetic  &=&
T_3_W_3 d^3-(_ )  +
T_6_W_6 -(G_ij ) 

I^brane _forms  &=& 12_W_6 hh + b_W_6 C +
e_W_6 hC + a_W_3 C +k_W_2 b

I_WZ  &=& f _W_7 CG + q 2_W_8 GG ;the values of the coefficients  shall be determined by requiring gauge
invariance. The selection of possible terms in (-) is
made by taking all the relevant products of operators, integrated over spaces of
appropriate dimensionality. Clearly, the  terms are unusual, and their
inclusion will need to be explained. The final term, , is required
for anomaly cancellation and will involve both worldvolume and bulk contributions.


In order to determine the values of the coefficients in
(-), one has to impose the requirements of gauge
invariance but also take into account the fact that the "magnetically" charged 5-brane
and the string boundary of the 2-brane give rise to violations of the normal Bianchi
identities for the corresponding bulk and worldvolume form-fields.

Relative homology and cohomology, Bianchi identities and gauge invariance 

In order to express the violated Bianchi identities compactly, it is convenient to
use the language of relative cohomology.(For some original
applications of relative cohomology to branes, see
.)  Consider a pair of form-fields of
adjacent rank, . The first element in a pair is taken to be valued in the
bulk spacetime, but the second element is taken to be valued in the subspace with respect
to which the relative cohomology is being defined, in this case the 5-brane
worldvolume . Using the pull-back  from the bulk spacetime to
the worldvolume  as above, one can define the relative exterior derivative (or
coboundary operator) as
d(C_k,C_k-1 ):=(dC_k,i^C_k-dC_k-1 ) .The group of forms closed in this sense, taken for now over the real numbers,
is denoted .

The pair of field strengths , valued respectively in the bulk and in the
worldvolume , is thus given locally in terms of the exterior derivative
(): , so the naive Bianchi identity is
. In the presence of magnetically charged sources, however, this must be
violated on the corresponding source loci:
d(G_4,h_3) = (T_6(W_6),T_26 (W_2))
,where  and  are real coefficients;  is the
gravitational coupling constant, needed on dimensional grounds.  has
been chosen to equal the 5-brane tension, as is necessary in order for the 5-brane to be
a  supersymmetric BPS soliton.

After some analysis, the various conditions for small gauge invariance,
taken together with the form () of the violated Bianchi identities
plus use of the field equations yield the following relationships between the
coefficients in (-):
T_3 &=& -a = 2k

T_6 &=& -2e = 6f

T_26  &=& -k e = T_3 T_6 

b &=& 0 .These relations are fully consistent with the "brane surgery" relations
 expected on the basis of charge conservation for a 
brane intersecting a  brane over a  brane,
T_kq T_q = T_kp T_p ,where  and  represent the tension of the
 brane as seen within the  brane or as seen within the 
brane. The relations (-) fit this rule for
 if one takes .

In addition to the coefficient relations (-), one obtains
also the following homology relations from the gauge invariance requirements:
W_2 = W_3 ,W_6 = W_7 ;
the first of these is of course expected since the string is always located at the
boundary of the 2-brane on the 5-brane; the second establishes  as a "Dirac
surface" for the 5-brane worldsheet .

Homology relations are of course dual to cohomology relations, and so one has an
appropriate boundary relation that is dual to the relative exterior
derivative/coboundary operator defined in (). For cycles
 in
 one has the relative boundary relation
(W_k,W_k-1 );=(W_k-1 -W_k,W_k-1 ) .Thus in relative homology, the statement that a pair has no boundary means
(W_k,W_k-1 )=0 W_k-1 =W_kW_6 ,
W_k-1 =0 .The group of homology chains in this sense, again taken for the time being over the reals,
is denoted . 

Pairs of cycles and pairs of forms can be integrated as follows:
_(W_k,W_k-1 ) (C_k,C_k-1 ) := _W_k C_k - _W_k-1  C_k-1 
.The duality of relative homology and cohomology is then expressed via  Stokes'
Theorem:
_(D_k+1 ,D_k) d(C_k,C_k-1 ) = - _(D_k+1 ,D_k) (C_k,C_k-1 )
.One can also give the following meaning to integrals over linear combinations of spaces:
_W+U C := _W C + _U C ,,
.Relative cohomology language can now be used to describe the sense in which the gauge
transformations () remain "large" in the presence of 2-branes and
5-branes. The transformation parameters  for the form-fields
 are taken to be elements of . Thus,  may remain
cohomologically nontrivial on , but it must reduce to an exact form 
when restricted to the 5-brane worldvolume .

Dirac-Schwinger-Zwanziger quantization relations 

The above real relative homology and cohomology groups become restricted to integral
subgroups when quantum effects are taken into account. The basic requirement is that
adiabatic deformations of a dual pair of electric and magnetic solitons through a closed
deformation path should not produce any change in the quantum generating functional
path-integral. Thus, variations of the action  by amounts ,  are
allowed since the integrand  becomes multiplied in that case just by
. A Wu-Yang style argument then shows that if an
 brane worldvolume  is deformed through a closed path  around an
 brane worldvolume , one must for quantum consistency have at most a
phase change
T_3_W_3^final  C - T_3_W_3^initial  C = T_3__4 G 2 , ,
the class 
T_32 [G_4]
must be integral when integrated over closed
manifolds  that do not intersect the 5-brane worldvolume  itself.

Taking then  and using the violated Bianchi identity 
 yields the - brane Dirac quantization rule for the
cell units of the brane charge/tension lattice:
T_3T_6 2 .In addition, one has a quantization relation for the self-dual (dyonic) string on the
5-brane worldvolume . Firstly, note that the dimension here is in the
sequence , , for which the Dirac-Schwinger-Zwanziger quantization
condition for dyons with (electric,magnetic) charges  is symmetric 
:
e_1g_2 + e_2g_1 = 2 , .Thus, for dyons with , one has the charge relation ,
. This might appear to give a unit cell that is out by a factor of 
with respect to the unit expected, but one needs to recall that the coefficient  of
 in () also contained a factor of  in the
coefficient relations (). Taking this factor into account and performing
an adiabatic closed deformation similar to those above, one obtains
T_3_(W_3,W_2)^final  (C_3,b_2) - T_3_(W_3,W_2)^initial  (C_3,b_2) =
T_3_(_4,_3) (G_4,h_3) 2 , .
Then taking  and using the violated Bianchi
identities (), one finds out that of the two terms, only the 
integral contributes because the  integral of  vanishes since
 only. Thus one obtains

and accordingly there is a second quantization rule for the charge/tension lattice-cell
units:
T_3T_26  2 .Combining this with the relation () for , one
obtains the quadratic cell unit rule
(T_3)^2 2T_6 ,The quantization rules () and () yield the correct
charge lattice for M-theory solitons
.

 Formulation and Dirac Surfaces 

The bulk plus brane-source action discussed so far for M-theory needs to be
completed by gravitational counterterms in order to cancel diffeomorphism anomalies on
the 5-brane worldvolume  that arise from loops of worldvolume chiral fermion modes
. In order to write these, it is convenient to introduce a 
spacetime  such that
X=Y .Using this, the Chern-Simons term in the bulk action can be conveniently written
. 

The main advantage of the 
formulation, however, is in the way it gives to express the Dirac surfaces needed to
maintain manifest gauge invariance. For this purpose, we need to introduce two surfaces
bounded by
:
, which extends into  in such a way that 
i^_Y(V_7) = _X(W_6) ,
and another surface ; for both one has the boundary relation
V_7=W_7 =W_6 .Since  and  share a boundary, one may flip the orientation of  and glue it
onto  in order to make a closed surface :
(W_7-V_7)=W_6-W_6=0 .
Hence, one can find a ball  such that
V_8 = W_7-V_7 .
A similar construction can be made on the 5-brane worldvolume for surfaces bounded by
. Letting , introduce  with 
 such that 
i^_W_7 (U_3) = _W_6 (W_2) .
Since also one has , one can flip the orientation of  and glue it
onto  along  to produce a closed surface  which can
similarly be taken to be the boundary of a ball :
U_4 = U_3-W_3 .
Taken all together, one has the following relative homology relations for the Dirac
surfaces:
(V_8,W_7) &=& (V_7,W_6)(U_4,U_3) &=& (W_3,W_2) .At this point, we can also state the gauge invariance requirement for the integration
domain in the remaining term  in the action
(), with a coefficient to be understood in the sense of Eq.
():
qW_8=-T_6 3V_8 .Taken all together, the gauge-field part of the action is then
 I_gauge  &=& 
       _X 1 2   G_4 * G_4 
     + T_3  G_4 _7(R) 
     - _Y 1 6  G_4 G_4 G_4 
       

& &  - 12 T_6 _(V_8,W_7)  
       (  G_4 G_4 - 2T_3  _8, 
                 h_3 i^G_4 )    
        

& &  + T_6 4   _W_6  h_3h_3
     + T_3   _U_4  G_4 
     - T_3 2  _U_3  h_3  ,where the integration domains satisfy the
relations (,). The terms involving 
and  are parts of the counterterm structure needed to cancel the diffeomorphism
anomalies on the  worldvolume.  generates the anomaly compensator
 by transgression: 
_diff _7 = dA _6 .
 then cancels a part of the anomaly from loops of chiral fermions and of the
self-dual  field in the 5-brane's  
 supersymmetric worldvolume theory.

Dependence on Dirac surfaces 

The presence of terms like  in the action () may give
rise to concern whether the action as presented describes correctly the 2-brane/5-brane
system, or whether extra degrees of freedom have sneaked in via  the dynamics of
surfaces like .

The answer is "no." One has just the required degrees of freedom and nothing more. This
is demonstrated by showing that variations of the Dirac surfaces in the action
() produce effects that vanish modulo
 as a result of appropriate integrality and relative homology conditions.

Independence from variations of  and  under shifts by closed surfaces boils down
to requiring that the classes
12 [13! G_4^3]and T_62 [12! G_4^2]
be integral. From the flux integrality condition () that 
[T_32 G_4] H^4(Y;) ,
one sees that the needed integrality
conditions follow from the charge-lattice unit conditions
(2)^2  = (T_3)^3 and 2T_6 = (T_3)^2 ,
which follow from (,).

Independence from variations of , ,  and  is more complicated because
some of these surfaces are subsurfaces of others that can be varied, and so are carried
along. Thus, varying  and  by closed surfaces  and , one
induces variations
Y'=Y+Z &&V_7'=V_7+Z_8W_7'=W_7+D_8 &&U_3'=U_3+D_4 .
At the same time, one should also consider the variations
V_8' &=& V_8 + T_8U_4' &=& U_4 + T_4 .
The shift in the action () under these Dirac surface variations is
T_62 _D_8-T_8-Z_8 G_4G_4 + 2_T_8 _8 + T_3_T_4-D_4 G_4
+ T_32 _(D_4,D_4) (G_4,h_3) .
Using again the flux integrality condition (), one finds that this
shift is in  provided one has the boundary conditions for the integration domains
(-D_8+T_8+Z_8)=T_8=(T_4-D_4)=0 ,
which follow from the Dirac surface relative homology relations ().
In addition, one needs to require that 
[_8]H^8(Y;) .
This condition is known to be required also by membrane tadpole cancellation requirements
.

Lattice of Large Gauge Transformations 

Finally, we return to the large gauge transformations. Since the various Dirac and DSZ
quantization conditions restrict the M-theory charges to lie on the charge lattice
determined by (,,), the large gauge
transformations are also restricted. From the flux integrality condition
(), it follows that gauge transformations relating the gauge fields
on different hemispheres must also lie on an integral lattice,
[T_32 _3]H^3(Y;) .
Similarly, the flux integrality condition
[T_32 (G_4,h_3)]H^4(Y,W_6;)
requires the gauge transformation integrality condition
[T_32 (_3,_2)]H^3(Y,W_6;)
and for the 6-form transformations one likewise finds the requirement
[T_62 _6]H^6(Y;) .

Remembrance  
The work of Ref.  on which this article is based was significantly aided
by early penetrating discussions with Sonia Stanciu, who is sadly no longer with us. Her
gentleness and her keen intelligence will be much missed.
