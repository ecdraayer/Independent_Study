Abstract  


We consider supersymmetric sigma models on the Kahler target 
spaces, with 
twisted mass. The Kahler spaces are assumed to have holomorphic
Killing vectors.
 Introduction of a superpotential of a special type is known
to be consistent with  superalgebra (Alvarez-Gaume  and Freedman).
We show that the algebra acquires 
central charges  in the anticommutators
 and .
These central charges have no parallels,
and they can exist only in two dimensions.
The central extension of the  superalgebra
we found paves the way to a novel phenomenon -
spontaneous breaking of a part of supersymmetry.
In the general case 1/2 of supersymmetry is spontaneously
broken (the vacuum energy density is positive),
 while the remaining 1/2 is realized linearly. 
In the model at hand the standard fermion number is not defined,
so that   the Witten index as well as the
Cecotti-Fendley-Intriligator-Vafa index are useless.
We show how to construct an index  for 
counting short multiplets in internal algebraic terms
which is well-defined in spite of the absence of the standard fermion number.
Finally, we outline derivation of the quantum anomaly  in
the anticommutator .

Introduction 

Supersymmetric  two-dimensional
sigma models with twisted mass term
possess a variety of central charges and exhibit (see e.g.)
nontrivial phenomena similar to those of the Seiberg-Witten theory in four
dimensions.  It was noted long agothat   further deformation of
this model by a judiciously chosen superpotential is possible.
In this paper we show that such deformation
results in emergence of a  central charge of a novel type.
(A similar algebra was considered previouslyin a quantum-mechanical context.)  As a consequence,
 supersymmetry is spontaneoulsy  broken down to
, in defiance of a well-known theorem forbidding this phenomenon.
Moreover,
Witten's indexturns out to be useless  for counting the
number of the vacuum  states in this case, since it
always vanishes. The Cecotti-Fendley-Intriligator-Vafa (CFIV)
index,



which might be appropriate for counting vacua
(rather than BPS solitons!),
does not work in this model either, since
the standard definition of the fermion number does not work.
We show how   new indices,  and 
(formulated in internal
algebraic terms) replacing that of CFIV, can be introduced
following the line of reasoning of Ref..
The index  counts the number of 1/2 BPS-saturated vacua,
while  counts the number of 1/4 BPS-saturated
kinks.

In the simplest example including twisted mass and superpotential
we find explicit 1/4 BPS kink solutions. Derivation of anomaly
in the  central charges is outlined. 

Sigma model and  twisted mass 

 Two-dimensional sigma models with twisted mass
were first constructed in Ref. . The superspace/superfield
description was developed in Refs. .
In particular, the notion of a twisted  chiral superfield
was introduced in the second of these works(The word "twisted" 
appears for the first time in the given context in Ref. .) .
Our task in this section is to briefly review
introduction  of the twisted mass 
in the sigma model of a general form and
set the notation to be used throughout the paper.

For   Ka hler target space endowed with the metric
 the Lagrangian of the undeformed (i.e. ) model is
L _0 =
G_j i  ^^j  _^i
+i 2  G_j i 
^j     D ^i 
+R_j i kl  
_L^j _L^i_R^k_R^l 
,
where   is the covariant derivative,
 D_^i = _^i +
_^k _kl ^i^l
.
Here 's stand for the
Christoffel symbols,  
is the curvature tensor, while  denotes a two-component spinor,
=( 
),
so that the kinetic term of the fermions can be identically rewritten as
i 2  G_ij 
^j     D ^i 
=
i 2 
G_ij _L^j 
     D _R_L^i
+ _R^j      D _L_R^i
.
The right and left derivatives are defined in Eq. ().

In addition, one can introduce a
 term which has the following general form
L _=i 2  B_ij  ^ 
_^ j _^i ,
where  is a
closed 2-form (i.e. 
and h.c.). For the particular example of the CP(1) model, to be discussed
in some detail below, 
can be chosen proportional to the round metric
.

If the target space of the  sigma model () has isometries,
one can carry out
  a mass deformation of the model, by introducing the
so-called twisted mass,
without breaking .
Suppose  is a
holomorphic vector field, i.e. ,
 and the Lie derivative 
annihilates the metric,
L _V G_j i 
&& L _v G_j i  +
L _v  G_j i  =0;

L _v G_j i 
&& v^k_k G_j i  +
_i v^k G_j k ;

L _v  G_j i 
&& v^k _k G_j i +
_j v^k G_k i 
 .
Then the twisted mass term takes the form
L _m=  (  mm)  
G_ j i     v^j  v^i
- m(  L _vG_j i )
_L^j _R^i +m
 ( L _v  G_j i  )  _R^j _L^i
,
where  is a complex parameter.
Note that Eq. () is invariant under vector rotations of the fermion
fields, .
The corresponding charge can be viewed as a
fermion number. The axial transformation of the fermion fields,
,
, allows one
to  rotate away  the phase of  at a price of redefining the  angle.

The easiest way to derive Eq. () is to choose the coordinate frame
 () in
such a way that 
v^j = iv_0 ^0j  ,v_0=real  const .
Below the coordinates  will be referred to
as special.
With this choice, the Ka hler term
d^4K(_0 +_0 +2m_L_R +
2 m _R_L
)
leads to  preserving sigma model with the twisted mass.

The choice of the coordinates in Eqs. ()
and () is different from the special one.
Here   the coordinates 
are such   that the Ka hler potential  depends on the
product , so that the model is invariant
under phase rotations(In what follows we will limit ourselves to the
Ka hler potentials depending on
 so that U(1) is guaranteed to be isometry of the metric.) 
 e^i , e^-i .
The special coordinates are related to
 through the transformation 




Introduction of  superpotential 

The question is whether one can introduce a superpotential in the
model with the twisted mass without breaking .
It is clear that a generic superpotential destroys isometry of the target space;
in this case combining the twisted mass with a superpotential
breaks  explicitly .
One can find, however, a special superpotentialpreserving the isometry. In the special coordinates it has the form
d W  = w d_0,
( is a complex constant)
which is invariant under shifts of  (cf. Eq. ()).
Then in the coordinates used in   Eqs. ()  and ()
d W  = w d  .
Note that the superpotential  is multivalued -
 this feature is unavoidable. This causes no problems, however, since
 is well-defined, and this is all we need.
It is worth mentioning 
that such multivalued superpotentials appeared previouslyin the context of the Ka hler sigma models in the
mirror descriptions of the 
projective spaces with twisted mass term.

The superpotential enters through    term. This generates the following
additional term in the Lagrangian
L _F = - G^ i j  (
_i W ) ( _j W )
- (D_i _jW )_R^j
_L^i +h.c. .
Assembling Eqs.   (), ()  and ()
we get the full Lagrangian of the deformed model. 

Note that the second term
in Eq. () forbids the vector
transformation of the fermion field.
On the other hand, the fermion mass term in Eq. ()
forbids the axial transformation.
Thus, the
standard fermion number is not  defined in the model including both
twisted mass term and   superpotential.
A U(1) symmetry involving both fermion and boson fields does exist, however;
the Lagrangian  (), ()  and ()
is invariant under
_L,R  && _L,R 
e^i , e^i ;


_L,R  && _L,R  e^-i ,
 e^-i .
The corresponding conserved current is(Equation () 
in the given form is in fact valid only
in the case of one  complex coordinate  
and, correspondingly, one  , so that all 
target space indices , an so on,
might  be omitted.

Superalgebra 

As was mentioned,
the model given by Eqs. (), (), ()
is  supersymmetric, i.e. possesses four conserved supercharges.
The superalgebra emerging after inclusion of the superpotential is
rather peculiar, however: it contains a central charge
of the type which seems to escape theorists' attention previously.
Here we will  discuss it in some detail.

The easiest way to derive the corresponding  superalgebra
at  tree level (we will   discuss possible anomalies in Sect. )
is to consider the model in the flat limit, i.e. .
Moreover, for our 
present purposes we may drop target space indices 
limiting ourselves to one (complex) field.

Then the conserved supercharges are(It is, perhaps, more convenient
to give supercurrents in the following concise form
, 
,
,  
 where .) 
Q_R &=&dx (
_R)_R + i m_L
-iw  _L
,

Q_R &=&dx (
_R)_R - i m_L
+i w  _L
;

Q_L &=&dx (
_L)_L + i  m_R
+iw  _R
,

Q_L &=&dx (_L)_L -
i m_R -i w  _R
,
where
_R =
_0- _1,_L = _0 + _1.
Needless to say that
all supercharges are neutral with respect to .

The following superalgebra ensues:
Q_L , Q_L &=& H+ P,Q_R , Q_R = H-P;


Q_L , Q_R &=&m q_U(1) - im  dx _x h,


Q_R , Q_L&=& m q_U(1)  + i m  dx _x h
;


 Q_R , Q_R&=&2 mwdx, Q_R , Q_R=2 m wdx;


Q_L , Q_L&=& -2  mwdx ,Q_L , Q_L=-2
m w dx ;


Q_L , Q_R&=&-2 i  wdx_x ,Q_L , Q_R=  2 i   wdx_x ,
where  is the energy-momentum operator,



and  is the energy-momentum tensor.
Finally,   the function  in Eqs. (), () is  
h= .
 (The function  is sometimes called
"the hamiltonian of the
isometry." Indeed, if we
formally consider the Kahler target space as a symplectic
manifold, i.e. as a phase space,
with the symplectic form  being the Kahler form,



in our example,
and view  as a "hamiltonian,"
then the isometry transformations
 become a dynamical flow on the phase space,




Warning: the function  has nothing to do with the energy operator  above.)

Equation () is specific for  flat metric. Introduction
of a nontrivial Kahler metric   modifies
the expressions for supercharges, e.g. 
Q_R =dx G[ (
_R)_R + i m_L]
-iw  _L ,
and so on. This entails, in turn, that the hamiltonian
of the isometry
 must be modified appropriately too, 
see e.g. Sect.  where we treat the example of the  model,
a "relative"  of CP(1). 
 Equations () through () are valid in the
general case,
for arbitrary  metric , not only for the flat metric.
Equations () and () get extended by   anomalous terms,
 to be discussed in Sect. .
A novel feature which we would like to stress is the
occurrence of central charges in Eqs. () and  ()
that do not vanish if and only if both  twisted mass and   superpotential
are present. Note that they are proportional to the spatial size of the system.
Therefore, they are relevant to vacua rather than to BPS solitons,
as is the case for all other central charges.


Implications for vacua 

In this section we will discuss implications of the algebra ()
- ().
For the time being we are interested in the structure of the
vacuum states rather than in solitons.
Therefore, we will switch off all topological 
charges in  Eqs. (), () and ().
In addition we will set . Our focus is the novel central charge
induced by combining twisted mass and superpotential,
Eqs. () and ().

For what follows it is convenient to introduce
two phases
e^i_R  = -w/m w/m ,e^ i_L  = w/ m w/ m .
Suppose we are interested in the vacuum states, i.e.
terms with derivatives in the expressions for supercharges can be discarded.
It is not difficult to see that the following two supercharges
Q_3 = e^- i_R/2 Q_R + e^i_R/2  Q_R and Q_4 = e^- i_L/2  Q_L+ e^i_L/2 Q_L
annihilate the vacua, . Moreover,
Q_3^2=Q_4^2= H- Z,
where
 Z = 2 L wm,
and  is the spatial size of the system. 
The supercharges  (as well as  below) 
are defined in such a way that they are
Hermitean.

As was repeatedly mentioned, in the general case
the only constraint on the metric is as follows:
the Kahler potential we deal with must be invariant
under the phase rotation of the fields , see Eq. ().
A generic potential invariant under these rotations  
has the form
K(^i,^j ) = K(^i^j ).
For instance, the Kahler potential
of the CP() model,




does the job. Needless to say that
the metric




is then also invariant. If we have a single field 
(and its complex-conjugated ) 



where we assume     to be positive.
It is obtained from the Kahler potential 
as follows:
 
Then the vacuum value of the field  is
_vac  = f_0 e^i ,
where the parameter  is any positive  root of the equation
f^2 =  w m   1 G(f^2)  .
The phase
 is arbitrary. In other words, we find a continuous compact 
vacuum manifold (see Fig. ). The number of positive 
roots of Eq. () mod 2
is a topological invariant related to the index introduced in Sect. .

  

lstm.eps  
 The vacuum manifold in the simplest model
with twisted mass and superpotential, see ().
The target space is  with the punctured  poles
(the poles are marked by closed circles).  The vacuum manifold consists
of two disconnected  submanifolds. The trajectory running along a meridian
and interpolating between vacua belonging to the
first and second  respectively 
(thick solid line) is a 1/4 BPS
saturated kink. 
 

Equation () is obtained by requiring
 (or ) to annihilate vacuum. 
 The vacuum fields 
are coordinate-independent; therefore, all terms with derivatives
in Eq. () and similar for 
can be dropped. The very same equation ()
is obtained through Bogomolny completion
of the potential term in the Hamiltonian,




 Equations () and ()
assume that .
The ground state energy density   is
 E _vac  = 2mw0.
Normally this would signal spontaneous breaking of all four supercharges.
The well-known theorem reads that in extended supersymmetries one cannot break
spontaneously  a
part of it:
 necessarily implies that all supercharges are broken.
However, in our case the
unconventional  central extension of   superalgebra,
 Eqs. () and (), invalidates this theorem.
Thus, in the sigma model with twisted mass and 
superpotential,  symmetry is spontaneosly  broken down to
 provided
that Eq. () has at least one positive root.
(It can have more than one root, though.)

Now, it is
instructive to consider
two remaining combinations of the supercharges - those orthogonal
to ,
Q_1 = i( e^- i_R/2 Q_R - e^i_R/2 
Q_R) and Q_2 =i(  e^- i_L/2  Q_L - e^i_L/2 Q_L).
They do not  annihilate the vacuum state since
Q_1^2=Q_2^2= H+  Z.
Rather, acting on   vacuum, they produce
Goldstino,
_G   = 1 2 
( 
),
where(Note that  is related to the phase of
 while  to the phase of .)  
_R=_L 2 +-arg (m),_L=_R 2 ++arg (m).
The Goldstino field is a Majorana field which pairs up with
the massless scalar corresponding to the would-be Goldstone 
boson (Global symmetries such as U(1) in
two dimensions cannot be spontaneously broken . Quantum
fluctuations "smear" the vacuum wave function
  over the vacuum manifold. Nevertheless, in the case of
U(1), a massless boson persists in the spectrum. Its coupling to all 
U(1) noninvariant operators vanishes, however. It is derivatively coupled to the
U(1) current.) 
 of U(1)
to form a massless  supermultiplet. (The above massless scalar
is in fact the phase of .)
The second Majorana spinor field, orthogonal
to (),
_m  = i 2 
( 
),
 pairs up with the remaining massive scalar field to form the second 
 supermultiplet, with mass .
If we parametrize  
,
then the quadratic part of the Lagrangian
takes the form
L ^(2)  &=& 1 2  G(f_0^2)(_ 
^-m ^2^2 + 
_m   _m   -
m _m  _m  
.


&+&.
_ ^+ _G

where
m  = m
2+f f  G
_f=f_0 .
Let us parenthetically note that
in the model ()
m  =2m^2-1   ,
where the parameter  is defined in Eq. ().

If Eq. () has no positive roots,
all four supercharges act on the vacuum nontrivially. Then
 supersymmetry is completely spontaneously broken.

Counting vacua and kinks,  or what replaces 
the CFIV index 

As was explained above,
the fermion charge is not defined  in the model at hand.
Of course,
the fermion parity 
remains well-defined (the latter
is in contradistinction to what happens in  models).

The absence of the fermion number precludes us from using the   CFIV
index.(The Witten index always vanishes here.) 
However,
since  superalgebra remains valid
(albeit centrally extended), there should exist
an index replacing the CFIV index. The replacement must
be formulated exclusively in internal algebraic terms,
as was done in Ref. that treated
 two-dimensional models where
neither  nor  was   defined for BPS states.

Here we   suggest indices for counting 1/2
BPS-saturated states (vacua)  and 1/4 BPS-saturated  states
(kinks)
in the problem at hand (centrally
extended ). Our construction 
is a direct generalization of that of Ref..

A brief  reminder of 
the  story 

In the  case we study 
the representations of the superalgebra  
Q_1^2= H+Z ,Q_2^2=H-Z ,
where  is assumed to be  positive.

For non-BPS states, , the representation is obviously two-dimensional. Each supermultiplet is a doublet.
The BPS states correspond to one-dimensional representations
of the algebra 
which can be of two types, , such that
Q_2 v_ =0,Q_1  v_ =2Z   v_ .
The index is the difference between the numbers of the BPS 
states with the positive
and negative eigenvalues of .
Note, that if the fermion parity  is a symmetry
of the theory, then the above  index necessarily
vanishes.
By fermion  parity we mean   an operator such that
(-1)^F  Q_i   (-1)^F = - Q_i,i=1,2.
Indeed, assume we have a state .
Then the state   is in fact ,
Q_1 (-1)^F  v_+  =(-1)^F(-Q_1) v_+ 
= -2Z   (-1)^F  v_+ .
In other words, the existence of  implies that
the states appear in pairs .



For a generic representation (which can
be  reducible)   the proper index can be introduced as follows:
I _1= Tr   Q_1 2Z   (-t  Q_2^2) .
From this expression it is clear that the index 
, being an integer
and a smooth function of the parameters of the system, is constant
on the space of parameters of the system.
For short (one-dimensional) multiplets
the value of  is . For long multiplets
. 

Counting   1/2 BPS states in  SUSY 

The 1/2 BPS-saturated states in  SUSY appear when   superalgebra  takes the form
Q_1^2=Q_2^2=H+Z ,Q_3^2=Q_4^2=H-Z ,
(cf. Eqs. () and ()).
This algebra has four-dimensional irreducible representations
- these are long non-BPS 
representations with  .
If  the irreducible representations are short, 
  two-dimensional supermultiplets of the BPS-saturated states. 




Cecotti et al.  proposed 
 an index,
I_CFIV  =Tr   F (-1)^F e^-t(H-Z) ,
 which is 
integer-valued, saturated by short multiplets,
 and   smoothly depends on parameters of the system -
thus, it is constant on the space of parameters(
In fact, the definition of the CFIV index in the original papers
 is somewhat different from that given in Eq. ().
Cecotti et al.  proved that their index
does not change under continuous variations of  terms. ) .
However, it requires the existence of a conserved
fermion  number    with the appropriate
commutation relations.
In our theory we do not have this luxury.  In the case under consideration we
do have
 the conserved fermion parity
. Therefore, we suggest to   replace 
by a new index  defined as follows:
I _2,1/2  = 1 2  Tr    (-1)^F  i Q_1 Q_2 2Z   e^-t(H-Z) .
The meaning of the above index is easy to assess. 
Again, as in Sect. , there are two types of BPS states, 
(now both  and  are in fact doublets, say, , where ;
we suppress the  index for brevity). The states  
can be defined through the relation(One should proceed with care 
here since there is no mass gap in the theory.
The supercharges  correspond to the
spontaneously broken supersymmetries;
their action creates Goldstinos.
It is necessary to regularize the theory in
the infrared, say, by putting it in a large spatial box.) 
  i Q_1 Q_2   v_  =  2Z  (-1)^F  v_ . 
Then, the index () obviously 
counts the difference between the
number of the BPS doublets  and that of
  's. Long multiplets necessarily consist of
pairs
; hence for long multiplets  vanishes.

Counting   1/4 BPS states in  SUSY 

1/4 BPS saturated states in the model under
consideration are kinks, to be discussed in  Sect.
. 
There are four distinct central charges in the corresponding
superalgebra presented in Eqs. () through ().
In the 1/4 BPS kink sector we loose   .
If the theory is regularized in the infrared, see the previous
footnote, one can say that short 1/4 BPS-saturated multiplets are doublets,
while long multiplets are quadruplets.
This follows from the algebra () through (),
with  on the BPS states, and all four supercharges 
operative for non-BPS states.

From the algebraic standpoint the fact that the short kink 
multiplets
are two-dimensional is perfectly obvious. 
However, it is instructive to ask a physical question:
"what is the multiplicity of  the kink particles?" The point is that,
as has been just mentioned in Sect. ,
 double degeneracy is the intrinsic  property
of the 1/2 BPS-saturated vacua. It is this double degeneracy
that  is
inherited by the 1/4 BPS  kink multiplets.
If we consider kinks interpolating between specific given vacua,
then they are unique. Therefore, kinks considered as particles, 
form one-dimensional representations of superalgebra,
see Sect. .

Returning to superalgebra
() through (), one can define two types of the BPS states
as follows:
i Q_1 Q_2 Q_3  v_=(Z_4+Z_1)(Z_4+Z_2)(Z_4-Z_3) v_.
Then 
I _2,1/4  = 1 2  Tr    
  i Q_1 Q_2 Q_3 (Z_4+Z_1)(Z_4+Z_2)(Z_4-Z_3)     e^-tQ_4^2 
is the desirable index counting the difference between the
numbers of  and . 

Note, that the index , just like
its  counterpart (see Eq. ()),   
can be nonvanishing only if the fermion parity is broken.
Indeed, if the 
 fermion parity is defined,



then  
 and   appear in pairs ,




Showcase example of 
 model (descendant of CP(1)) 




Here we briefly illustrate our construction
starting from 
 the simplest and the most popular  sigma model, CP(1).
We deform this model by adding twisted mass and superpotential,
following the strategy outlined in Sect. . 
The CP(1) model is the sigma model on the two-dimensional sphere.
It is described by one complex field  and one
complex two-component spinor . The corresponding
Lagrangian is obtained from Eq. ()
by dropping the indices  and . The target space of the deformed
model has the topology of cylinder; the model is referred to as 
the  model.

The Lagrangian  including twisted mass and   superpotential
can be written as
L _  C^* &=& G 
_^-m^2  
.


&+&i 2 (_L _R _L + 
_R _L _R
)-1-   (m_L_R +m _R_L
)

&+&
i  2 1 ^2 
^  __,
where the metric 
G&& 2 g^2 G  = 2 g^2 1 (1+)^2 , 


G  &=&1 ^2 ,1+.
The target space is .
Note that
the only nonvanishing Christoffel symbols
are
= - 2   ,=
- 2    ,
while the Ricci tensor in the case at hand is related to the metric as follows
R = 2G = 2 ^2 .
The scalar curvature  is the inverse radius
squared of
the target space sphere,



The vector fields on the CP(1) target
space are
v=, v= - .
Thanks to the existence of this
isometry one can introduce twisted mass
which
  breaks O(3) of the undeformed model down to  U(1).
Besides twisted mass we add a superpotential
  term preserving U(1) and
 supersymmetry; it
is given in the last but one line of Eq. ().
The last line is the  term.
The conserved
supercurrent has the form
J^=
( _)^^-i m ^  + i w  
^^.
Finally, we have to specify the "hamiltonian"
 in Eqs. () and (),
h= 2 g^2    1+ .
Alternatively the "hamiltonian" can be rewritten as
.
The vacuum manifold consists of two disconnected 's (Fig. ),
_vac  = (^2-1 ) e^i 
where we introduce a parameter ,
=m w 
 1 2g^2  ,
and it is assumed that . Otherwise
 SUSY is completely broken. Elementary excitations
are: (i) a massleess  supermultiplet,
one Goldstone boson plus one Goldstino;
(ii)
a massive  supermultiplet, with mass
m  =2m^2-1   .
The fact that there are two solutions for  at 
 and no solutions at 
means that the index 
in the model at hand. The situation when the classical BPS vacua
exist while  the   index is vanishing is always a special case.
At the quantum level BPS vacua may or may not exist.
Let us show that they do exist in the field theory
under consideration. Of crucial importance is the fact that
this theory is weakly coupled.

Indeed, assume that the classical vacua at 
are lifted.
Then all four supercharges act nontrivially on the
vacuum state, and all four supersymmetries are
spontaneously broken. We should have then 
two Majorana Goldstino fields rather than one.
The fermion mass matrix in the classical vacua splits in two blocks -
one with the vanishing eigenvalue and another with the eigenvalue
.
If  is not close to unity, quantum corrections at weak coupling
cannot move  to zero. 
There is no candidate field for the second Goldstino field.
Hence, the assumption above is wrong, and the vacua
  at 
are not lifted.

As  tends to unity, two vacuum manifolds (circles)
 in Fig. coalesce. At  an extra massless fermion field develops
which becomes the second Goldstino field.
At  all supersymmetry is spontanesouly broken.

Another interesting limit is .
In this limit we switch the superpotential off, and 
the vacuum manifolds degenerate into two points,
the north and the south poles.

We will consider kinks in the  model momentarily.
For generic values of  from the interval
 these kinks have a single bosonic modulus, 
the kink center, and are 1/4 BPS-saturated. 
In the limit   the superpotential drops out,
the angle  (see Eq. ()) becomes a modulus,
and we recover 1/2 BPS-saturated kinks of the model treated in Ref.
.

Kinks 

Let us assume that Eq. ()
has more than one solution.
An example with two solutions has been just 
 considered in Sect. .
Then the vacuum manifold consists of several disconnected submanifolds 
(Fig. ).
In this case one can (and should) include in the analysis
field configurations interpolating between a given vacuum from the first 
submanifold and its counterpart from the
second submanifold. Such interpolating trajectories are kinks.

From the purely algebraic standpoint,
 superalgebra in two dimensions
admits a combination of  central charges corresponding to
1/4 BPS-saturated solitons(This fact was emphasized by A. Vainshtein
prior to the development of the model with twisted mass and superpotential
reported in  the present paper. We are grateful to him for
thorough discussions of 
(super)algebraic aspects. Recently  we have considered
the issue of BPS-saturated solitons in  models in  two dimensions
in a related context in Ref. . Versions of some  equations presented 
here
first appeared in this work. ) .
To the best of our knowledge, none of two-dimensional models discussed in the 
literature exhibits such solitons, however. In fact, 
sigma models with twisted mass and  superpotential,
which we investigate here, seem to be the first example
where 1/4 BPS-saturated kinks with mass
M_kink  =
m  h -w^_vac 2  __vac 1  
appear in a natural way. The definitions of  and 
in the  model are given in Sect. . In this particular
model the right-hand side of Eq. ()
reduces to
M_kink  =2m g^2 
(^2-1   -1 2^2 
+ ^2-1  - ^2-1  
).
The point   is singular, in full accordance with the
discussion in Sect. .

The 1/4 BPS-saturated kinks exist
in generic models with twisted mass, 
superpotential, and more than one solution 
of Eq. (). To study them in more detail
we turn to the model (). 
In this model, for static field configurations, we can
represent the energy functional in the form
H  &= &
G
(-_x+m- G^-1 w  
)

(-_x+m- G^-1 w  
)


&+&_- ^  dx 

2mw -w_x()
+m  _x h
.
The expression in the first line vanishes
provided that
_x = m- G^-1 w  .
If Eq. () has a solution with
the boundary conditions
_vac 1 at  x-,
and 
_vac 2 at  x,
then the Bogomolny bound will be achieved, and the solution at hand
will be a 1/4 BPS-saturated kink.
We will first give the solution and then
present a supercharge which
is conserved on this solution.

The solution of Eq. ()
is 
(x) =e^i 
_vac 1 ^2+_vac 2 ^2 
e^m x  1+e^m x   
where  is an arbitrary phase
marking the initial and final vacua, and
 is defined in Eq. ().  (Warning:   is no
modulus, since the corresponding zero mode is non-normalizable, see Fig. ).
For each given "initial" vacuum from the first submanifold
we have one bosonic kink; the "final" vacuum is fixed.

It is instructive to have a closer look at superalgebra relevant
to the kink problem. Not to overburden the paper with 
combersome formulae we will not consider arbitrary phases
of the central charges, although this is certainly doable.
Instead, we will specify the values of parameters
in such a way that all central charges in Eqs. ()
through () are real and positive. 
To this end we set  real () and replace
mi m,m -im,w-i w,wi w
with real and positive  and  after the substitution.
Then
Q_1^2 = H+Z_1,Z_1 =2mw L- mh -w,
Q_2^2 = H+Z_2,Z_2 =2mw L+mh +w,
Q_3^2 = H-Z_3,Z_3 =2mw L- mh + w,
Q_4^2 = H-Z_4,Z_4 =2mw L+mh - w,
where the  is the spatial size of system,
while the supercharges  are
the following linear combinations of the original ones:
Q_1 = 1 2   (Q_R-Q_L+Q_R-Q_L
),
Q_2 = 1 2   (Q_R+Q_L+Q_R+Q_L
),
Q_3 = 1 2 i  (Q_R+Q_L-Q_R-Q_L
),
Q_4 = 1 2 i  (Q_R-Q_L-Q_R+Q_L
),
They are Hermitean. The momentum  is set to zero (rest frame).
All anticommutators of the type
 with  vanish. The kink is annihilated by ,
i.e. .
Then
Q_1^2=4mwL-2w,Q_2^2 = 4mwL+2 mh,Q_3^2 = 2 mh- 2w.
The first two supercharges scale as  with .
They correspond to those supersymmetries that
are spontaneously broken in the vacuum. Their action on the kink creates Goldstinos,
rather than normalizable fermion zero mode.
The action of  on the bosonic kink solution yields
a normalizable zero mode. 

Note that only one normalizable
 fermion zero mode is associated with the 
kink solution. Therefore, in the kink sector the fermion parity is 
lost, as is explained in detail in Ref..
The kink supermultiplet is one -dimensional,
see also remarks in Sect. .

Changing  corresponds to   motion along the vacuum manifold,
(i.e. in the direction in the functional space "perpendicular"
to the kink trajectory), i.e.
to excitation of the Goldstone quanta. It would be interesting to explore
kink interactions with these Goldstone quanta.
Furthermore,
our treatment of the 1/4 BPS-saturated kink was quasiclassical. What's to 
be done in the
future is to find out
what aspects will survive inclusion of nonperturbative effects along the 
lines of Ref..

Loop corrections 

The central charges in Eqs. () and ()
are 
holomorphic; they 
are not renormalized in loops, and so is the vacuum energy density
(). This follows from the fact that the
vacuum energy density is protected from loop corrections 
in the effective  low-energy theory by
 supersymmetry which remains realized linearly.
This is in full accord with nonrenormalization
of the twisted mass parameter  and the superpotential parameter .

At the same time the central charges in Eqs. () and
() are renormalized in loops. Unlike the
 case, 
holomorphy is ruined from
the very beginning by the condition 
(), and 
  loop corrections go beyond
the one-loop order. Besides, these central charges 
acquire a quantum anomaly,  
which we will discuss momentarily. 

  Anomaly 

It is a
folklore statement that  sigma models in two dimensions present
a close parallel to  Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions
(for a pedagogical discussion of this issue see e.g. Ref.).
The anomaly aspect is no exception. Superalgebra in
  Yang-Mills theory   possesses a (tensorial)
central charge which emerges due to anomaly
generalizing the supermultiplet of geometric anomalies
in  ,  and .
(Here  is
supersymmetric gluodynamics axial current while  is supersurrent.)
A similar anomalous central charge occurs in
   sigma models
in two dimensions in the anticommutators 
and .
We will present here the corresponding result for the undeformed model
(i.e. in the
limit , ). In this limit, at the classical level these two
anticommutators vanish. Taking account of the anomaly induces
(anomalous) central charges.

To obtain these central charges one can exploit a
variety of  methods similar to those exploited  in Ref.
. Deferring a more detailed discussion
till a later publication,
we sketch here a derivation in broad touches.
Our derivation will be applicable to
compact homogenious symmetric
Ka hler target spaces for which the Ka hler metric 
is characterized by a single coupling constant   which is usually
introduced as
G_j i  2 g^2  G _j i  .
There are four popular  classes of compact homogenious symmetric
Ka hler target spaces;
 they are listed in Table 1.  The first class
is usually referred to as Grassmannian sigma models, of which
CP() is a particular case.  CP() models are obtained by setting .
If  we get the showcase CP(1) model.
An important feature crucial for our derivation of the anomaly is as follows: 
 for any symmetric Kahler space
the Ricci tensor  is proportional to the metric, namely,
R_ij  = b  G _j i ,
where
   stands for the coefficient
in  the   corresponding  Gell-Mann-Low function, see Table 1.

 
 
 
Coefficients  in the
Gell-Mann-Low function for four classes of
 compact homogenious symmetric
Ka hler sigma models. 

Now we are ready 
to outline derivation of the anomaly.
 The  conserved supercurrent of the model at hand 
has the form
J^= G_j i  (_^ j 
)^^ ^i +...
Naively   vanishes,
which coresponds to the (super)conformal invariance
at the classical level. As well-known, the (super)conformal invariance
is anomalous - it is broken at the quantum level.
The simplest way to see this is to calculate 
 in  dimensions, rather than in two
dimensions. Then
_J^=   G_j i  (_^ j 
)^ ^i.
Although formally the right-hand side vanishes at ,
this overall factor  is cancelled by 
residing in the coupling constant,



Taking into account Eqs. () and ()
we thus obtain
the anomaly in ,  
_J^= R_ij  2 
(_^ j  )^^i
.
[Let us parenthetically note that by the same token
one can readily obtain
 the anomaly in the trace of the energy-momentum tensor,
^_= R_ij  2 (
 ^^j  _^i
+i 2  
^j      ^i 
+...),
where the ellipses denote terms of higher order in
.]

The next step is to show that the anomaly ()
implies the emergence of the anomalous central charges.
Indeed, the general representation for the anticommutator
 compatible with
superalgebra and the supercurrent conservation is as follows:
Q _, J_,  &=&
(^)_ _ 
+(   )_  V_

&+&_ ^[ A _   R_ij ^j ^5 ^i 
+ B (^5)_  R_ij ^j  ^i 
],
where  is a conserved vector current,
 and  are vectorial indices while  and 
are spinor indices,  and  are dimensioneless numbers.
Equation () also uses dimensional arguments,
the target space covariance and the fact that
the central charges (the second line in Eq. ())
do not appear at the classical level. This leaves us with two dimensionelss constants,
 and , to be determined. Now, we convolute both sides with
 to get
&&Q _,  R_ij  2 
(_^ j  ) (^^i 
)_ =
_ _ ^ 
+(^5)_  _A^

&&+_ ^[ A (^)_   R_ij ^j ^5 ^i 
+ B (^^5)_  R_ij ^j  ^i 
] ,
where  is an axial current.
We perform the supertransformation on the left-hand side.
Then, to  untangle the   
structure we multiply by  
and to  untangle the   
structure by . 
After simple algebra 
we get
Q_R ,  Q_L  &=&
1 2    dx _x ( R_ij 
_R^j  _L^i) ,


Q_L ,  Q_R 
&=& 1 2   dx _x ( R_ij 
_L^j  _R^i) .
Although these expressions are obtained
in the round metric, we conjecture that in this form they
are valid for other Kahler sigma models too.

 As well-known,
the models at hand possess a discrete set of supersymmetric vacua
labeled by the order parameters

 and 
. Thus,
the   central charges ()
determine BPS soliton masses. We plan to discuss
the issue in more detail elsewhere.



Conclusions 

We have considered a new class of two-dimensional 
sigma models, with twisted mass and   a
superpotential. The requirement of  supersymmetry uniquely
fixes the form of the superpotential.
The emerging theory is rather peculiar - its superalgebra
contains
central  charges in the anticommutators
 and 
which are proportional to the spatial size of the system
and 
 have no parallels in the previous investigations
of supersymmetric field theories.
Due to the occurence of these central charges
the vacuum energy density does not vanish,
and yet 1/2 of supersymmetry is realized linearly.
The vacua can be viewed as 1/2 BPS saturated states.
This result defies a well-known theorem
prohibiting spontaneous breaking of a part of extended supersymmetry.

In the model we deal with the standard fermion number is not defined,
so that   the Witten index as well as the
Cecotti-Fendley-Intriligator-Vafa index  
are not applicable. 
We suggest an alternative definition of an index  (in internal algebraic terms)
that counts short multiplets. Our definition
works 
 in spite of the absence of the standard fermion number.

In the last section, we outlined a derivation of   quantum anomaly in
the anticommutator  (in the undeformed theory,
with no superpotential and twisted mass).
An anomalous central charge emerging in this
anticommutator is proportional to

.
The expression in  is the order parameter
known to take different (known) values
in distinct vacua. Therefore, the critical soliton masses
are related to this order parameter.
On the other hand, these masses can be calculated
by using other methods. It seems very interesting to compare
these dual calculations. This will be a subject of a separate
investigation.
