The properties of a non-canonical 3D Wigner quantum
oscillator, whose position and momentum operators generate
the Lie superalgebra , are further investigated.
Within each
state space , , the energy , ,
takes no more than 4 different values. If the oscillator is in a
stationary state  then measurements of the
non-commuting Cartesian coordinates of the particle are such
that their allowed values are consistent with it being found
at a finite number of sites, called "nests". These lie on a
sphere centered on the origin of fixed, finite radius .
The nests themselves are at the vertices of a rectangular
parallelepiped.
In the typical cases () the number of nests is 8
for  and , and varies from 8 to 24, depending on the state,
for  and .
The number of nests is less in the atypical cases (),
but it is never less than two. In certain states in 
(resp. in ) the oscillator is "polarized" so that all
the nests lie on
a plane (resp. on a line). The particle cannot be
localized in any one of the available nests alone since the
coordinates do not commute. The probabilities of measuring
particular values of the coordinates are discussed.
The mean trajectories and the standard deviations of the coordinates
and momenta are computed, and conclusions are drawn about
uncertainty relations.


Introduction 

In the present paper we continue the investigation of new quantum systems
originating from the representation theory of basic classical Lie
superalgebras.
In particular, we study further the properties of a 3-dimensional (3D)
Wigner quantum  oscillator whose
mathematical background involves the Lie superalgebra
 .

The idea itself behind these investigations stems from the 1950's paper
of Wigner
Do the equations of motion determine the quantum mechanical commutation
relations?  .
In this paper Wigner has generalized a result of Ehrenfest .
The latter stated (up to ordering details, which are irrelevant in our case)
that in the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics
Hamilton's (resp. the Heisenberg)
equations are a unique consequence of the canonical commutation relations
(CCRs) and
the Heisenberg (resp. Hamilton's) equations. Wigner has proved a stronger
statement.
He has shown through an example that Hamilton's equations can be identical
to the
Heisenberg equations even if the position and momentum operators do not
satisfy the CCRs.

Wigner's example was a one-dimensional oscillator with a Hamiltonian
, in units such that . 
Abandoning the requirement , Wigner
searched for all operators  and  such that Hamilton's equations 
 and  are identical with the Heisenberg equations
 and . 
In addition to the canonical solution he found infinitely many other solutions,
that is infinitely many solutions for the pair  and .
He interpreted these as position and momentum operators
despite the fact that they do not satisfy the CCRs .

Different aspects of Wigner's idea were studied by several authors. Among the earlier
references we mention -, but the subject still remains of
interest -.

The key motivation for a generalization of the concept of a quantum system   comes
from the observation of Wigner   that the Heisenberg equations and 
Hamilton's equations have a more immediate physical significance than the canonical
commutation relations. From this point of view it is logically justified to
postulate as the starting point the Heisenberg equations and Hamilton's equations instead
of the CCRs.

The conjecture that the CCRs have to be modified, including the possibility that the
configuration space coordinates may not mutually commute, originated recently  from
string theory (we refer to  for a survey on the subject) and also from
quantum groups (see  for a review). However, the idea itself was already suggested by
Heisenberg in the late 1930's (as explained in ), and perhaps the first example
of this kind was given by Snyder .

The above observations justify the consideration of what we call a Wigner quantum
system . As in , a Wigner quantum system (WQS) differs from a
canonical quantum system only by the replacement of the postulate on canonical
commutation relations by a new postulate. In particular, consider an -particle
system in three dimensions with Hamiltonian 
      H  =
_  _^2 2m_   + V(  _1,  _2,,  _n),
 

which depends on the  variables  and , with
, to be interpreted as (Cartesian) coordinates and momenta,
respectively. Just as in ordinary quantum mechanics, the following conditions should
hold:
 
[P1 ] The state space
  is a Hilbert space. To every physical
observable  there corresponds a Hermitian (self-adjoint) operator 
acting in .
[P2 ] The observable  can take on only those values which
are eigenvalues of . The expectation value of the observable  in a
state  is given by , where
 denotes the scalar product of .
Together with others, these postulates are common to any quantum system. We repeat only
P1  and P2  here because we will explicitly make use of them. The difference
with canonical quantum mechanics comes from postulating P3 :
 
[P3 ] Hamilton's equations and the Heisenberg equations hold and
are identical (as operator equations) in .
In the canonical case instead of P3  one postulates the validity of the Heisenberg
equations and the CCRs. Then, as mentioned above, Hamilton's equations hold too.

Here, we shall no longer use the CCRs, but rely on P3  instead. The corresponding
system is called a Wigner quantum system. Although  and  no
longer satisfy the CCRs, following Wigner (and the related papers  -,
),
we shall still interpret them as the operators corresponding to 
measurements of the physical position
and momentum of the WQS and refer to them as position and momentum operators.

Let us point out again that the above postulates do not provide a complete description
of Wigner quantum systems nor of Wigner quantum oscillators to be
studied in the present paper. On the ground of these postulates alone one cannot
determine the expressions for the operators of the angular momentum, for instance.

It is perhaps worth mentioning that postulate P3  can be
weakened (so far only in the 1D case) in a manner consistent
with Wigner's ideas so that deformed quantum oscillators  and, more
generally, Daskaloyannis oscillators  can be viewed
as (generalized) Wigner oscillators.

Our approach to Wigner quantum oscillators is essentially based
on two observations. The first one, due to  Kamefuchi and
Ohnuki , is the  proof that  all  solutions found by Wigner are
different representations of just
one pair  of para-Bose (pB) creation and annihilation operators
(CAOs) .
More generally, we recall that the
(representation independent) pB operators, which generalize
Bose statistics, are defined  by the relations :
[B_i^,B_j^,B_k^]=(ik B_j^+(jk B_i^,
  i,j,k=1,2,,N,  ,,(where, by convention, , ,  are written as
 when used as superscripts, and as  when used algebraically
in the factors  and ).
Here and throughout the paper  and 
for any .

The second relevant  observation is that any  pairs of pB
operators  are odd elements, generating
a Lie superalgebra , isomorphic to the orthosymplectic Lie
superalgebra  . The Fock spaces of any  pairs
of parabosons and in particular of bosons are irreducible
 modules. In this terminology the oscillator of Wigner
can be called an  oscillator, its position and momentum
operators are the odd generators of , the Hamiltonian
is a simple polynomial of the position and momentum operators and
the solutions found by Wigner are different irreducible
representations of this Lie superalgebra.

The  Lie superalgebra is a basic classical Lie
superalgebra from class  in the classification of Kac . In
fact () yields one possible definition of : the
associative superalgebra
with unity, subject to the relations () is
the universal enveloping algebra of .

The results of Wigner can be easily extended to any -dimensional
harmonic oscillator, turning it into a Wigner quantum oscillator (WQO).
To this end one has first to express the Hamiltonian via Bose
operators
    [b_i ^-,b_j ^+]=_ij 
     [b_i ^+,b_j ^+]=[b_i ^-,b_j ^-]=0,
       i,j=1,,N,
and their anticommutators and subsequently replace them
with pB operators (). The
corresponding solutions are now associated with
infinite-dimensional irreducible representation of the Lie superalgebra
. Since this superalgebra is of class  we refer to the
statistics of the canonical quantum oscillator
(CQO) (and its pB generalization) as being -superstatistics.

Having observed all this, it was natural to ask whether one can satisfy
the postulates P1-P3  with position and momentum operators which generate
algebras from the other, different from ,
classes of basic Lie superalgebras.
A positive answer to this question was given in  with
operators  which satisfy
certain relations that we will specify in the next section.
These ensure that they generate the Lie superalgebra .
The corresponding solutions are this time associated with a
Wigner quantum system  that takes the form of an -dimensional
non-canonical  Wigner quantum oscillator.
Since the special linear
Lie superalgebra  is of class  we refer to the statistics
of this WQO as being -superstatistics.

In a similar approach Barut and Bracken  have described
the internal dynamics (Zitterbewegung ) of Dirac's electron.
Their creation and annihilation operators
satisfy similar triple relations as in our
case (Eqs. ()),
but instead of
a Lie superalgebra they generate the Lie algebra .

In the present paper we study further the properties of the
3D WQO, related to the  superalgebra and initiated in .
The paper is organized as follows.

In Section 2 we outline the mathematical structure of the
3D non-canonical oscillator. The compatibility
between the Heisenberg equations and the Hamilton's equations
is achieved with operators 
which satisfy triple
relations similar to those for the para-Bose case (),
but this time they generate the Lie superalgebra
. The Fock spaces  of these operators are
defined. The inequivalent representations are
labeled by one positive integer .  For 
all Fock spaces are 8-dimensional, whereas in the case
 (resp. )  (resp. ).
In the terminology of Kac  the 
representations are called
atypical representations. For this reason we refer to the
Fock spaces  and  as to atypical, to the
corresponding oscillator as to atypical etc. We
shall see in the next sections that the properties of the
atypical oscillators are very different from those
with .

In Section 3 we recall the known  physical properties of the  WQOs.
Firstly, the oscillator has finite space dimensions and the Hamiltonian has no more
than 4 different eigenvalues. In the stationary states the distance of the particle to
the origin is quantized so that the particle is constrained to move on  one of  4
possible spheres. Secondly, the geometry of the oscillator is non-commutative. 
The various coordinates do not commute with one another, nor do the various components
of the momentum. Therefore, in particular, the position of the
particle on the corresponding sphere cannot be localized. In this respect the WQO
belongs to the class of models of non-commutative quantum oscillators -and, more generally, to theories with non-commutative geometry .
It is shown, however, that the non-commutativity between our position and
momentum operators is different from the non-commutativity appearing in
the most commonly adopted form of  generalized Heisenberg
commutation relations (see eq. ()).


All results after Section 3 are new. In Section 4 the
probabilistic distribution of the particle is analyzed. The basis
consists of stationary states. The main result is the following:
if the particle is in one of the basis states with , then
measurements of its coordinates are consistent with it only
being found at 8 particular points on
a sphere which form
the vertices of a rectangular parallelepiped (see
Figure 1). Thus as in , the coordinates of the
particle are observables with a quantized spectrum just like
energy, angular momentum, etc. The number of points, called
"nests", can be even less in the atypical cases. In certain
states with  the oscillator  is becoming a flat object with
4 vertices (Figure 2). There are three states in the  case
when the oscillator is even one-dimensional (Figure 3).
In Section 5 the mean trajectories and the standard deviations of the position
and  momenta operators for an arbitrary state are written down.
It is shown (Conclusion 3) that there exists no nontrivial
analogue of the Heisenberg uncertainty relations since one can
always find a state  for which either  or
.

In Section 6 we show that despite the fact
that the  oscillator is very different from the 3D
canonical oscillator, they still have some features in common. In
particular we show that to each  mean trajectory of the
 oscillator there corresponds exactly the same
trajectory of the 3-dimensional canonical oscillator.

Mathematical structure of the 3D WQO 

Let  be the Hamiltonian of a  three-dimensional
harmonic oscillator, that is
H = ^2 2m 
+m^22  ^2.
We proceed to view this oscillator as a Wigner quantum system and
work throughout in the Heisenberg picture in which the operators
are, in general, time dependent. According to postulate P3 
the operators  and  have to be defined in such a way
that Hamilton's equations
     =-m^2 ,     = 1m and the Heisenberg equations
       = i  [H ,],  
       = i  [H ,]
are both valid, and are identical as operator equations. These
equations are compatible only if
   [H ,]=im ^2 , 
   [H ,]=-i m   .
The most general solution of () and ()
is not known. Here
we mention  the canonical Bose solution. Expressed via boson
creation and annihilation operators it reads:
r_k(t)=2m   (b_k^+e^ i t 
+ b_k^- e^-i t  ),
p_k(t)=i m2  
(b_k^+e^ i t 
-  b_k^- e^-i t  ).
In this setting  and  are canonical position and momentum
operators, defined in a Bose Fock space  with  orthonormal
basis states
n_1,n_2,n_3)=(b_1^+)^n_1  (b_2^+)^n_2   (b_3^+)^n_3 
n_1!  n_2!  n_3!   0,n_1,  n_2,  n_3 _+
subject to the known transformation relations:
b_k^+ ,n_k,)=n_k+1 ,n_k+1,),b_k^- ,n_k,)=n_k ,n_k-1,).
As mentioned already in the Introduction, this Bose solution
belongs to the class of -superstatistics.

In the present paper we deal with solutions of () and ()
for which the operators  and ,   generate a Lie
superalgebra from the class , more precisely .
We emphasize again that despite the fact that  and 
do not satisfy the CCRs, i.e. they are  only
"position-like" and "momentum-like"
operators, we interpret them as  operators describing position
and momentum. 
Accordingly we refer to them as position and momentum
operators in the rest of this paper.
To make the connection with  we write the operators
 and
 in terms of new operators:
A_k ^m 2   _k  i  12m   _k , k=1,2,3.
The Hamiltonian  of () and the compatibility
conditions ()  then take the form:
    H  =  2  _i=1 ^3 A_i ^+,A_i ^-,
_i=1 ^3  [ A_i ^+,A_i ^- ,A_k ^] =2A_k ^,
i,k=1,2,3.
As a solution to () we chose operators  that
satisfy the
following triple relations:
 
&& [A_i ^+,A_j ^-,A_k ^+]=
_jk A_i ^+ -_ij A_k ^+, 2.11a 

&& [A_i ^+,A_j ^-,A_k ^-]=
-_ik A_j ^- +_ij A_k ^-, 2.11b 

&& A_i ^+,A_j ^+= A_i ^-,A_j ^-=0. 2.11c 
In our case . Equations ()
are defined however for , where
 and  are any integers
(including  and ).

 
The operators , ,
satisfying (),
are odd elements generating the Lie superalgebra  .

The generators , 
are said to be
creation and annihilation operators
of . They resemble ordinary Fermi operators (see ())
and can be interpreted as quasi-fermions in the context of generalized
statistics .
These CAOs are the analogue of the Jacobson generators for the Lie
algebra   and could also be called Jacobson
generators of .

Coming back to the 3D oscillator, we emphasize again that all
considerations here are in the Heisenberg picture. The position
and momentum operators depend on time. Hence also the CAOs depend
on time. Writing this time dependence explicitly, one has:
& Hamilton's equations  & A _k ^(t)=i A_k ^(t),  

& Heisenberg equations  & A _k ^(t)=i  2  _i=1 ^3 [A_i ^+(t), A_i ^-(t),A_k ^(t)].
The solution of () is evident,
A_k ^(t)=(i t) A_k ^(0)
and therefore if the defining relations () hold
at a certain time , i.e., for ,
then they hold as equal time relations for any other time .
 From ()
it follows also that the equations ()
are identical with equations (). For
further use we write the time dependence of

and  explicitly:
 
&& _k (t)=2m     (A_k ^+
e^-i t  +A_k ^-e^i t ), 2.15a  

&& _k (t)=-im 2  
(A_k ^+ e^-i t - A_k ^-e^i t ), 2.15b 
where .

Next, we wish to introduce the concept of angular momentum and the
related space rotations.
In order to define the angular momentum operator ,
we assume (as in canonical quantum mechanics, for observables having a 
classical analogue) that its components are in the enveloping algebra 
of  and 
and moreover that they are linear with respect the components of these
operators. We also require that ,  and  commute with the 
Hamiltonian, and that they span a basis of the Lie algebra . 
The operators with the required properties are:
      _j  = -1    _k,l=1 ^3
     _jkl  _k , _l ,
      j=1,2,3,
( is the antisymmetric unit tensor of rank 3), which
take the following form in terms of the CAOs ()
      _j  = -i _k,l=1 ^3
     _jkl  A_k ^+, A_l^-,
      j=1,2,3.
It is straightforward to verify that these operators satisfy the 
required commutation relations:

[_j,_k]=i_jkl _l,

[_j, H  ]=0.  
Hence , ,  are the generators of the Lie algebra , 
i.e. they generate the  subalgebra of .
Moreover they are integrals of motion: they do not depend on time.
We shall interpret  as the operator describing the angular momentum
of the WQO, and simply refer to it as the angular momentum.
As in the canonical case, we shall also identify the components of
 as the operators of infinitesimal rotations. Then the relations
[_j,_ k ]=i_jkl _ l , 
[_j,_k ]=i_jkl _ l ,
together with (), show that ,  and  all
transform as vector operators with respect to space rotations.

The state spaces which we consider here are those irreducible
 modules that may be
constructed  by means of the usual
Fock space technique precisely as in the parastatistics case .
To this end we require that the
representation space, , contains
(up to a multiple) a unique cyclic vector  such that
    A_i ^-0    A_i ^-A_j ^+0ij 0,
i,j=1,2,3.
The above relations are enough for the construction of the full
representation space . This space defines an
indecomposable finite-dimensional
representation of the CAOs () and hence of
 for any value of . However, following P1 
and P2 , we wish to impose the
further physical requirements that:
 
[(a)]   is a Hilbert space with respect to the natural
Fock space inner product;
[(b)] the observables, in particular the position and momentum
operators (), are Hermitian operators.
Condition (b) reduces to the requirement that the Hermitian conjugate of
 should be , i.e.
      (A_i ^)^i ^.
The condition (a) is then such that  is restricted to be a
positive integer , in fact any positive integer.

Let .
The state space  of the system is spanned by the following
orthonormal basis (called the -basis):
p;p;_1 ,_2 ,_3 =
(p-q)! p!   
(A_1 ^+)^_1   (A_2 ^+)^_2   (A_3 ^+)^_3    0,
where
 _i 0,1  for all    i=1,2,3
and
0 q _1  + _2  + _3  (p,3).
The transformation of the basis states () under the action of
the CAOs reads as follows:
 
&& A_i ^-p;,_i,=_i (-1)^_1++_i-1  p-q +1 
p;,_i-1,, 2.23a 

&&  A_i ^+p;,_i,=(1-_i )(-1)^_1++_i-1  p-q 
p;,_i+1,. 2.23b 
The factors  and  ensure that
the only non-vanishing cases are those for which

do indeed belong to the set of basis states
defined by ()-().

Note the first big difference between this non-canonical WQO and
the case of a conventional CQO:
 
Contrary to the CQO with an
infinite-dimensional state space,  each state space  of the
WQO is finite-dimensional.
In fact  for , whereas  and 
.

Known properties of 3D WQOs 

Here we recall the physical properties of the
Wigner quantum oscillators  as given in .

The first thing we note is that the representation of
 was chosen such that,
as in the case of a 3D CQO, the
physical observables , ,  and  
are, in the case of the WQO, all
Hermitian operators within every Hilbert space  for each
 (in accordance with postulate P1 ).

Secondly, in the case of the WQO the Hamiltonian  is diagonal
in the basis ()-(),
i.e. the basis vectors  are
stationary states of the system. As in  the 3D CQO the energy
levels are equally spaced  with the same spacing .
Contrary to the CQO each Hilbert space  has no more
than four  equally spaced energy levels, with
spacing . More precisely,
     H p;= E_qp;  with  
     E_q=2 (3p-2q ).
So we can define stationary states  as superpositions of
states  with the same :
 
&& _0 = p;0,0,0, 3.2a  

&& _1 = (1,0,0)p;1,0,0+ (0,1,0)p;0,1,0+
(0,0,1)p;0,0,1, 3.2b  

&& _2 = (1,1,0)p;1,1,0+ (1,0,1)p;1,0,1+
(0,1,1)p;0,1,1, 3.2c  

&& _3 = p;1,1,1, 3.2d 
where  are complex numbers. The
stationary states satisfy . Only the
states with  belong to the space . Note that in
the atypical cases () the lowest energy level is
degenerate: there are three linearly independent states with the
same ground state energy.

Perhaps  the most striking difference between  the WQO and the
CQO is that the geometry of the Wigner oscillators is
non-commutative: the position operators , ,  of
the oscillating particle  do not commute with each other,
[_i,_j]0  for   ij=1,2,3.
Hence for the Wigner oscillators a coordinate representation
(-representation) does not exist . Similarly,
[_i,_j]0  for   ij=1,2,3
and therefore also a momentum representation (-representation)
cannot be defined .

The relations () and () imply that the WQO belongs to the class of
models of non-commutative quantum oscillators - 
and, more generally, to
theories with non-commutative geometry . The literature on this subject is
vast. Moreover the subject is not any longer of purely theoretical interest. Most
recently papers predicting (experimentally) measurable deviations from the
commutativity of the coordinates have been published -. 
Here however, we only deal with a purely theoretical description.

Following the non-commutativity, it is natural to ask about the nature
and value of the commutator 
(or , or ). The answer to this question is
relevant since it is used in the derivation of the uncertainty relations between the
coordinates for instance. 
To answer this, note that the commutators between the operators  and 
do not belong to the Lie superalgebra  
( and  are odd elements of the algebra),
so they cannot be rewritten in a simpler form.
Of course, one can compute the action of these commutators on basis
vectors of the considered  modules . 
We have actually made these computations. However the
resulting formulas are rather complicated. Later, we content ourselves
with just one illustrative example in ().

It is worth pointing out that the commutators ,
 and  are themselves operators that 
do not commute with each other in any one of the state
spaces ,  and therefore cannot be diagonalized simultaneously.
For this reason the non-commutativity between our position and momentum
operators is very different from the non-commutativity of generalized Heisenberg
commutation relations
[_i,_j]=i_ij ,[_i,_j]=i_ij ,[_i,_j]=i_ij   
often adopted in the literature on non-commutative quantum mechanics (see for instance
 -). In the right hand side of () 
and  are numbers (which are often further simplified, e.g.,
, , etc.) and therefore all operators
, ,  are simultaneously diagonal (in
any basis of the state space).

Turning back to the WQO, there are two interesting integrals of motion,
namely  and . Furthermore, they are proportional
to :
  2  H  =  2 m    ^2
= 2 m   ^2 = _i=1 ^3  A_i^+,A_i^-.
And thus:
 
&& ^2p;2m  (3p-2q )p;,
     3.6a 

&& ^2p;m2  (3p-2q )p;,
     3.6b 
for .
Eq. () indicates that if the oscillator is in a stationary
state  with energy 
, then the distance  between the oscillating
particle and the origin of the coordinate system is
_q= 2m  (3p-2_1-2_2-2_3
) 
and this distance is an integral of motion,
it is preserved in time. For further references we formulate the following
observation.

 
Each stationary state  , which is
a superposition of states  with one and the same
, corresponds to a configuration in which  the
particle is somewhere at a distance   from the centre
of the coordinate system. However, the position of the particle on
the sphere of radius  cannot be localized because the
coordinates do not commute with one another.

The maximum distance of the particle from the centre is
_max _0=3p2m 
and this corresponds to the state , which carries
also the maximal energy . Thus
the WQO occupies a finite volume. The oscillating particle is
locked in a sphere with radius (), which is another property
very different from the CQO for which there is no finite upper
bound on the radial distance.

Finally we note that
 ^2 p;=
   .
Therefore each state  carries angular momentum  or . If
,  decomposes as  with respect to
the  subalgebra of ; herein  is a 1-dimensional subspace
with  and  is a 3-dimensional subspace with . For ,
, and for  one has .


On the position and momentum of the oscillating particle 

The results in the previous section are not very precise about the
position of the oscillating particle in one of its stationary
states  or : the only conclusion is that the
particle is localized on a sphere with radius .

We shall 
first investigate the probabilistic distribution of the particle
on the sphere corresponding to the states  or .
In particular we shall show, with respect to measurements of
,  and , that  in the stationary
states  the particle can be found at only 8 points on
the sphere (we call them "nests") with radius ,
see (), and the number of such nests is even less in the
atypical cases  and .

The main tool to obtain these results is based
on the observation that the set of operators
H ,   ^2, ^2, _1^2, _2^2, _3^2,
 _1^2, _2^2, _3^2,
mutually commute and therefore  can be diagonalized
simultaneously. Observe that  and  and more
generally all even elements are independent of the time ,
which is why we do not write  and .

The sequence () contains in fact only 3
independent integral of motions, for instance ,
 ,, since
_k^2 = m^2^2 _k^2, H =m ^2 ^2,
 ^2= m^2^2  ^2,  and  
 ^2=_1^2+_2^2+_3^2.
All these are Hermitian operators in . Hence we can choose a
basis consisting of common eigenvectors to all of them.
In this case, we are lucky in the sense that all these operators
are already diagonal in the -basis.

At this point it is convenient to introduce dimensionless notation
for the energy, the coordinates and the momenta:
 =2 H , r _i(t)=2m  _i(t),p _i(t)=2mo  _i(t), i=1,2,3.
Then ,  and
 = ^2= ^2  =_i=1 ^3A_i^+,A_i^-.
The basis vectors of  with  (typical case) 

For  all state spaces  of the system are -dimensional.
The following holds:
 _k^2 p;= _k^2 p;=
  (p-q+_k) p;,  k=1,2,3.
What are the conclusions, which we can draw from
Eqs. ()? Let us answer this question first for
one particular state, e.g. .
If measurements of the observables corresponding to
, , , 
are performed, then according to
postulate P2  they will give the eigenvalues of these
operators, namely
r ^2=3p-4,  r_1^2=r_2^2=p-1,  r_3^2=p-2.
Moreover since the operators
, , ,  commute
the results () can be measured simultaneously.
The latter means that if several measurements of the coordinates are
performed, then they will discover all of the time that
the particle is accommodated in one of 8 nests with coordinates
r_1=p-1 ,    r_2=p-1 ,    r_3=p-2 ,
of a sphere with radius .

Similarly, the measurements of
the projections of the
momenta will give (due to ()):
p_1=p-1 ,   p_2=p-1 ,   p_3=p-2 .
The generalization of this result to any -state is evident:

 
If the system is in one of the -basis states
 then  measurements of
,  and  imply that  the oscillating particle can be
found  in  no more than 8 nests with coordinates
 r_1=p-q+_1 ,  r_2= p-q+_2 ,  
r_3=p-q+_3 ,
on a sphere with radius . The measured
values of the momenta can take also only 8 different values,
 p_1=p-q+_1 ,  p_2= p-q+_2 ,  
p_3=p-q+_3 .

Conclusion 2 significantly enhances the properties of the WQO
known so far, and collected in Conclusion 1. The particle is not
just anywhere on the sphere. In every -state  the
particle can be spotted in no more than 8 points of the sphere
with radius . This is what we can say so far. What we
cannot say yet is whether some of these nests are not
forbidden for "visits" or what is the probability of finding the
particle in any one of them.

In order to investigate this last question we
shall need the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of all the operators
of the coordinates and of the momenta. Before that a short remark
related to the properties of any WQS will be in order.

Let  be an observable and let   be an
orthonormed basis of eigenvectors of : 
. Assume that the system  is in a state 
 normalized to 1. Postulate P2  tells us that the
expectation value  of the observable 
in the state  is
O _O )= _1^2 O_1++ _n^2 O_n.
It follows that  gives the probability of  measuring
the eigenvalue  of the operator .
This is just the superposition principle  of quantum mechanics. The conclusion
is that this principle holds for any WQS.

Thus in order to examine the probability for the particle to be
in one of the 8 nests, one has to introduce as a first step
an -basis, namely an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of
  for any . The second step is to express the
-basis via the -basis for any , and to apply
the superposition principle.

One has to proceed in a similar way in order to examine the
probability for the particle to have each one of the possible
values of momentum.

Let us define, for any  and any 
satisfying (), the following vectors in :
v_k() = 12  ( p;__k=0 +
(-1)^_1++ _k  e^-it  p;__k=1 ).
Herein,  stands for the -value specified by the
left hand side of () in which  is replaced by  (and similarly
for ). Thus  depends on  only
through the sign factor . A careful
computation shows that these (time-dependent) vectors 
constitute an orthonormal  basis of eigenvectors of  in
:
_k(t)v_k() = (-1)^_k  p-q+_k  v_k().
The physical  interpretation of each eigenvector 
is clear (Postulate P2 ): if (at the time )
the oscillating particle is in a state  then its
-th coordinate is .

The inverse relations of () are also easy to write down:
p;= 12   (-1)^(_1++_k-1 )
_k  e^it _k 
( v_k(__k=0 ) + (-1)^_k  v_k(__k=1 )).
The main observation needed is that in the inverse transformations
() only two different vectors  appear, each with a coefficient
of which the square modulus is 1/2.
In order to understand the importance of this observation,
consider an example, say .
The expansion of this vector in the  eigenvectors
(for ) reads:
 
p;1,1,0&=& e^it 2  (v_1(0,1,0)-v_1(1,1,0))
 4.15a 

& =& -e^it 2  (v_2(1,0,0)-v_2(1,1,0)
) 4.15b 

& =& 12  (v_3(1,1,0)+v_3(1,1,1)).
 4.15c 
We see that the coefficients  of  and
 are equal up to a sign, and moreover their square
modulus is . Therefore the superposition principle asserts
that with equal probability 1/2 the first coordinate  of the
particle is either  or  . In other
words, the probability of finding the particle somewhere in the
four nests above the -plane is 1/2; and the probability to
find the particle somewhere in the four nests below the
-plane is also 1/2. Let us underline that this conclusion
is time independent. The time dependent basis which we have used
in order to derive it was playing only an intermediate role.

By means of the same arguments, using (),
() and (),
one concludes that also with probability  the second
coordinate  and the third coordinate  of the particle
take values  and , respectively
for the state .

Taking the three results (about the probabilities for ,
 and ) together does however not lead to a unique
solution for the probabilities to find the particle in a
particular nest.
Indeed, there are 8 probabilities to be
determined (one for each nest). From () we have deduced that
the sum of four of them (above the -plane) is 1/2, and the
sum of the remaining four (below the -plane) is also 1/2; so
this yields 2 linear relations for the 8 unknown probabilities.
Similarly, () and () each yield 2 linear relations. So
in total there are 6 linear relations in 8 unknowns. A more
detailed investigation even shows that only 4 of the 6 linear
relations are independent. This leads to the conclusion that the
probability of the particle being found in each nest cannot be
determined by the present considerations: there remain certain
degrees of freedom.

We have made this analysis for the example , but
from () it is clear that this conclusion generalizes to the
case of  all -states.
This follows from the fact that in the
inverse transformations () only two different vectors 
appear, each with a coefficient of which the square modulus is
1/2.

We summarize the results in the next proposition.

 
If the system is
in one of the -basis states  , then measurements of
the position of the oscillating particle  are such that it can
only be observed to occupy one of  the 8 nests with
coordinates
 r_k =p-q+_k ,  k=1,2,3,
on a sphere of dimensionless radius .
The probability  of finding  the
particle in the nest with coordinates
 cannot be determined. However, the
 probability of finding the particle somewhere in the four nests
with first coordinate equal to  is 1/2, and of  finding
it somewhere in the four nests with first coordinate equal to
 is also 1/2. The same holds for the second and third
coordinates.

The measurement of the momentum of the particle can take one of
the eight values
 p_k =p-q+_k ,  k=1,2,3.
Again, the individual probabilities for each of the eight
possible values of the momenta cannot be determined; but the
the probability of having  a fixed component  is 1/2, and
that of a fixed component  is also 1/2 ().

The proof of the second part of Proposition 2, related to the
probabilities of the 8 possible values () for the measurement
of the  momentum of the particle, is essentially the same as for
the coordinates. This time however, one has to use the orthonormal
basis of eigenvectors of , given by:
v_k() = 12  ( p;__k=0 - i
(-1)^_1++ _k  e^-it  p;__k=1 ),
with
_k(t)v_k() = (-1)^_k  p-q+_k 
 v_k().
The inverse relations of () are:
p;=  i^_k 2  
(-1)^(_1++_k-1 )_k  e^it _k 
( v_k(__k=0 ) + (-1)^_k  v_k(__k=1 )).
The properties deduced in this subsection are summarized in
Figure 1.


The basis vectors of  for  (atypical cases) 

So far we have considered the properties of almost all
state spaces . There are only two more cases left, namely
those with  and . We shall see in this section that
some of their physical properties are very different
from those of the typical cases, considered above.

The state space  

For , the state space  is 7-dimensional, since .
Equations () remain valid for all admissible -values (that is,
for all  with ).
This implies that also Conclusion 2 (with equations () and ())
remains valid for the admissible -values.
In this case, it is interesting to note that for the states with
, one of the operators  has zero eigenvalue.
For example, for the state  one finds
r_1^2=r_2^2=1,r_3^2=0.
Thus the third coordinate of the particle is zero. Also ,
the third component of the momentum, is zero. So the system
becomes flat, and the particle is "polarized" so as to lie in the
-plane. The oscillator behaves as a two-dimensional
object. The coordinates of the possible nests for this state are
. So there are 4 nests where
the particle can be found (see Figure 2, where a complete picture
of the possibe  states is given); similarly, it can have only four
different momenta.

The conclusions about the probabilities, formulated in Proposition 2,
remain valid, but should be modified appropriately for the
lowest energy states with .

The state space  

The state space  is 4-dimensional.
The admissible -values have .
For these admissible -values, () and Conclusion 2
remain valid.
In this case, the interesting states are those with lowest
energy with .
For these states, two of the operators  have zero eigenvalue.
For example, for the state  one finds
r_1^2=1,r_2^2=r_3^2=0.
The coordinates of the two possible nests for this state are
. Similarly,  for this
state. So the oscillating system becomes one-dimensional, the
particle is "polarized" along the -axis (see Figure 3,
where a copmplete picture of all  states is given).

For  the considerations about probabilities of finding 
the particle in one of the two nests lead to a
unique solution. For each of the states  with
, this probability is . These nests are at the opposite poles on a
sphere with radius .

Arbitrary vectors of  

So far we were studying mainly the properties of the -states.
Here we proceed to consider some properties of the coordinates and momenta
for an arbitrary state  and for any representation label .

An arbitrary vector  from the state space  can be
represented as
x=__123 p  (_1,_2,_3)p;_1,_2,_3,
where  are any complex numbers, such that
__123 p  (_1,_2,_3)^2=1.
Above and throughout
_ijk =_i +_j +_k
and  denotes a sum
over all  with the additional
restriction .
We shall be using also the polar form of  
()=()e^i () ,
where
 and .

The possible coordinates  (and momenta) of the oscillator, in an
arbitrary state , follows from the previous discussions and
the superposition principle. For clarity, let us formulate it for
 with . Then a measurement of the position of the
particle in the state  will yield one of the 64 possible nests
(see Figure 1)





The probability of finding  the particle somewhere in the eight
nests associated with  is given by
, but the probability for each nest
separately cannot be determined. Similarly, an arbitrary state
 of  can be in 44 possible nests (see Figure 2); an arbitrary state
 of  can be found in 14 possible nests (see Figure 3).

In order to give more properties of the position probabilities,
it is again necessary to expand the general state  in terms of
the orthonormalized eigenstates of . Let us do it
here explicitly for ; () and () imply:
x = _12   (
(__k=0 ) + (-1)^_1++_k-1   e^it 
(__k=1 ) ) v_k().
Then the square modulus of the coefficient in
front of  yields the probability of the
particle in the state 
being observed to
have  eigenvalue .

Many of our formulas to be presented later will look rather
complicated in the general state , so sometimes we shall
concentrate on a particular example of such a normalized state
which carries all the main features of the general picture. We
take as our standard example one of the simplest non-stationary
states (we assume that , but most of the results, apart from
the number of the nests hold for  and )
z= 12   p;0,0,0+ 12  p;0,0,1.
The consideration of such an example will help to understand
some of the peculiar features of the WQO in a general state.
Let us explicitly deduce what can be said about the position of
the particle when the system is in the state .
First of all, only two -states are involved in (),
each of these -states corresponding to 8 nests.
All of these nests are different,
so the particle can be detected in 16 possible nests.
The probability of detecting the particle somewhere in the 8 nests
corresponding to  or to  )
is ; these probabilities are just the square
moduli of the coefficients in ().

The state () of the oscillator corresponds to a configuration
in which 8 nests have value of  and
the other 8 states have  (see Figure 1). We cannot determine the
probabilities of the 16 nests separately, but we can draw
conclusions about the probability  of
detecting the particle in the nests with a given 
. To this end consider the expansion of the state 
in terms of the eigenvectors of :
z=12 (1+e^it )v_3(0,0,0)+
12 (1-e^it )v_3(0,0,1).
Then the square moduli of the coefficients give the probabilities
of finding the particle in the nests with a particular
-value. So we find:
 
&& r_3=-p  with probability   
  P (r_3=- p )= 1-(t)2 , 4.37a 

&& r_3=  p  with probability   
 P (r_3=p )= 1+(t)2 . 4.37b 

Equations () describe an interesting new phenomenon, which
does not show up whenever the oscillator is in one of the
-basis states or more generally in any stationary state ().
As it should be 
. But the probabilities are time dependent.
There is an oscillation of the probabilities: the probabilities
for  the particle to be found in the nests  either with
 or with  vary from zero to one.

Contrary to this the probabilities of  finding  the particle in
the nests with a fixed -value, or with a fixed -value
are time independent. This follows from the expansion of the
-state in terms of the eigenvectors of  and
, which yields:
P (r_1=p )=P (r_1=-p )=P (r_1=
p-1 )=P (r_1=-p-1 )=14 ,
and
P (r_2= p )=P (r_2=-p )=P (r_2=
p-1 )=P (r_2=-p-1 )=14 .
In the case of  () and () still  hold, so the
oscillations of the probabilities along the -axis  remain
unaltered. In this case however two of the 10 nests, those
associated with , are on the third axis, which
yields:
P (r_1= 1)=P (r_1= -1)=14 , P (r_1=0)= 12 ,
and
P (r_2= 1)=P (r_2= -1)=14 , P (r_2=0)= 12 .
Based on ()-() we can compute the average values of the
coordinates in the state :
 
&& r _3(t)_z =  -p   1-(t)2  +
p  1+(t)2 =
p (t).     4.42a 

&& r _1(t)_z = r _2(t)_z = 0. 4.42b 


Mean trajectories and standard deviations of
positions and momenta 

Now that we have discussed some properties of the position
operators in more general states, let us next compute the mean
trajectories or time dependent expectation values of the
coordinates and momenta and their standard deviations in a
general state . We shall then specify our results to the
stationary states . We shall indicate also (Conclusion 3)
that for the WQS there exists no (nontrivial) Heisenberg
uncertainty relations.

For the mean trajectory of the coordinates in an arbitrary
state  we obtain:
_k (t)_x &=& (x,_k(t) x)=__123 p 
(-1)^_1++ _k-1   p-q+_k 
(__k=0 ) (__k=1 ) 

&& (t
-(__k=0 )+(__k=1 )),
where as in ()  stands for the -value in
which  is replaced by  (and similarly for ).
Observe that in (), the contributions come in equal pairs;
e.g. for , the contribution coming from 
is the same as that coming from , since
 is independent of . Similarly, one finds:
_k (t)_x &=& (x,_k(t) x)= - __123 p  (-1)^_1++ _k-1   p-q+_k 
(__k=0 ) (__k=1 ) 

&& (t
-(__k=0 )+(__k=1 )).
For instance, for our standard example (), we find
 
&&_1(t)_z = 0, _2(t)_z = 0,  _3(t)_z = p   (t), 5.3a 

&&_1(t)_z =0, 
 _2(t)_z = 0,  _3(t)_z = -p   (t). 5.3b 

Note that each term in the right hand sides of
()-() contains  multiples
(_1,_2,_3)( _1, _2, _3)
such that _1+_2+_3 _1+ _2+ _3.
Therefore the right hand sides of  ()-() vanish if the system is in a
stationary state . The latter stems from the observation
that in the stationary states, see (),  is a linear
combination of basis states  with fixed
, namely all non-zero coefficients 
 in () have one and the same
. Thus we have

 
The mean trajectories of the
coordinates and momenta vanish if the system is in a
stationary state .

In order to draw conclusions about the uncertainty of the
coordinates and momenta, more precisely about their standard deviations,
we also need the mean square deviations of
 and , .
It follows from () that
_k(t)^2 _x = _k(t)^2 _x = __123 p 
 (p-q+_k) ()^2.
Recall that the general definition of the standard deviation
 of an observable  in a state  is given by
X_x =   X^2_x - X_x^2 .
So from the previous formulas one can write down the standard
deviation of  and  in an arbitrary state :
 
_k(t)_x  &=&  [__123 p 
 (p-q+_k) ()^2 -
 (__123 p 
 (-1)^_1++_k-1   p-q+_k  

&& (__k=0 ) (__k=1 )
(t
-(__k=0 )+(__k=1 ))
)^2]^1/2 , 5.7a  

_k(t)_x &=& [ __123 p 
 (p-q+_k) ()^2 - (__123 p 
 (-1)^_1++_k-1   p-q+_k  

&& (__k=0 ) (__k=1 )
(t -(__k=0 )+(__k=1 ))
)^2]^1/2 . 5.7b 
Because of the double products in the expansion of the square,
() cannot be simplified further for an arbitrary state vector
.

Let us just observe that in any one of the stationary states
 the standard deviations become very simple and are time independent:
 
&& _j(t)__0  =_j(t)__0  = p , 5.8a 

&& _j(t)__1  = _j(t)__1 
=  p-1+(_j=1,_k=_l=0)^2 p-1 , 5.8b 

&& _j(t)__2  =_j(t)__2  =
 p-1-(_j=0,_k=_l=1)^2 p-2 , 5.8c 

&& _j(t)__3  = _j(t)__3  =
p-2 , 5.8d 
where .

Although formulas () look complicated, they are
easy to apply. For instance, for our standard example (),
we find
&& _1(t)_z =_1(t)_z = _2(t)_z =_2(t)_z = 2p-1 2  , 

&& _3(t)_z = p (ot),_3(t)_z =
p (ot). Equations () can be used for independent verification of some
of the properties  of the WQOs. Consider for instance the state
. We know, see (), that in this state the
particle is polarized in the -plane, both  and
. Equation (5.7) confirms this:
_3(t)_y=_3(t)_y=0 in the state 
    y=2;1,1,0.
Let us note more generally that for any  and  there exists a state
 and a time  such that 
or . For instance
 
&& _1(0)_x_1 =0 for  x_1=12 (p;0,1,0+ p;1,1,0), 5.11a 

&& _2(0)_x_2 =0 for  x_2=12 (p;0,0,1+ p;0,1,1), 5.11b 

&& _3(0)_x_3 =0 for  x_3=12 (p;1,0,0+ p;1,0,1). 5.11c 
As an immediate consequence we have

 
The position and momentum operators of a
WQO do not satisfy an uncertainty-like relation of the form
 _k(t)_x _k(t)_x for any  holding simultaneously for all states  of
the system at all times  (as is the case for a CQO and, more
generally, for any canonical quantum system).

If however,  is any stationary state , then in the
typical case with , () yields
 _k(t)__q  = _k(t)__q  p-2 
for all . Therefore for any stationary state and any time
  _i(t)__q  _j(t)__q  p-2,
      
  _i(t)__q  _j(t)__q  p-2,
      
  _i(t)__q  _j(t)__q  p-2,
with .


Returning to the case of an arbitrary state ,
uncertainty-like relations of the type () certainly will
exist, but the uncertainty parameter  may be zero. They
can be derived from the general uncertainty relation      (t)_x (t)_x 12 
       [(t),(t)] _x ,
that applies to any two Hermitian operators  and  for any
.

Applying this in the case  and  and
the arbitrary state  as defined in () gives
   _k(t)_x  _k(t)_x       __123 p  (-1)^_k  (p-q+_k)
   ()^2
    .
It should be noted that the sign factors  are
such that cancellations may occur and may yield zero on the right
hand side, as is the case, for example, if  and  is the
state  introduced
in ().

On the other hand  if () is restricted to the stationary state
, for example, then it yields a relation very similar,
when properly dimensionalized, to the Heisenberg uncertainty
relation, namely:
   _k(t)__0  _k(t)__0     p 2  .
Formulas of the type () in the case of 
,  and
 with  are
however much more involved and will not be analyzed here systematically.
We just give a typical example illustrating the impact of the
non-commutative geometry:
_1(t)_x  _2(t)_x  && 
 12    [_1(t),_2(t)] _x  

&=&
 2p(p-1)  (0,0,0)(1,1,0)
 (2t-(0,0,0)+(1,1,0))

&& +2(p-1)(p-2)  (0,0,1)(1,1,1)
 (2t-(0,0,1)+(1,1,1))

&& +(2p-1)(1,0,0)(0,1,0)
 ((1,0,0)-(0,1,0))

&& +(2p-3)(1,0,1)(0,1,1)
 ((1,0,1)-(0,1,1))
     . Comparison with the canonical quantum oscillator 

 From the discussions so far it becomes clear that the WQOs are
very different from the Bose canonical quantum oscillators (CQOs).
Therefore it is somewhat of a surprise that one can  establish a
one-to-one correspondence between some mean trajectories of the
3D CQO  and the  mean trajectories of the WQO. This will be the
main topic of the present section.

In dimensionless units, see (), the coordinates 
and momenta  of a 3D canonical oscillator
() read:
_k(t)=b_k^+e^ i t 
+ b_k^- e^-i t  ,
_k(t)=i 
(b_k^+e^ i t 
-  b_k^- e^-i t  ).
Let us consider first a simple example. As a Bose analogue of our
standard state  we set
z = 12   0,0,0) + 12  0,0,1).
It is a simple computation to show that the mean trajectories  of
the coordinates and momenta in the state  of the Bose
oscillator read:
 
&& _1(t)_z = 0, _2(t)_z = 0,  _3(t)_z =  (t), 6.3a 

&& _1(t)_z =0, 
 _2(t)_z = 0,  _3(t)_z = - (t). 6.3b 
The above trajectories are the same as those of the WQO given in
() provided in the latter that . This was the first
indication that some of the trajectories of the WQO are the same
as those of the canonical Bose oscillator. The question is  how
far does this similarity go. In the next proposition we summarize
the results which we are able to establish.

 
To each  mean trajectory in the
phase space of the Wigner quantum oscillator there corresponds an
identical trajectory of the 3D Bose canonical quantum oscillator.

Let . By a straightforward computation one shows
that the mean trajectory of the WQO in the state
x=(0,0,0)1;0,0,0+(1,0,0)1;1,0,0+(0,1,0)1;0,1,0+(0,0,1)1;0,0,1is the same as the mean trajectory of the Bose oscillator
in the state
x^*=(0,0,0)^*0,0,0)+(1,0,0)^*1,0,0)+(0,1,0)^*0,1,0)
+(0,0,1)^*0,0,1).
The  in the right hand side of () denotes complex conjugation.

Explicitly the mean trajectories corresponding to () and
() read:
) 
&& _k) (t)_x  = _k) (t)_x^*) 
 = 2   (0,0,0)(0,0,0)__k=1) 
  (t + (0,0,0)__k=1)  -
  (0,0,0)), 

&& 6.6a) 

&& _k) (t)_x  = _k) (t)_x^*) 
 = - 2   (0,0,0)(0,0,0)__k=1) 
  (t + (0,0,0)__k=1)  -
  (0,0,0)), 

&& 6.6b) 
where  denotes , ,
 according as , respectively.

However, although the standard deviations of the coordinates and
momenta of the WQO in a state  and of the CQO in a state 
also look somewhat similar, they  are in fact different:
&WQO:) & _k(t)_x =[(0,0,0)^2 +

&CQO:) & _1(t)_z^*) =_2(t)_z^*) = 1, _3(t)_z^*) =(1+^2(ot))^1/2) . Let us go further and compare the standard deviations
corresponding to the state  and its Bose
"partner" .
& WQO:) & _1(t)_y=_1(t)_y=1,_k(t)_y=_k(t)_y=0,  k=1,2, 

& CQO:) & _1(t)_y^*) =_1(t)_y^*)

Equation () confirms that the oscillator in the state
 "lives" on the -axis. This is not the case
for the CQO,  either in the state  or in any other
state, since the right hand side of  () never vanishes, as is implied
also by the Heisenberg uncertainty relations.

We have compared also the sizes of the WQO and
CQO corresponding
to the basis states. For the CQO
) (t)^2 = _k=1) ^3
((b_k^+)^2 e^2it)  +
b_k^+,b_k^- + (b_k^-)^2 e^-2it) )
is not an integral of motion. However for  the average value of

) (t)^2_x^*) =5 - 2(0,0,0)^2.
Thus we have
& WQO:) & ) (t)^2_1;0,0,0) =3,  
) (t)^2_1;1,0,0) =) (t)^2_1;0,1,0) =

) (t)^2_0,1,0)) = ) (t)^2_0,0,1)) =5.
Thus only the states  of the WQO and  of the
CQO have one and the same space dimensions. This is perhaps not
surprising since only these states have  one and the same energy
 (in units of ). The energy of the other
WQO states is 1, whereas for the other CQO states it is 5.


Concluding remarks) 

It is clear that while alternative, non-canonical solutions to the
compatibility equations () between Hamilton's equations and the
Heisenberg equations exist in our  WQO model, they are
in several very important respects quite different from the
canonical solutions.

Firstly, each state space  of our one particle 3D WQO is
finite-dimensional; 8-dimensional in the case of typical
representations of , and either  or -dimensional
in the case of atypical representations.

Secondly, both the energy and the angular momentum are quantized,
with equally spaced energy levels, all positive and with
separation , and with the angular momentum
restricted to be  or . Since there are only a finite number
of energy levels, the energy is bounded. The degeneracies are
always either  or . The lowest energy state is
non-degenerate in all the typical cases, but degenerate in each of
the atypical cases.

Thirdly, the spectrum of coordinates is also quantized, to the
extent that in any stationary state measurements of the
coordinates ,  and  give values consistent only
with the particle being found at a finite number of possible
sites, namely the various nests that we have identified. In the
typical,  case, the number of possible nests is , while
in the atypical cases it is  if  and only  if .
In all cases the distance of the particle from the origin is
bounded and may take on only the values
 with  such that
.

Fourthly, not only is the mean trajectory of the particle in any
stationary state zero, but there exist both typical and atypical
states for which the standard deviation of some coordinate ,
or some component of linear momentum , is also zero. This
implies that for the WQO there exists no uncertainty relation
involving a non-zero uncertainty parameter  that applies
to all states at all times.

Fifthly, the atypical case is distinguished from the typical case
in possessing stationary states of dimension lower than three,
namely two-dimensional in the case  and one-dimensional in
the case .

Many of these non-standard results are a consequence of the fact
that the underlying geometry of this WQO model is
non-commutative. This means that their interpretation must be
undertaken carefully. In particular it should be stressed that it
is not possible to specify precisely the position of the particle.
Fortunately, the square operators , 
and  not only mutually commute but also commute with the
Hamiltonian. Their common eigenstates are the stationary states
, for which the eigenvalues of , 
and  are simultaneously  fixed to be either ,  or .
Thus the spectrum of the measured values of each of the
coordinates themselves, ,  and , is necessarily
restricted to the set of values , 
and . Any measurement of a coordinate,  say,
results in one or other of the allowed positive or negative
values of  with, as we have shown, equal probability,
leaving the signs of the other coordinates undetermined. Thus the
particle in a stationary state  has a certain
probability of being within one or other of the relevant nests,
but it is not to be thought of as localized in any particular
nest.

In this article we have restricted ourselves to the relatively
simple case of an , single particle 3-dimensional WQO with a
relatively low, -dimensional Fock space  associated
with typical irreducible representations of , and even
lower dimensions for atypical representations. A very natural
next step is to generalize the results to the case of an -body
3-dimensional WQO as introduced in . In such a case the
dimension of the Fock space is -dimensional for typical
representations, and again lower dimensions for atypical
representations. The relevant calculations are somewhat intricate
and will be the subject of a separate article, in which the
restriction from the Lie superalgebra  to the simple Lie
algebra  of the rotation group plays a key role in the
determination of the possible angular momentum states of our
multiparticle system. It suffices to say at this stage that not
only are the energy and angular momentum quantized and bounded
but, in the corresponding stationary states of fixed energy and
angular momentum, so are the single particle coordinates and
components of linear momentum. As is to be expected the
corresponding nest structure is more complicated and we have to
contend with the relevant class  statistics, and account for
the numbers of particles whose coordinates, when measured, can
coincide with those of the nests, as well as more complicated
patterns of degeneracy.

Further generalizations also come to mind. In particular the
class of irreducible representations considered here are those
specified by the parameter . There exist other
finite-dimensional irreducible representations of , and
more generally of , that are specified not just by a
single positive integer , but by a partition or equivalently a
sequence of Kac-Dynkin indices . These can be expected to
provide other interesting models of the Wigner quantum oscillator
in the one-particle case and, more particularly, in
multi-particle cases. At the same time it would be interesting to
explore in the same way other non-oscillator Wigner quantum systems.
