We derive
anticommutators of supercharges 
with a brane charge 
for
a D-particle
 in  AdSS and  pp-wave backgrounds.
A coset  and its Penrose limit are
used with the supermatrix-valued coordinates
for the AdS and the pp-wave spaces respectively.
The brane charges have position dependence, 
and can be absorbed into bosonic generators by shift of momenta
which results in closure of the superalgebras.

 Introduction Recently brane dynamics in curved backgrounds are
examined extensively
motivated by the AdS/CFT correspondence 
and its pp-wave limit and.
The study of superstrings in AdS spaces has been started 
in earlier works,
and further developed to pp-wave spacesand to D-branes. 
Branes are characterized by brane charges
 in superalgebras 
which are topological.
Superalgebras manifest
non-perturbative dualities and present solitonic solutions
systematically.
In general a superalgebra is uniquely obtained coordinate independently,
 while Killing spinor equations are coordinate dependent 
where there are several different coordinate systems in curved spaces.
So it will  give better outlook to examine 
superalgebras with brane charges in curved spaces also.
For a flat background -brane charges are center,
and classified by non-trivial elements of the Chevalley-Eilenberg (CE) cohomology
.
However it is unclear whether these properties are common in curved spaces;
any -form charges (except scalars) can not be centers
in these backgrounds,
and string charges in AdS space are given as trivial elements of CE cohomology
. 


There are several attempts to evaluate brane charges 
in superalgebras
 in the matrix theory approach for pp-wave backgrounds in 
earlier works and in and
in the Green-Schwarz type action approach for the AdS space,
where new contributions to brane charges are obtained
in addition to the flat part.
It is desirable to have  background dependence of a brane charge,
since a brane charge is proportinal to a brane volume 
which depends on a background. 
However these brane charges are not allowed by
the central extension of the superalgebra.
Possible extension of the super-AdS algebra is also discussed.
In order to clarify background dependence of a brane charge
and consistency of superalgebras,
we analyze a simple case  and show how these issues incorporate.
We use the supermatrix-valued coordinates
introduced in "supertwistor formulation"and compute brane charges analogously to.
We take a D0-brane case in the AdSSwhich is the near horizon geometry of the Reissner-Nordstrm
black hole in four dimensions.
Its pp-wave limit and a flat limit are also examined. 

The organization of this paper is as follows.
In section 2.1, we explain the coset construction 
of the Wick rotated AdSS space
 which is expressed by a coset 
.    
Its Penrose limit is taken for
the bosonic part of  AdSS 
in section 2.2
and for whole part in section 2.3.
In section 3 an action for a D0-brane in the
AdSS space is given. 
The pseudo-supersymmetric WZ term is 
confirmed to satisfy three criteria;
1. its exterior derivative
to be correct two-form field strength, 
2. kappa-invariance of the action,
3. correct flat limit. 
Its pp-wave limit and a flat limit
are also given.
In section 4 supercharges are obtained and 
brane charges are calculated by anticommutators 
of these supercharges.
The BPS condition and the BPS mass are also discussed. 





 Super-AdSS and its Penrose limit   Branes in the super-AdSS background is expressed by the
coset 
SU(1,1 2)/SO(1,1)SO(2)  GL(2 2)/(GL(1))^4

where  Wick rotations are performed and scaling degrees of freedom are introduced.
An element of the coset is denoted by  with indices  for 
 and indices  for .
Two 's are Lorentz groups of 
two 2-dimensional pseudospheres and other two 's
are dilatations. 
At first we examine the bosonic part
of the AdSS space,
, in section 2.1  
and take the Penrose limit
to derive the pp-wave metric in section 2.2.
The Penrose limit of the whole supergroup 
is presented in section 2.3.

 AdSS 

 The bosonic part
of the AdSS space is
.
Coset elements   and 
correspond to a coset  
for AdS and another one for
S respectively.
The left-invariant (LI) one forms are given by
j_a ^b=z_a ^mdz_m ^b  ,  
j_a   ^b  =z_a   ^m  dz_m   ^b  
where  and  are inverse of 
 and .
These indices are contracted with the Lorentz invariant metric
 and 
and the Lorentz  is 
assigned to .
A LI current  is decomposed into three parts;
a trace part ,
a traceless symmetric part 
and an antisymmetric part ,
j_ab 
=1 2 _ab j+j_ab 
+j_[ab]    .

If the following parameterization is chosen
z_m ^a=R_m^a +(
 
)whose inverse is
z_a ^m=1 R^2-(x^0)^2-(x^1)^2 [
R_a^m -(
 
)]   ,
then the LI one forms are given by
j_ab 
=R R^2-_(x^)^2 (
 
)   .

The metric of this Wick rotated AdSS is given by
ds^2_"AdS _2S ^2" &=&
-1 2 (
j_ab j^ab -j_a b  j^a b  )


&=&-R^2 [R^2-_(x^)^2]^2 _(dx^)^2
+R^2 [R^2-_(x^)^2]^2 _(dx^)^2
expressing two 2-dimensional pseudospheres with the same unit curvature,
where the supersymmetry is imposed to restrict  curvatures to be same.

 Penrose limit of AdSS   

Under the global  which is generated by 's
G_m ^n=z_m ^a_a ^n   ,  
[z_m ^a,_b ^n]=_b^a_m^n  ,  
[G_m ^n,G_l ^k
]=-_l^nG_m ^k+_m^kG_l ^n
with the conjugate momenta 's,
a contravariant vector 
w_mn =z_m  ^az_n   _ais transformed as
_w_mn =[w_ mn ,_k ^lG_l ^k]
=_m  ^l w_ln 
+_n  ^l w_lm 
   .

If we parameterize  as bosonz ,
 becomes
w_mn =

2R(
 
)      .

So the  generators are parameterized as
G^mn =
(
 
)      ,
where  are dilatation, translations, Lorentz generators
respectively. The same parameterization is chosen 
for another  generators 
with replacing  by . 



The Penrose limit is taken as follows:
Introduce the lightcone variables and scale them with the
parameter  then take a limit 
&&P_1 2  (P_3P_0)


&&P_+^-2 P_+  ,  
(P_i, M_01 , M_32 )^-1 (P_i, M_01 , M_32 ) _i=1,2  ,  
(P_-, D)(P_-, D)and therefore
x^ =1 2  (x^3x^0)  ,  
x^+^2 x^+ , x^ix^i , 
x^-x^-  .The metric dsads , which is scaled as  and omit 
prime from now on,
 becomes  
ds^2_pp &=&^-2 (-1 2 )[
(j^ab )^2-(j^a b  )^2]_rescaling pomg , 0 .


&=&R^2 [R^2-1 2 x^- ^2]^2

2dx^+dx^-+_i=1,2 (x^i)^2 
R^2-1 2 (x^- )^2 
(dx^-)^2

with . 
After field redefinition
 .  ,spp1  recast into the familiar form
ds^2_pp &=&2dX^+X^-+_i=1,2 (dX^i)^2
+2 R^2 _i=1,2 (X^i)^2(dX^-)^2  .
A flat limit is taken by rescaling  and
  then .
The metric dsads  has already dilatation scale  exists
which is identified to the raduis of the curvature,
ds^2_flat &=&
R^2(-1 2 )
[j_ab j^ab 
-j_a b  j^a b  ]. _R 


&=&-1 [1-_(x^/R)^2]^2 _(dx^)^2
+1 [1-_(x^/R)^2]^2 _(dx^)^2
. _R 

&=&_
 Penrose limit of super-AdSS 


Now we consider a coset 
whose element is denoted by ,
 and the supergroup  is generated by
&&G_M ^N=Z_N ^A_A ^N   ,  [Z_M ^A,_B ^N
=(-1)^A_B^A_M^N 

&&[G_M ^N,G_L ^K
=(-1)^N(-_L^NG_M ^K+_M^KG_L ^N)   
where conjugate momenta 's are introduced.
Corresponding to that bosonic lightcone generators are defined as
ppomega  for generators of   bosonG , 
fermionic lightcone generators are identified from
the above algebra;
for example, 
  

,

 

 and so on.
A center  can be neglected.
Whole identification of 
lightcone generators with
  is given as follows:
 

 
where  and
. 
The Penrose limit is given by rescaling
ppomega  and 
Q_+^-1  Q_+  ,  Q_-Q_-   ,
or equivalently rescaling of
  generators 
as follows 

 
and taking the limit .

 Super-D0-brane actions The action of a super-D0-brane in AdSS is given inand we reformulate this into the "supertwistor formulation"
in this section.
We must construct the WZ term with taking care of the boundary term 
to obtain brane charges.
In section 3.1 we present a general argument
of the pseudo-supersymmetric WZ term.
Then the super-D0-brane action is examined explicitly in section 3.2.

 WZ term for a -brane 

In order to compute a brane charge by the anticommutator of 
supercharges we need to construct the pseudo-supersymmetric WZ term. 
For an group element, ,
it can be parameterized generally as



whose inverse is 


.
A left-invariant (LI) one form current is given as
J=Z^-1 dZ=_n=0 ^ (-X)^n dX   ,
satisfying the Maurer-Cartan equation,


. 
The right hand side of the integration of the Maurer-Cartan equation is calculated as
-JJ=d(_n=1 ^ (-X)^n dX)
=_n=1 ^ (-X)^n dX+boundary term    .
   
Its left-invariance requires
"", so 
"".
On the other hand  the "pseudo"-left-invariant one form is
-_P.L.I.  JJ=J-dX   .
For super--branes the Wess-Zumino (WZ) term is given as
the one-dimensional higher space integration of 
LI  form currents  
L _WZ =B_[p+1] =_P.L.I.  H_[p+2]   ,  H_[p+2] =J^p+2    ,
which is pseudo-supersymmetry invariant producing 
the topological -brane charge.
This pseudo-invariance corresponds to
the choice of the boundary term of the integration to be zero.
If a LI  form current exists


 with ,  
the pseudo-invariant -form is given byL _WZ =B_[p+1] =B _[p+1] -d(X(dX)^p)  .The super-AdS group and the nondegenerate supertranslation group
are the cases where  exists. 
For the nondegenerate supertranslation group
there exists the LI 2-form current
B _[2] =J_Q  J_Q   ,  dB _[2] =H_[3] =J_QJ_PJ_Q
where  is introduced to make a nondegenerate
fermionic group metric  and satisfies

.
The WZ term for a superstring in a flat space is given by
L _WZ =B_[2] =B _[2] -d(X_Q  dX_Q )   .
The auxiliary variable  is not 
contained in the kinetic term, 
so this can be gauged away in this case.
 
 
Now let us go back to the curved background cases. 
The supercoset construction is obtained by 
replacing bosonic currents jjbar 
with supercurrents 
J_A ^B=Z_A ^MdZ_M ^B  ,  Z_M ^A=
(
 
)
+
(
 
)   .
All components are contained in  and ,
especially the antisymmetric part
plays a role of auxiliary variables. 
The action for a D-brane is given by
I_D p &=&T d^p+1 (L _DBI +L _WZ )

where the Dirac-Born-Infeld term is given as
L _DBI =-(g_rs +F _rs )   ,  
g_rs =(J_r^ab J_ab,s 
-J_r^a b  J_a b ,s )/tr 1 
  
with
 , ,
the tension  and the DBI field strength .
The WZ term in super-AdS spaces has the form of LWZp  and it
 must satisfy following three criteria;
 
Its exterior derivative produces the 
correct field strength,  with . 
The action is kappa-symmetric. 
Its flat limit reduces into  the correct flat WZ term. 







 Super-D0-brane action 



The action for a D0 brane is given as
I_D0 &=&d (L _DBI,D0  +L _WZ,D0  )

L _DBI,D0  &=&T g_00  
  ,  g_00 =(J_0^ab J_ab,0 
-J_0^a b  J_a b ,0 )/2


L _WZ,D0  &=&K_ab (J_0^ab -d(^am X_m ^b))
+K _a b  
(J_0^a b  -d(^a m  X _m   ^b  )
)

   
where  and  are determined by the kappa-symmetry as
T^2=K^2+K ^2   which agrees with Zhou's result.

This WZ term satisfies three criteria:
The criterion 1. is confirmed easier.
 The two-form RR-field strength for a D0-brane is given by
H_[2] =dL _WZ =-K_ab 
(J^ac J_c ^b+J^ac  J_c   ^b)
+K _a b  
(J^a c J_c ^b  +J^a c  J_c   ^b  )
where index  of  has been omitted. 
The field strength  in a flat space 
contains  bilinear of fermionic indices currents
only. On the other hand the one in AdSS 
space contains bilinear of not only the fermionic indices currents 
but also the bosonic indices currents in order to make closed form 
.
For the expression of  in D0act  
this closure is trivial, i.e. .


The criterion 2. is calculated as follows:
If we introduce the following combination for 
an arbitrary variation 
J^AB =Z^AM Z_M ^B  ,
the kappa-variation is characterized by vanishing bosonic components
_  J^ab =0=_  J^a b     
as usual. In particular in this parameterization
 and
 
(
In the canonical computation the fermionic constraints 
are given asD _a b =D_a b +L _WZ   _m ^a   
X_m ^b=0  ,  
D _ab  =D_ab  +L _WZ    _m   ^a 
X _m   ^b  =0  
with the local  generators, 's.
The kappa-variation is 
generated by these fermionic constraints 
_  O 
=[O ,F_a b  ^ba  +F_ab   ^b a 
]


   ,   
_  Z_M ^b=Z_M ^a    _a   ^b  ,  
_  Z_M ^b  =Z_M ^a   _a  ^b    
with these parameters are projected into half.
) .
Using the kappa-variation of currents, 
_  J^ab &=&J^ac  _  J_c   ^b
-(_  J^ac  )J_c   ^band the similar for the , 
the kappa-variation of the D0-brane action D0act  
becomes
_ L _DBI &=&T g_00   

_  J_ab   
(J^ac J^b   _c-J^c b  J_c   ^a)
+_  J_a b   
(J^cb J_c ^a  -J^a b  J^b _b  )




_ L _WZ &=&-
_  J_ab   
(K^ab J^b   _b+K ^a b  J_a   ^a)
-_  J_a b   
(K^ab J_a ^a  +K ^a b  J^b _b  )
   .
The kappa-invariance of the action leads to
_ (L _DBI +L _WZ )&=&
(_  J_ab  J_c d 
+_  J_c d J_ab  )
P ^ab c d 

P ^ab c d &=&
T g_00   (J^ad ^b c  -

-(K^ad ^b c  
+K ^ad ^c b  )

0&=&P ^ab c d _  J_ab  =
P ^ab c d _  J_c d 
  .
Equivalently projected kappa-parameters


 with the relation Tkkbar .


The criterion 3. is evaluated as follows:
Under the flat limit which is obtained by rescaling, 
,  and
 as well as ,
and  ,
the WZ term D0act  reduces into
:
L _WZ,flat  &=&-
K_ab  ^m a  d  _m   ^b
+_a b  
 ^m a   d  _m   ^b  where  is imposed by requiring 4-dimensional
covariance and this is consistent with.


The WZ term for a D0-brane in the pp-wave background is obtained by
taking the Penrose limit given in pptbl .
The WZ term is scaled under the Penrose limit as

as well as the DBI term .
Since the antisymmetric components of currents and parameters


are scaled as
, 
, 
all terms in  are survived. 
The LI current after taking the Penrose limit, 
which is still complicated function of  
and ,
is denoted as .
Then the WZ term is written as
L _WZ,pp  
&=&K_ab (J_pp  ^ab -d(^am X_m ^b))
+K _a b  
(J_pp  ^a b  -d(^a m  X _m   ^b  )
)
   .


 D0-brane charges The Noether charges of global  symmetry with parameters 
are modified under the existence of the WZ term^NM G_MN   ^NM G _MN =^NM G_MN -U_  ,  
_L =dU_WZ    .

Because of ,
 only the total derivative terms in the WZ term in D0act  contribute to 
which is given as
U_ &=&-(
K_ab ^am _X_m ^b
+K _a b  ^a m  _X _m   ^b  
)  ,

_Z_M ^A&=&_M ^L Z_L ^A   .
This modified  generators are then expressed as
&&G _MN =G_MN +T _MN 

&& .    ,
and also re-expressed as
&&G _MN =Z_M ^A _AN 

&& .satisfying the same algebra of  (
We thank Kiyoshi Kamimura for pointing out that a total derivative term
does not change the global symmetry algebra.) .
Under the existence of the WZ term  Noether charges 
 are conserved and generate the closed superalgebra. 
Fermionic parts are identified as supercharges as
,
 ,

while bosonic parts are interpreted as sum of the 
bosonic charges  and 
topological charges 
conventionally.
Therefore commutators of supercharges for a D0-brane in the AdSS background
are given by
Q_AdS ,Q_AdS &=&0=Q _AdS ,Q _AdS 

 Q _AdS ,m   ^n, Q_AdS ,l  ^k  
&=& Q_AdS ,l  ^k   , Q _AdS ,m   ^n 
 
&=&
-_l^n
(P_m   ^k  +M _m   ^k  +T _m   ^k  )
+_m  ^k  (P_l ^n+M_l ^n+T _l ^n)
+_l^n_m  ^k  (D -D)
  where a center  can be ignored.
The D0-brane charges are  and .
They have position dependence so they are not center.
The generators of this algebra are 
rather  
than .






Under the flat limit 
contributions from the WZ term are given as
 .
  and imposing four-dimensional symmetry leads to . 
The commutators of supercharges SUSYads 
reduce into
as
Q_flat ,Q_flat &=&0=Q _flat ,Q _flat 

Q _flat,  _m   ^n,Q_flat,  _l ^k  
&=&Q_flat,  _l ^k  ,Q _flat,  _m   ^n

&=&
-_l^n(P_m   ^k  +T _flat ,m   ^k  )
+_m  ^k  (P_l ^n+T _flat ,l  ^n)   .
This is the supertranslation algebra
with a center for the D0-brane.



Under the Penrose limit pptbl  
contributions from the WZ term are given as

 .The anticommutator 


satisfies the same relation with the last equation of SUSYpp 
with opposite lightcone projection.
This is the anticommutators of supercharges for a D0-brane 
in the 2+2 dimensional pp-wave background,
where the super-pp-algebra part is consistent with by setting a center  
to be zero. 
The D0-brane charge in the pp-wave background is independent 
on  but depend on 's () and 
 ( in the lightcone gauge).
In the lightcone gauge all
supersymmetries are broken except ,
since   are broken because of 
and   are also broken for .






In order to examine the BPS condition let us compare with
the case of a D0-brane in a flat space. 
The supercharge  and the fermionic constraint  
satisfy the following anticommutators&&Q_,Q_=-2C(P_^11 )
= -2M_BPS P _+, 

&&      .

&&D _,D _=2C(P_^11 )= 
2M_BPS P _+, 

&&      .with . 
The right hand side of  is the BPS projection operator
while the one of  is the kappa-symmetry projection operator.
For a particle case they coincide, but in general they are 
  similar  but not equal.
The BPS projection operator is 
and the BPS mass is .



In flat space (mass) classifies BPS states. 
In curved space a quadratic Casimir operator ,
which is the background  covariant Hamiltonian, 
corresponds to (mass). 
The quadratic Casimir operator  in the super-AdS and the super-pp-wave
spaces are given as and
 
where  are translation, Lorentz rotation,
boost parts of the Lorentz rotation generators respectively.
In cases of AdSS and four-dimensional pp-wave space, 
 .
Analogously to QQDD  
the BPS projection operator  is obtained from 
the right hand side of the anticommutator of supercharges
SUSYads  in the Majorana supercharge basis Q_, Q_
&&-2c_[2]  P _+,    ,
and the quadratic Casimir is bounded below
c_[2] K^2+K ^2=T^2   .If a D0-brane in a ground state 
has only non-zero value in   component
and is located at the origin, 
the BPS projection operator is given as
P _+, =1 -_IJ (
K K^2+K ^2  
_01 
+K  K^2+K ^2  
_0 )
where  for   and 
are gamma-matrices for AdS and S spaces and 
and .
It can be seen that a D0-brane is a 1/2 supersymmetry preserving BPS state.
For the four dimensional pp-wave background limit
this form stays the same for a D0-brane.
For the flat limit two kappa-coefficients become equal , 
and reduce into the similar form with QQDD .


 Conclusions We have shown that in curved backgrounds
Noether charges are also modified by the WZ term, 
and anticommutators of fermionic Noether charges  produce a brane charge.
The -form field strength is no longer a trivial element of 
CE cohomology after subtracting the total derivative term from the 
super-invariant WZ term.
The brane charge in the anticommutator of supercharges
is not a center,
but can be absorbed into the bosonic generators
and then the algebra closes.


The commutators of supercharges for a D0-brane in the AdSS  
and in the pp-wave limit 
are given in SUSYads  and
SUSYpp , and brane charges are given in
calT  and calTpp .
These contributions from the WZ term 
are absorbed  in conjugate momenta,
and the resultant algebras are the same algebra with the original
super-AdSS/super-pp-wave algebras.
The brane charges have position dependence;  dependence in the AdS,
 dependence in the pp-wave limit and
no position dependence in a flat limit.
In the lightcone gauge, where  then 's are broken,  
the dynamical supercharges  are preserved 
 only for  as discussed in.
In the static  gauge half supersymmetry condition 
is given by the BPS projection  
where the square of the quadratic Casimir  is bounded below 
with the value . 
It is natural to expect the above properties for general -branes.

It is also important to examine 
general brane configurations. 
This background covariant approach presents 
more general description including a D0-brane,
which is excluded in the lightcone gauge approach
since the lightcone gauge restricts  to be Neumann boundary condition.
Toward better understanding of D-branes, dualities,
 gauge theory correspondence and quantum theories 
further studies are required.
