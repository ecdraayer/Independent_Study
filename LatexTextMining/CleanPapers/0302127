We study superstring theories on the Penrose limit of 
the enhanc on geometry realized by 
the -branes wrapped on a  surface.
We first examine the null geodesics with fixed radius 
in general brane backgrounds, which  give solvable superstring 
theories with constant masses. In most cases, the superstring 
theories contain negative mass-squared.
We clarify a condition that the world-sheet free fields 
have positive mass-squared.
We then apply this condition to the enhanc on geometry and 
find that the null geodesics with fixed radius exist
only for  case.
They define the superstring theories with positive
mass-squared.
For  case, we show that there is no null geodesic with fixed
radius.
We also discuss the decoupling limit
which gives the dual geometry of super Yang-Mills theory
with 8 supercharges. We discuss the -volume 
dependence of the superstring spectrum.



Introduction 

The work of Berenstein, Maldacena and Nastase 
(BMN)made a major step for understanding the
holographic correspondence of string theory
and gauge theories.
Superstring theory on the maximally supersymmetric
plane wave , which is given by the Penrose 
limit  of , 
is exactly solvable . 
Based on this result and 
the AdS/CFT correspondence ,
BMN identified the string states on the 

plane wave background as certain
sectors of the ,  super Yang-Mills theory.
Supersymmetric gauge theories with conformal invariance but
less supersymmetry
has been also investigated 
extensively -.




It is an interesting problem to explore 
holographic correspondences for 
non-conformal gauge theories
using string theories on brane backgrounds. 
In a previous paper , Fuji and the present 
authors have studied string theories on the Penrose limits of the
brane solutions including the D-brane,  fivebrane and
 string solutions. We have solved exactly
the equations of motion of bosonic strings
on certain backgrounds, which have time-dependent masses.
Aspects of the quantization of strings
on time-dependent plane wave backgrounds are
discussed in refs. .

String theories on the Penrose limits
of brane solutions and the possible connections to 
the gauge theories have been studied in the works such as
ref.  for the D-branes, 
and refs.  for the
fivebrane solutions. 
The Pilch-Warner solution , which provides the
dual of the RG flow from the  super
Yang-Mills theory to the superconformal 
 theory of Leigh and Strassler , 
have been studied in the Penrose limit . 
String theories were analyzed near the region of the
geometry corresponding to the IR fixed point.


Recently,  Gimon et.al.  
studied the Maldacena-Nu n ez  and 
the Klebanov-Strassler  solutions, 
which are dual to  theories. 
They considered the Penrose limit along a special class 
of null geodesics which give solvable string theories.
It was argued that the string spectrum represent 
hadrons in the IR limit of the gauge theories.

In this paper, we study geometries
which are dual to super Yang-Mills theories  
with 8 supercharges.
The brane system corresponds to the 
D-branes wrapped on , which is described by
the 'enhanc on' geometry.
When D-branes are wrapped on , 
the curvature of the  induces negative D-brane charges.
In the supergravity, they are effectively described by a
geometry which is similar to the 
D--brane system. 
This geometry is valid outside the 
'enhanc on radius'. Inside the radius,
we have flat space.  
It is proposed that this enhanc on geometry
is dual to the -dimensional 
super Yang-Mills theory. 
As a result of the  compactification, the gauge theory
has half the maximal supersymmetry, and contain the massless
fields which are the same as 
the , =2 super Yang-Mills theory 
with no hypermultiplets.

We study superstring theory on the Penrose limit of 
enhanc on geometry. 
We investigate the general null geodesics of the 
enhanc on geometry for D-branes wrapped on .
Our particular interest is the special null geodesics 
such that the radial transverse coordinate is fixed.
The Penrose limit along such geodesics 
gives plane waves on which the light-cone
string theory has constant masses.

In recent studies , 
it has been noted that 
many plane wave backgrounds which are obtained 
by the Penrose limits yield
string theories which have negative mass-squared. 
Although stability analysis based on supergravity suggests
the background is stable, it is difficult to make 
sense of those string theories which have 
instability on the world-sheet. 
The ground state of the string would be a stretched
configuration due to the tidal force of the brane
background . 
In this paper, we add an
example of string theory where all the mass-squared 
are non-negative.  In such a case, 
we expect that the string spectrum and their interpretation
in terms of the gauge theory are clearly understood.


On the enhanc on geometry, 
we find that the null geodesics with constant radius
exist only for the  case (D4-branes wrapped on ).
Moreover, in this case, we obtain a superstring theory 
whose mass-squared are all non-negative. 
We will calculate the superstring spectrum 
based on the light-cone Hamiltonian.
By taking the decoupling limit, we can discuss the 
correspondence with the gauge theory. 
In the present work, however,
we do not discuss correspondence between 
string states and gauge-theory operators.
We argue that our results of the string theory should
give information on the gauge theory 
in the large  limit with large effective 't Hooft coupling.
We also note a qualitative behavior of the string spectrum
as the volume of  varies. 
For  cases, we show that 
null geodesic with constant radius does not exist.

This paper is organized as follows. 
We first review the enhanc on geometry in section 2. 
In section 3, we discuss 
the null geodesic with constant radius 
in general brane backgrounds
and the Penrose limit along such a geodesic. 
In section 4, we examine null geodesics in 
the enhanc on geometry associated with
D-branes wrapped on . 
We take the Penrose limit along the geodesic with
constant radius for  the  case.
In section 5, we study
the spectrum of the superstring theory in this Penrose limit.
Discussion on the dual gauge theory is given in section 6.
Conclusions and discussion are in section 7.

We include an Appendix, in which we apply the 
general discussion 
on the null geodesics with constant radius
to other brane solutions.
We analyze D-brane,  fivebrane, 
 string solutions, which have been treated 
in the previous paper .
The conditions for the existence of the null geodesics 
with constant radius on these backgrounds are 
carefully reexamined. 



Enhanc on geometry 

We begin with  a brief review on the
enhanc on geometry. 
When D-branes are wrapped on the whole , 
the curvature of the  induces one unit of 
negative D-brane charge per one D-brane. 
The supergravity solution which describes this system
in the string frame is given 
as follows  
where   are the coordinates along 
the brane other than those wrapped on the .  is the
radial coordinate in the transverse -dimensional space.
 denotes the RR -form, and  is the dilaton.
The string coupling at the infinity is given by .
 is the metric of the  with unit volume, 
 is the 
corresponding volume form, and the constant  is 
the volume of  measured at the infinity.  
The parameters  and , which are
positive, are given by
 
where 
and  is the number of the D-branes.
We will consider the cases of . 

As explained in ref. ,
this geometry is valid outside the 'enhanc on 
radius' . The D-branes form a shell 
at the enhanc on radius,
and the geometry inside is replaced with the flat space.
A way to find  is to consider a 
probe D-brane (also wrapped on ). 
The enhanc on radius is determined as 
the radius at which the tension
of the probe brane vanishes. 
Following the arguments in refs. , 
we have
 
The metric () has
a naked singularity called the
'repulson singularity' at ,
where repulsive force on a test particle diverges, 
but it is removed since 
the singularity is in the unphysical 
region .

It is proposed that the decoupling limit of 
this geometry is dual to super Yang-Mills theory  with 
8 supercharges. The decoupling
limit is given by replacing  and  
in () with
 
This is obtained  from the full geometry by 
taking  with .
In other words, this corresponds to a 
'near-shell limit' with  taken large. 
Also note that the enhanc on radius for the metric 
in the decoupling limit is  given by
.

Null geodesics with constant radius in general 
brane backgrounds 

The main purpose of this paper is to study enhanc on
geometry in the Penrose limit along null geodesics which 
stay at constant radius. 
Before beginning to study the enhanc on geometry,
we shall discuss some general properties of the null 
geodesics with constant radius. 
Assuming that the metric takes the form 
of generic brane solutions,
we derive the condition for the existence of the null 
geodesic with constant radius. We then obtain the formula
for the Penrose limit along such a geodesic.

Geodesic equations 

Let us consider generic brane solutions in  
spacetime dimensions,
which are static, rotationally symmetric in the transverse space, 
and homogeneous in the spatial directions 
along the brane:
 
where  are the coordinates 
along the branes.
, ,  and  are functions
of the transverse radial distance . 
Here, 
is the metric of the unit sphere . 
We will use the following parametrization of :
 

We consider null geodesics in the  space.
A null geodesic is given by the trajectory of 
a test particle with the action
 
and the massless constraint 
 
where . 

From the equations of motion for  and , 
we see that the energy  and 
the angular momentum
 are conserved.
We rescale  and 
normalize the energy to one. Then, we have
 
where .
The massless constraint becomes
 
The velocity in the radial direction  is
determined as
 
Since , () gives
the region of , which is determined by
 

The points where the equality in () holds
are generically the turning points of the geodesic.
The direction to which the geodesic turns is determined
by the second time-derivative  at that point.
 From the equation of motion for :
 
we obtain
 
where .

We may consider a geodesic which stays at a fixed
radius when  and  are adjusted such that 
 are satisfied. 
From () and (), we find
that the fixed radius conditions are given by
 
It is useful to define the function
 
The conditions () are equivalent to
 
if .


Penrose limit along a null geodesic with constant radius 
When a null geodesic  stays at a constant radius,
we can take the Penrose limit along it in the 
following way.
The coordinates of the geodesic are parametrized by
 
where  and  are the solutions
of  ().
 stands for   etc.

We introduce the light-cone coordinates
 
and rewrite the metric () of the
brane solution as
 
The Penrose limit is given by the following combination of
the coordinate transformation and the rescaling of the metric,
 
in the limit .
Here  is a shifted radial coordinate 
.

The divergent terms in () cancel due to
(). 
The parts which remain finite
take the plane wave form. After rescaling the coordinates
by suitable constants, we obtain(
In this paper we have changed the sign
of the definition of  in ()
from the one in the previous paper .) 
 
The coefficients  are constant and are given by
 
where , and 
 is defined in ().
The coordinates  () are
defined by
 

As we will see in section 5,  are the mass-squared 
(times a positive constant) for the bosonic modes  
of the string in the light-cone gauge on this background.
Note that the sign of  is always positive,
but the sign of  is given by 
the sign of . 
In the present work, we will study string theory on 
the plane wave where
 are all non-negative. When some of the
 become negative, there will be an instability 
on the world-sheet. Note that this does not necessarily
mean an instability of the spacetime ().  
In fact, the analyses of the linearized fluctuations
around some plane waves with negative  suggests
that the spacetime is stable.
This instability on the world-sheet suggests that the ground state
of the string is not point-like, but is rather a stretched 
configuration, due to the tidal force, as mentioned
in ref. .
Semi-classical analysis of strings around expanded 
configurations were performed in refs.  
for the  background.
Study of string theories on various brane backgrounds
along this line would be interesting, but it is 
beyond the scope of the present paper. 

In Appendix, we apply the general discussion 
in this section to various brane backgrounds.
We examine the conditions for the fixed radius null
geodesics for the D-brane,  fivebrane,
 string solutions. We will find several 
examples of the null geodesics with fixed radius. 
We will also see that the resulting string theories
have non-negative mass-squared only for 
the near-horizon limits of the fivebrane solutions.


Penrose limit of enhanc on geometry 
We now study the Penrose limit of enhanc on
geometry. 
In the first subsection, we will discuss 
possible null geodesics 
in the enhanc on geometries associated with D-branes.
In particular, we look for the null geodesics which 
stay at constant radius, by
using the formulas in the previous section.
We will show that such geodesics exist for the  case. 
In the second subsection, we will obtain the Penrose
limit of the  enhanc on geometry
along the geodesic.

Possible types of the null geodesics 

We consider null geodesics 
in the  space in the enhanc on geometry, 
where  is the radial coordinate
and   is one of the angular coordinates on the
 in the transverse space. We assume that
the geodesic is fixed in the  or in the 
directions  along the -brane.
We may use the formulas in the last section by setting
,  and 
.
For our background, it is convenient to define 
 
The condition () for the allowed region
of a geodesic is equivalent to .
Moreover, the condition for the fixed radius 
 is equivalent to ,
and the sign of  evaluated at the fixed radius
is the same as the sign of
.



Firstly we examine what kind of null geodesics are possible for
the cases of  and . We can see from (),
that we have  for sufficiently large ,
and that  has one solution . 
If the parameter  is chosen such that 
 is in the physically sensible region 
(),  is a turning point 
where a geodesic which comes from  
turns outward. On the other hand, if 
, the geodesic from the infinity
reaches the enhanc on radius, and it would pass
through the flat region () and then goes back to 
infinity.






We can easily see that 
do not have a solution, and there is not a geodesic 
which stay at constant radius for .

For the  case, on the other hand,



null geodesics with fixed radius 
is possible. The conditions for the fixed radius 
for  become
 
By eliminating  from () and (),
we obtain the equation which determines the fixed radius





which have two solutions
 
Here we have set , and used 
the relation .
The formal solutions in ()
are both positive  when 
 and , 
which is equivalent to
 
The two positive solutions 
in this case
are both in the physical region, i.e.  outside
the enhanc on radius . In fact, 
the difference  is given by





When () holds, 
the r.h.s. is positive since




Thus,  and  are greater than .
If () is not satisfied, 
() and () do not have positive
solution for any .

 




















If the  volume  is large enough to 
satisfy (), we may consider the null geodesic 
which is fixed at  or at . 
The parameter  is fixed to  or to , 
correspondingly, by the condition : 
 
Evaluating  with , ,
we obtain




That is, we have  at , 
but  at . 

We may analyze the null geodesics in 
the enhanc on geometries in the 
decoupling limit ()
by replacing the function  in 
() with
 
For , the condition for 
the constant radius  has one
solution:
 
When evaluated with this solution, we have  
.
This radius  is greater than the enhanc on
radius . 
Note that this  corresponds to  
in the full geometry. Indeed, we may obtain ()
by taking the  limit for  in
(). 
The larger solution  is 
scaled out in the decoupling limit.
For the , we do not have a solution of 
 with  in ().

Penrose limit of the  enhanc on along the 
null geodesic with constant radius 

We take the Penrose limit along the null geodesic 
with constant radius which we have found for 
the  enhanc on. We can readily obtain the
plane wave using the formula in section 3.

From () and (),
we get













 
where 





coordinates  
 are the ones along the .
In our case where the geodesic is fixed in the ,
the -part of the metric becomes flat. 
Note that we do not have  (spatial directions along
the -brane), since .
The constant coefficients  and  are 
given by
 
where ,  mean 
, ,
and .
We denote  the solutions of ,
which are given in () and ()
or in (), 
by  and . 

If the Penrose limit is taken along  or 
,  is positive, but
if the limit is taken along ,  is negative,
as we see from the signs of .



We will study string theory in the former cases, for the 
reason mentioned at the end of section 3. 
Substituting ,  into
(), we obtain the explicit forms
of  as follows: 
 
where 



and  is given in (). 
The plane wave for the geometry in the decoupling limit,
obtained by substituting , 
 in (),
is given by
 
where  is in ().
Note that () can be obtained
from () 
by taking the  limit.

The RR fields in the Penrose limit are obtained 
by applying the coordinate transformations and the rescalings of
the coordinates mentioned in section 3.2, to
(), ():
 


Here, we have used the relation





which follows from the fact that
the -part of the metric becomes flat in the
Penrose limit.
In the following, we will use the field strength ,
dual to : 
 

The explicit forms of the RR-field strengths (times
a dilaton factor) for  are given by
 
For , we have
 

Superstring spectrum on the plane wave  

Having obtained the Penrose limit of the
 enhanc on, we now study superstring theory
on the plane wave background. 
Our convention for the fermionic
part of the action follows that of 
Cvetic  et.al.  .
The covariant action of type IIA superstring 
up to the quadratic
order in fermions(It has been shown 
that the superstring action in the light-cone gauge is 
quadratic in fermions for fairly general
pp-wave backgrounds .) 
is given by 
 
Indices ,  denote the world-sheet directions
 and .  is the world-sheet
metric and . 
Spacetime indices are ,
and the indices for the transverse directions
are .
We will use  for the tangent frame.
Fermion  is the 32-component Majorana spinor,
 and  are the background metric
and the NS-NS 2-form, respectively.  The
-matrices  in 10 dimensions satisfy
. 
Chirality matrix  is given by 
.
Also note 
 and .
The conjugate spinor  is defined by
. 
Curved-space -matrices
 are given by applying 
the vielbein on .

The derivative  is 
the 'pull-back of the supercovariant derivative'
defined by

Here,  is the NS-NS 3-form field strength,
 and  are the RR 2-form
and 4-form field strengths, respectively, and  is
the dilaton background. The antisymmetrized product of 
-matrices  is
defined with weight 1.


On the pp-wave background, the only non-vanishing
contribution from the spin connection is

.



Since the NS-NS flux is absent and 
the non-vanishing components of the RR fluxes are
 and  in our case, 
 is written as

We substitute the plane wave background ()
for the  enhanc on into the action, and
impose the light-cone gauge condition
 
The equations of motion for the transverse bosonic fields 
become
 
where .
 are obtained in section 4.2.
There are four massless fields (),
three massive fields with mass  and 
one massive field with mass .



The fermionic part of the Lagrangian in the 
light-cone gauge reads
 
We now decompose  into  blocks
following ref. :






where  are the SO(8) -matrices which
satisfy , and
.
In this representation, spinors which satisfy 
 are of the form




We further decompose  into a pair of
8 component spinors 
according to their SO(8) chiralities:
 
We can write ()  in the form 
 
where 








The equations of motion become
 
Bringing these equations into diagonalized 
second-order forms, we find that the masses
of the fermionic modes are given by
the eigenvalues of 
. 
Evaluating it with the plane wave fluxes 
() for the fixed radius ,
we obtain
 
Here, indices  denote the -directions,
and  denotes the -direction. 
Signs  in () 
denote the eigenvalues of .



In the decoupling limit, where the fluxes are given
by (), this reduces to
 






For the world-sheet fermions, we have four fields 
of the same mass  given by the plus signs of 
() or (),
and four fields of the same mass  given by 
the minus signs of () or ().

The frequency of the  oscillator at the -th level
is given by 
, where 
 is either the mass for the bosonic modes
 or for the fermionic modes ,
. We note here that the sum of 
for the bosonic oscillators is equal to that for 
the fermionic oscillators, at each . 
Indeed, the following equality
(relation for the sum of 's) holds




as we see from () and (), 
or from () and ().
This property, which was also observed
for the plane waves for the Maldacena-Nu n ez
and the Klebanov-Strassler solutions 
in ref. , guarantees that 
the string theory is finite.

Mode expansion can be performed in the standard way.
(See e.g.  refs. .)
We obtain the light-cone Hamiltonian as follows:
 
Here   is the center of mass
momentum in the -directions. 
 (; )
and  (;   )
are the annihilation operators for 
the bosonic harmonic oscillators. 
,   
are the fermionic harmonic oscillators, where
we have written the spinor indices
 explicitly. 
These oscillators obey the standard commutation relations:

.
There should also be a vacuum energy 
in (). 
A physical state  
is subject to the level matching
condition:















Comment on the dual gauge theory 

The gauge theory which is dual to the string theory
on the decoupling limit of the  enhanc on
geometry is the 5-dimensional super Yang-Mills theory
compactified on  with the volume .
Firstly, we recall that the gauge coupling of the
5D theory and that of the -compactified 1D
theory are given by
 
respectively.
For the energy scale larger than the inverse radius
of  (), the 5D gauge theory provides
a good description, and for the small energy scale 
, the 1D gauge theory will take over.
The effective coupling at energy scale 
for the gauge theory in the large  limit
will be given by the following dimensionless 
't Hooft couplings :
 

Let us examine what is the parameter region of the
gauge theory to which our string-theory results
correspond. The string theory on the supergravity
background gives a good description when the
effective string coupling (determined by the dilaton v.e.v.)
and the curvature of the background measured in the
string unit are both small. Let us examine these 
conditions at the constant radius(
It may be more appropriate to require that the 
above two conditions are satisfied throughout the
'near-shell' region ,
as assumed in the case of the holography for 
the D0-branes. 
If we take this viewpoint, the condition for the smallness 
of the dilaton is replaced by .) 
.
We have 
 
where 
.
Thus, we need to set 
 fixed but large, and 
take the  limit, in order to have
the string coupling and the curvature both small.




Note that 

is the effective coupling ()
at the energy scale . 
The effective coupling grows as we increase
the energy above , and also grows as we
decrease the energy below .
Thus, the condition  implies that
the gauge theory to which our string results
should correspond is strongly coupled
at every energy region(
In ref. , identification of weakly 
coupled descriptions at various energy scales was
attempted. It was assumed that , 
which is opposite to our requirement here.) .

We note a qualitative behavior of the string spectrum
as we vary the volume  of the . 
The world-sheet mass is written as
 
From this, we see that in the 5D limit (when ), 
we have ,
and in the 1D limit (when ), .
This suggests that in the 5D limit, the energy  
of the low lying states are degenerate, since


.
On the other hand, in the 1D limit,  becomes
small, and the spectrum approaches that of 
the string in the flat space.

Conclusions 

In this paper, we have studied the Penrose limit along the null
geodesics with fixed radius both in general brane background and 
in enhanc on geometry.
In general background we have obtained the explicit formula for the plane
wave metric and discussed 
the condition that resulting string theories 
have tachyonic mass.
In enhanc on geometry associated with  () branes wrapped
on the  surface, we examined possible types of null geodesics with
fixed radius and obtained solvable superstring theories 
from the Penrose
limit of the  enhanc on geometry.
This geometry is dual to the five dimensional super Yang-Mills theory 
wrapped on  with eight supercharges.

We leave for future study the identification of 
the gauge-theory operators which correspond to 
the string states at the fixed radius.
For this purpose, it would  be important to 
study superstring theory on the Penrose limit 
along generic null geodesic, which has time-dependent masses, 
and regard the present  result as a special limit. 
This would be also interesting in view of holographic RG flow.
It may be the case that the holographic RG of 
our enhanc on geometry has some similarity with 
that for the Pilch-Warner solution corresponding
to the flow from  to  supersymmetric 
Yang-Mills theory. The massless field content of the above 
 theory is the one for the pure  
super Yang-Mills theory,
which is the same as the dual theory for the enhanc on 
geometry given by the D7-brane wrapped on .
In refs. , it was shown that the 
enhanc on mechanism also takes place for 
this  Pilch-Warner background.

In ref. , a formulation of the holographic
correspondence based on the string theory along 
the 'tunneling null geodesic' was proposed.
We note that the null geodesic with
constant radius found in this paper 
can be regarded as a limit of
a family of the tunneling null geodesics. 
Study of the enhanc on geometry from this standpoint
would be interesting.

Recently, the authors of ref.  proposed an
interpretation of the string spectrum
at fixed radius on the Maldacena-Nu n ez 
and the Klebanov-Strassler solutions. 
It is argued that the string states correspond to 
stable hadrons which are described by composite operators
made from massive fields. 
It is an interesting question whether 
a similar interpretation can be applied to our case.

Appendix: Null geodesics with constant
radius for various brane solutions 

As an application of the general procedure described 
in section 3, we analyze the D-brane,  fivebrane
 string solutions, which have been studied
in the previous paper .
We examine the conditions for the 
existence of the null geodesic with fixed radius
for each brane solution. When such a geodesic
exist, we take the Penrose limit. We note here
again that we have changed the sign in the definition
of the  from ref. .


We investigate the D-branes in appendix A.1, 
the  fivebranes including the NS5-branes
in appendix A.2, the  strings including 
the fundamental strings in appendix A.3.
We will see that  a stable geodesic for which
all  are non-negative,
is possible only for the fivebrane solutions
in the near-horizon limit. 


D-branes 
The D-brane solution in the string frame is given by
 
We can apply the formulas of section 3 by 
substituting , ,
and . We study the D-branes with .
To study the behavior of the null geodesics on this
background, it is convenient to define  
which is related to  in () by
 
The conditions  
for the null geodesic with
fixed radius are equivalent to
 
Note that the sign of  
is the same as that of .

In the near-horizon limit, the metric is
given by replacing  in () with 
 
In this case, the conditions for

We shall examine whether there are solutions to
() and (),
or () and ()
for each brane background.


For the D-branes with , we have the solution

Penrose limit along the null geodesic 
fixed at the radius  is obtained from 
the formula in section 3.
We get the plane wave metric () 
with
 
Since we have , string theory has
tachyonic mass on this plane wave.

In the near-horizon limit, there is no solution to
() and (). Indeed,
this is clear from the fact that the fixed
radius  is of the same order as the boundary
of the near-horizon region .

For , () and
() is satisfied by
 and . Taking the 
Penrose limit along this geodesic, we get
,  which are divergent.
On the other hand, when we consider the near-horizon 
geometry, () and () 
are satisfied by an arbitrary  if  
 is satisfied.
The Penrose limit is given by
 
In this case, we have , and there
is no tachyonic mass on the world-sheet of the 
string on this background.
The Penrose limit of fivebrane solutions along the
null geodesic with constant radius was obtained
by Oz and Sakai. 

For , the conditions for the constant radius
() and (), or 
() and () do not
have solutions.


 fivebranes 
The  fivebrane metric in the string frame is
 
where . 
This includes the NS5-branes ()
and the D5-branes () discussed above.
The conditions for the fixed radius  
are equivalent to , where
 
The conditions are of the similar form
as for the D5-branes, i.e. the  case of ().
() can be satisfied by 
 and , but
,  are divergent.

The  fivebrane metric in the near-horizon
limit is given by
replacing  in () with
 
The conditions for the constant radius is satisfied
by arbitrary , if we have .
In the Penrose limit, we have
 
which is consistent with the result
given in ref. . 
As in the case of the D5-branes, we have
 which is non-negative,
for the  fivebranes in the near-horizon limit.


 strings 
The  string metric in the string frame 
is given by
 
where . 
We obtain the fundamental strings by setting
, and the D1-branes discussed above
by setting . 
The conditions  are equivalent 
to , where 
 
Since () is of the same form as 
the  case of (), the conditions for
the constant radius are the same the ones for the D1-branes:
 
Taking the Penrose limit, we obtain
 
We have negative mass-squared .

The near-horizon limit of the
 string metric is given by
replacing  in () with
 
In this case, there is no null geodesic with
constant radius.
