The spontaneous symmetry breaking in noncommutative  theory has been analyzed by using the formalism
of the effective action for composite operators in the Hartree-Fock approximation. It turns out that there is no phase transition
to a constant vacuum expectation of the field and the broken phase corresponds to a nonuniform background. 
By considering  the generated mass gap depends on the angles among the momenta 
 and  and the noncommutativity parameter . The order of the transition is not easily determinable
in our approximation.

 INTRODUCTION 




The  effects of  noncommuting  coordinates have recently received new attention in relation  with string theoriesand there is a  great effort in understanding the fundamental properties of noncommutative field theories.
In particular, the phase structure of    theory has been recently discussed 
(see also and for numerical studies of the theory in three and two Euclidean dimensions)
and  Gubser and Sondhi showed that  there are indications for  a first order phase 
transition to a nonuniform ground state due to noncommutativity. 
In this paper  we essentially address the problem of spontaneous symmetry breaking  within the formalism
of the Effective Action for composite operators introduced by Cornwall, Jackiw and Tomboulis (CJT), 
in the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation. In this approach  we have coupled  
extremum equations, for the field and the full propagator, which shed new light on the transition from the ordered to  the disordered  phase.
We work in the cutoff field theory mainly for two reasons. First of all it is  
 not yet  clear whether the noncommutative theory
is renormalizable and
moreover the renormalization of the Effective Potential
in the HF approximation is cumbersome also for the commutative case .
Nevertheless the proposed approach gives interesting indications on the phase of the theory.
In particular we find in the HF approximation  that:

a) The transition from  to  turns out     
first order also for the commutative theory.

b) For the noncommutative theory, the minimization of the Effective Action has 
no solution for   and the broken phase   corresponds to a  nonuniform background field.

c) in the nonuniform stripe phase, with , the generated  mass gap
depends on  the value of  
where  is the momentum,  and
 
are  the coordinate commutators.

The  paper is organized as follows. In Section II we briefly review the CJT formalism and apply it in the HF approximation to the 
commutative  theory; Section  III is devoted to the noncommutative case with ;
 in Section IV we study the stripe phase and Section V contains the conclusions.
 
 COMMUTATIVE  THEORY   
 
 In this Section we shall briefly summarize the Effective Action 
for composite operator as introduced by Cornwall, Jackiw and Tomboulis (CJT) 
(see for details)  and study the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the commutative case.
The CJT Effective Action  is  given by
 
where  is the expectation value of the field on the ground state,  is the full
connected propagator of the theory,  is 
 the classical Effective Action:

 
 is the free propagator

 
and 

 
with the interaction terms   at least cubic in the fields.

The term   is computed as follows. In the classical action  shift 
the field  by .
The new action  possesses terms cubic and higher 
in  which define an "interaction" part  where
the vertices depend on .
 is given by  all two particle irreducible vacuum graphs 
in the theory with vertices determined by  
 and propagator set equal to .
The usual Effective Action is recovered by extremizing with respect to .
We evaluate   for  the commutative   theory with action

 
in the Hartree-Fock approximation which corresponds to retain only the 
lowest order contribution in coupling constant to  (see)).
The coupled equations for the extrema of   are

 

It turns out that in this approximation the propagator can be conveniently  
parametrized as 
 

and the two previous equations become

 

 

The extrema of the Effective Action are for  and   constant. 
The previous equations contain divergences that are regularized by introducing a  cutoff .
By requiring that  physical quantities are exponentially decoupled from the cuf-off we redefine the parameter  
to cancel the quadratic divergences,
i.e. 

 
and  the coupled equations (in the  Euclidean space) become

 

 
where all the dimensional quantities have been rescaled in units of the cutoff .
The extremum equations have two sets of solutions:

 

 
and 

 

 

Now let us consider the second set of solutions  
which is the relevant one for the spontaneous symmetry breaking,
and solve it for various values of .

a)  =0 

In this case, beside the solution ,  obtained form Eqs. (,), one finds 
two nonvanishing opposite  solutions for  :

 
with 

 

b)   


To solve Eq. () one rescales all quantities  in unit of  , the solution for 
 =0, thus obtaining 

 
where  and  .
It is easy to verify that for  there is no solution of 
Eq. () 
and the only solution of Eqs. (-) is  with a nonvanishing  mass
 obtained from Eq. ().
In the region   
there are two  solutions of 
Eq. () ,  and  ,
and then  five extrema corresponding to  and to

 
Note that for  
the two solutions for  coincide: .
and correspondingly there are three different extrema in  . 
For  there is only one solution in  
which corresponds to two nonvanishing extrema in .

Let us finally translate the previous informations on the shape of the  Effective Potential
as a function of  for different values of . 
For  there is only the extremum at  and 
the potential corresponds to plot (a) in Figure 1.
For  two new nonvanishing extrema  appear and 
for    there are five extrema and the shape is 
as in plot (b). Note that when lowering 
, the maxima of the potential for  decrease and the corresponding 
values of  become smaller and approach zero and also  the minima decrease but 
the corresponding values of   increase.  
For  =0 the solution corresponding to the maxima have 
merged into  and there are three extrema (see plot (d)).
Then for some critical, finite and positive value of  the  potential 
must be of the form reported in plot (c),
with three degenerate minima at different values of .
This picture implies a (weak) first order phase transition and suggest that in this case 
the HF approximation  gives  a "coarse grain" description reliable to establish the 
occurrence of the transition but probably not its order. 


  NONCOMMUTATIVE   THEORY 

In this Section we shall analyze the extremum equations for the CJT  Effective Action 
for the noncommutative theory defined by the action
 
 
 where the star product is defined by ()

&&^4* (x)= (x) * (x) * (x) * (x) = 



&& i 2  _i<j _  ^ _x_i  ^ _x_j ( (x_1) (x_2) (x_3) (x_4)) _x_i =x  .
The theory has been discussed in the literature (see e.g. the review) and  
the planar approximation,  has the same behavior of the commutative theory: 
a phase transition for  and a translational invariant full propagator 
parametrized as in Eq.() with constant  .

Let us now check whether this behavior survives to the genuine noncommutative effects, i.e. for finite 
. With a translational invariant propagator
G(x,y)=d^4 p (2)^4  e^-ip(x-y)  G(p)  
the CJT Effective Action in momentum space reads

 &&(, G) = 1 2   d^4 p (2 )^4   (p^2 - m^2) (p) (-p)


&& - 4!   [ _a=1 ^4   d^4 p_a (2 )^4   (p_a) 
] ^4 
(_ap_a ) (i 2  p_1 p_2)
(i 2  p_3 p_4) 
 
&& + i 2  ^4 (0)  d^4 p (2 )^4  D(p)G^-1 (p) + 
 1 2  ^4 (0)  d^4 p (2 )^4  (p^2 - m^2) G(p) 

&& -   6   d^4 p (2 )^4  
 d^4 q (2 )^4 
 (p) (-p) G(q) [1 + 1 2  (i  q p) ] 

  
&& -    12   ^4 (0) 
 d^4 p (2 )^4   d^4 q (2 )^4  G(p)G(q)
 [1 + 1 2   (i  q p) ] 

where .
In the noncommutative case let us parametrize 

G(q)=i q^2-M^2(q) 
where  is a function of the four-momentum.

From Eq. () we get two coupled extemum equations for  and 
^4 (0) &&M^2(q) -  m^2 - 3  d^4 p (2)^4 
    i   (p^2 - M^2(p))   (1 + 12   (i  q p) ) 

&&=
3  d^4 p (2)^4 (p)(-p) (1 + 12   (i  q p) )
&&q^2 -  m^2 - 3  d^4 p (2)^4 
    i   (p^2 - M^2(p))   (1 + 12   (i  q p) ) (-q) 

&&=12  d^4 p (2)^4 d^4 k (2)^4 
(p)(k-p)(-q-k)  (i 2   p k)  

&&( (i 2   k q)+ (-i 2   k q)
 )
With the help of Eq. (), one can get rid of the constant  in Eq. () which  becomes

&&q^2 - M^2(q)  (-q)
 +(^4 (0))^-1  (-q)  3  d^4 p (2)^4 
(p)(-p) (1 + 12   (i  q p) )

&&=12  d^4 p (2)^4 d^4 k (2)^4 
(p)(k-p)(-q-k)  (i 2   p k) 

&& ( (i 2   k q)+ (-i 2   k q)
 )
Then, analogously to what has been done for the commutative case 
in Eq. (), we cancel the quadratic divergence in Eq. () by defining 
 
and we can directly check whether a constant background
 
is a solution of the extremum equations. Indeed, by replacing Eqs. () and ()  in 
 Eqs. () and () we get 
 

 

We note that in Eq.  () we can replace  with  because of the delta function .
As usual there is the solution    and  given by Eq. () (where the term proportional 
to the field  has been discarded).  

This case has been studied in with the interesting result that for   the function  has a 
singular behavior
( constant)

 
which  is  a genuine effect of  the noncommutative structure of the theory and does  not change if one considers the same equation
for  because it is due to the phase factor in the integral in Eq. ().

Let us consider the equations () and  ()
in the case of constant finite and nonvanishing background . 
As noticed above, due to the noncommutative terms,   constant is not a solution 
of Eq.():
 must depend on  and moreover  for small  is singular as in Eq. ().
Then the condition   from Eq. () does not admit a 
finite constant solution .
Therefore a finite  constant solution   is ruled out by the analysis of the combined 
equations.

It is interesting to note  that an indication of the impossibility of finding a constant field solution of our extremum
equations could have been obtained directly from Eqs. () and  (). In fact after  replacing in these 
equations the constant field solution Eq. (), the quadratic divergences that
appear in  the two extremum equations cannot be simultaneously cancelled by a single counterterm, 
namely  as fixed in Eq. (), and therefore all solutions of the coupled equations
are plagued with a quadratically divergent integral. 

In our previous analysis the problem of cancelling the quadratic divergences 
has been hidden by the replacement performed to get Eq.  ()
which apparently made the case of constant background field free of divergences
although in the end  we could not find any suitable solution because of
the singular behavior of   at  shown in Eq. ().
By looking at  Eq. (), it is easy to realize that this  dependent singular behavior 
is directly related to the not complete cancellation of the quadratic divergences for 
finite . Indeed this pathology is not present in the planar limit. 

In conclusion, we have to reject the constant solution  
and look for  spontaneous symmetry breaking  
only  in  a nonuniform phase.

   THE STRIPE PHASE   

As pointed out in the phase transition to a nonuniform state is related to a periodic correlation function 
 which oscillates
 in sign for large . For this reason we consider 
a time independent stripe pattern 
 
and calculate the CJT Effective Action in the Hartree-Fock approximation in the static limit.
Let us then assume that  has no time component  and  .

It is impossible to study the transition to the stripe phase with the most general
class of propagators  and we shall limit ourselves to a Raileigh-Ritz variational approach where, however
a meaningful  ansatz for  requires at least some physical indications on  its  asymptotic behaviors.
Indeed the nonuniform background given in Eq. () has a new typical scale . 
For small  (in cutoff units), the effect of the nonuniform
background will be relevant only for large distances and the background will be a slowly varying function of .

Then for momenta , the breaking of the translational and rotational invariance is expected negligible 
and a good ansatz for the tridimensional propagator in momentum space is

G(p)=1 2 p^2+ M^2_o  
where, analogously to the constant background case,  is a constant.

In the region , the previous ansatz is of course not reliable and to obtain 
further informations on the behavior of  let us preliminarily assume that  the breaking of the
translational invariance appears in the field expectation value only, i.e. in Eq. (), 
while we consider a general translational invariant form of the propagator with  
 
G(p)=1 2 p^2+ M^2(p)  
Then we analyze the extremum equations obtained by minimizing, with respect to  and , the quantity 
defined as
 
- (0) E(,G)=(,G)
with  computed in the static limit.
The three coupled equation for  and  respectively turn out
   
&&M^2(p) = m^2
+ A^2 6 (1 + 1 2  (  p  Q) )


&&+ 3  d^3 k (2)^3  1 2k^2+M^2(k)  
(1 + 1 2  (  p  k) )
 

 
 
The cancellation of the quadratic divergences is now obtained by defining 

 

Let us first discuss Eq. () and look for a small  solution.
Due to the strong oscillating factor, for small  the integration region is dominated by large 
and then we can replace  with its asymptotic behavior in Eq. () or, in other words, 
.

By choosing the configuration  and , 
the small   selfconsistent solution turns out 

qqad 
Q^2 ^2 =( 24 ^2   )^1/2  1 ^2 
where we consider from now on large but finite values of .

The next step is to consider the gap equation ().
As previously discussed for large  one expects .
For   the selfconsistent behavior of  is

masy 
M^2(p). _p0  + A^2   12  1 + 12 (p ( Q  )
) +   6^2   1 p  ^2 
where  is a constant and   indicates the usual vector product. 
The last term corresponds to the small  contribution analogous to the 
singular behavior in Eq. ().

Finally one can qualitatively analyze the phase transition by looking at the equation for , Eq.  (),
that  can be written in the form 
&&A^2=-8   Q^2 +^2      

&& + 3  d^3 k (2)^3    1 2k^2 +M^2(k)  
(1- k^2 +M^2(k)   k  +12  (k ( Q  ))) Indeed, if the contribution of the integrals in Eq. () is negligible, a solution  for 
is allowed only for sufficiently negative . 
Moreover in this approximation the energy gap between the stripe phase and the  phase is about 
, showing that the broken phase is energetically favored.

On the basis of this preliminary analysis, to establish the occurrence of the spontaneous symmetry breaking
one can apply the following settings of selfconsistent approximations for the numerical 
evaluation of the energy defined in Eq. ():

1) slowly changing background, i.e.
Q^2 ^2 =(24 ^2  )^1/2  1 ^2 <<1 
with small  and large, finite ;

2)  translational invariant with  as in  Eq. () with  given by 
mdef1 
M^2(p)= M^2_o 
+ A^2   12  1 + 12 (p ( Q  )
) +   6^2   1 p  ^2 
                 for  p^2Q^2

mdef2 
M^2(p)= M^2_o                                                                     for  p^2Q^2
This choice is motivated by  the selfconsistent asymptotic solution of Eq. () (which is displayed in Eq. ())  and, above all, by
the previous observation that  the transition is mainly driven by  and depends weakly on the 
other details of our ansatz for  in the small  region.
 
By means of  Eqs. () and (,,), we computed, in cutoff units, 
E(A,M_o^2,)=E(A,M_o^2,)-E(0,0,0)
for  and  fixed and studied the occurrence of the phase transition by changing the mass parameter .

For  there is no spontaneous symmetry breaking. Figure 2 shows  for ,  
and , for different values of  in the range between  and .

For  values of  below a negative threshold, we observe spontaneous symmetry breaking. In Figure 3 different plots of   
are reported for  and again   in the range between  and .  and 
are the same as in the previous case and the absolute minimum is for .

To follow the behavior of  as a function of , in Figure 4 we give  for fixed  and different 
values of . The absolute minimum goes slowly to zero around . 
The qualitative picture does not strongly depend on the particular values taken for  and  as long as we stay in the 
low  region where the whole approach is selfconsistent.


   CONCLUSIONS   

The variational Raileigh-Ritz approximation to the CJT Effective Action  shows that for large  i.e. small 
the transition to a broken stripe phase occurs. The mass generated by the gap equation depends on the mutual direction among ,
 and the momentum vector . This phenomenon occurs also in noncommutative electrodynamicswhere for the electromagnetic waves the modified dispersion relation 

 c =k ( 1-b_T _T )
depends on the angles among the wave vector  and the transverse components ( with respect to ) of the background magnetic
field    and of the vector .

In our approximated numerical analysis we checked that the occurrence of spontaneous symmetry breaking is weakly related 
to the ansatz made on  in the small  region. The transition essentially depends on  and this is the 
a posteriori  main motivation to believe that also a translational invariant approximation for the propagator can reproduce
the qualitative features of the transition  also of  the noncommutative  theory.
On the other hand, due to our coarse grained ansatz on the propagator,  
 we are not able to make a precise statement on the order of the phase transition which, in turn,  depends 
on the dynamical details of the theory. 

Finally we considered a simplest periodic structure for the background field in Eq. () because no qualitative changes
 are expected for more
complicated superpositions as suggested in.
