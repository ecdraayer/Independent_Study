We elaborate on the duality-symmetric nonlinear electrodynamics
in a new formulation with auxiliary tensor fields. The Maxwell field 
strength appears only in bilinear terms of the corresponding generic 
Lagrangian, while the self-interaction is presented by a function  
depending on the auxiliary fields. Two types of dualities  inherent in the
nonlinear electrodynamics models admit a simple off-shell characterization 
in terms of this function. In the standard formulation, the continuous 
 duality symmetry is nonlinearly realized on the Maxwell field 
strength. In the new setting, the same symmetry acts as linear  
transformations of the auxiliary field variables. The nonlinear   
duality condition proves to be equivalent to the linear  invariance
of the self-interaction . The discrete self-duality (or self-duality 
by Legendre transformation) amounts to a weaker reflection symmetry of .
For a class of duality-symmetric Lagrangians we introduce an alternative
representation with the auxiliary scalar field and find new explicit
examples of such systems.



It is well known that the on-shell  () duality symmetry (or
self-duality) of Maxwell equations can be generalized to the whole class of
the nonlinear electrodynamics models, including the famous Born-Infeld
theory. The condition of   duality can be formulated as a nonlinear
differential constraint on the  Lagrangians of these models.
Using a non-analytic change of  basic field variables of the Lagrangian
the  duality condition can be transformed to the well-known
Courant-Hilbert equation. Recently, it has been observed 
that the requirement of analyticity of the initial Lagrangian implies an 
additional algebraic constraint which selects the proper subclass of 
solutions of this Courant-Hilbert equation.

In this paper we elaborate on another approach to the 
duality-symmetric Lagrangians, in which the manifest analyticity is 
guaranteed at each step.(A preliminary version of this approach 
was presented in.)  It makes use of the auxiliary tensor 
fields. The starting point is the generic nonlinear electrodynamics 
Lagrangian
L(F^2,F^2) = -12 (F^2 + F^2) + L^int (F^2, F^2),
1 
where ,
 and 
 are the mutually conjugated 
 and  components of the Maxwell field strength in the 
two-component spinor notation. Its new representation involves, apart from 
the Maxwell field strength, also unconstrained auxiliary symmetric bispinor 
(tensor) fields  and their 
squares  and 
(F,V) = 12 (F^2 + F^2) +(+)- 2 (VF + 
VF) + E(, ),2 
where  codifies the entire self-interaction. The generic 
Lagrangian 1  is recovered as a result of eliminating the auxiliary 
fields in 2  by their algebraic equations of motion. The basic advantage 
of this novel representation for  duality-symmetric systems is 
related to its following remarkable feature. In contradistinction to 
nonlinear  duality transformations of , the 
transformations of the new auxiliary variables are linear . As a 
consequence, the  duality condition is linearized and can be 
explicitly solved in this new setting. The general Lagrangian solving
this constraint is specified by the interaction term  
 which includes only the -invariant scalar
combination of the auxiliary fields  as an 
argument. More general nonlinear electrodynamics Lagrangians respecting 
the so-called discrete self-duality (or duality by Legendre transformation) 
also admit a simple off-shell characterization in terms of the function 
. In this case it should be even, , 
and otherwise arbitrary.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sect.  we give a brief 
account of the continuous and "discrete" dualities in nonlinear 
electrodynamics in the conventional approach. A novel representation of 
the appropriate Lagrangians via bispinor auxiliary fields is discussed in 
Sect. . An explicit solution of the algebraic equations of motion 
relating the initial and auxiliary variables can be immediately found only 
for a restricted class of the interaction functions , e.g. 
for the text-book case of Born-Infeld theory (though their perturbative 
solution always exists). In order to construct new explicit examples of 
duality-symmetric models we introduce, in Sect. , an alternative 
representation for the important subclass of interactions 
, namely, those containing terms of the 4th order in the field 
strengths. This representation makes use of a different linearly
transforming auxiliary scalar variable  which is related to the 
variable  by a sort of Legendre transformation. The ansatz for 
the appropriate class of solutions of the  duality condition
contains an invariant analytic function , and the  expression
for the corresponding Lagrangians in the -representation is 
parametrized by this function. The algebraic equation for the auxiliary 
variable  can be explicitly solved in terms of the initial variables 
 for a wide class of the functions .
Explicit examples of duality-symmetric analytic Lagrangians, including 
the Born-Infeld Lagrangian and some new ones constructed here for the 
first time, are collected in Sect. .



We start by recapitulating the basic facts about nonlinear 4D 
electrodynamics models which reveal duality properties and include the 
free Maxwell theory and Born-Infeld theory as particular cases. Detailed 
motivations why such models are of interest to study can be found e.g. in 
.

Continuous on-shell  duality 
In the two-component spinor  notation, the Maxwell field strengths are
defined by
&&F_^(A)14 (^m)_(^n)^ F_mn =14 (_^A_+_^A_) ,defF 

&&F _^(A)F_^(A)  ,F_mn =
_m A_n-_nA_m ,where  are the Weyl matrices of the group 
,  and  
 is the corresponding vector gauge potential. Below we shall sometimes 
treat    as independent variables, without 
assuming them to be expressed through .

Let us introduce the Lorentz-invariant complex variables
 F^2 = F^F_ , = F^2  =
F ^ F _  .
compl 
Two independent real invariants which one can construct out of the Maxwell 
field strength in the standard vector notation take the following form in 
these complex variables:
F^mn F_mn =2( +) ,12 ^mnpq F_mn F_pq  
=-2i(vecsp 
It will be convenient to deal with dimensionless 
 and , introducing a coupling
constant , . Then the generic nonlinear Lagrangian
can be represented as



where
L(,) =
-12 (+)+L^int (,)
nonl 
and the real analytic  self-interaction  collects
all possible higher-order terms   . This
analyticity requirement rules out, for instance, terms with radicals
of the type  or .

We shall use the following notation for the derivatives of the Lagrangian
 (In these and some subsequent relations it is
assumed that the functional argument  stands for both  and
; we hope that this short-hand notation will not give 
rise to any confusion.) 
&&P_(F)iL/F^ L_ ,defP 

&&L_L/ ,L_L/ and for the bilinear combinations of them
P^2=P^P_= P^2=
P ^ P _ =-4(L_)^2 .Pvar 
In the vector notation, the same quantities read
P ^mn 12 ^mnpq P_pq =
2 L/F_mn , i2 P_mn P ^mn =  .The nonlinear equations of motion have the following form in the
spinor notation:
&& _^P_ (F)
-^_P_(F)= 0 .BIeq 
These equations, together with the Bianchi identities
&&
_^F_ -^_F_= 0 , Bian 
constitute a set of first-order equations in which one can treat 
and  as unconstrained  conjugated variables.

This set is said to be duality-symmetric if the Lagrangian 
satisfies certain nonlinear condition. The precise form
of this  duality condition is as follows
&&F^2+P^2-F^2-P^2i4 ^mnpq 
(F_mn  F_pq +P_mn  P_pq )


&&= + -- =- - 4[(L_)^2 - 
(L_)^2]=0.sdI 
To clarify the meaning of sdI , let us define the nonlinear 
transformations
&& _F_= 2iF_L_ ,
Ftrans 

&&_L_vptrans 
where  is a real parameter. Then eq. sdI  ensures that this 
transformation constitutes a nonlinear realization of the  group. 
Indeed, given sdI ,  and  form
an  vector
_P_(F)
=-F_  Ptrans1  .
The set of equations BIeq , Bian  and the  constraint sdI  
itself are clearly invariant under these transformations. Thus they are 
an obvious generalization of the  duality transformation in the 
Maxwell theory:
 _F_F_ , _F _ = iF _  ,
which is a symmetry of the vacuum Maxwell equation
.

Using sdI , the following important relations can be derived:
_L =i( ,L_i2 L_^2 .
delta1 
It should be pointed out that these transformations make sense only 
on the mass shell defined by eqs. BIeq , Bian .

The general solution of the  duality condition sdI  has been
considered earlier in Refs.. Using the nonanalytic
change of variables
p=14 (+)+12   ,q=14 (+)-
12  
one can cast equation sdI  in the form of the well-known
Courant-Hilbert equation
_p_q=1 .CHeq 
The general solution of this equation is parametrized by a real analytic
function ,
&&L (p,q)=v(s)+2p v^(s)  ,q=s+
p [v^(s)]^2 nasd 
and it is completely specified by an algebraic equation for the auxiliary
variable . The authors of Ref. have shown that the natural 
requirement of analyticity of the Lagrangian with respect to the initial 
variables  can be rephrased as the additional constraint on the 
function 
[(s)]=s .addit 
The perturbative analysis shows that the whole class of duality-symmetric
analytic solutions   exists. However,
the only solution explicitly worked out so far is the familiar
Born-Infeld example. Nonphysical solutions of eq.CHeq  contain 
nonanalytic terms   (see, e.g.).

In Sect. 3 and 4 we shall discuss two complementary approaches to solving 
the  duality equation which guarantee analyticity and covariance 
of solutions at each stage of calculations. Based on this, in Sect. 5 we 
shall present several new examples of duality-symmetric Lagrangians which 
meet the analyticity criterion.

It is worth pointing out once more that the  duality transformations 
in the standard setting described above cannot be realized on the vector
potential ; they provide a symmetry between the equations of motion
and Bianchi identity and as such define on-shell  symmetry. The
manifestly  duality-invariant off-shell Lagrangians can be 
constructed in the formalism with additional vector and auxiliary fields 
. We are planning to discuss a relation to this extended 
formalism elsewhere.

The Lagrangian  satisfying sdI  is not invariant with 
respect to transformation Ftrans . Yet one can construct, out of  
and , the  invariant function
I(,)L+i2 (FP-F P ) =
L-L_L_ ,invar 
where . However, 
starts with the 4-th order term , so this invariant cannot be
interpreted as a Lagrangian.

Finally, notice that, given some  obeying sdI ,
the following Lagrangian related to  by the simple rescaling
L^ds (,)  rL^ds (r^-1 ,r^-1 ) ,rescal 
with  being an arbitrary real number, also obeys sdI  and
so yields a duality-symmetric model. Clearly, rescaling the coupling 
constant as  and properly rescaling 
, one can always choose 
, so only the sign of  actually matters in rescal .
Thus
L^(-) (,)=-L^ds (-,-) mirr 
gives a non-equivalent duality-symmetric Lagrangian for each given 
. In Sect. we shall consider this transformation for the 
Lagrangian of the Born-Infeld theory.


Self-duality by Legendre transformation 
To explain what the "discrete duality" means we shall need a first-order 
representation of the action corresponding to the Lagrangian nonl . It 
is such that the Bianchi identities Bian  are implemented in the action 
with a Lagrange multiplier and so  are 
unconstrained complex variables off shell. This form of the action is 
given by
1f^2 d^4x L^(F,F^)=1f^2 
d^4x[L(,)+i(FF^F F ^)] ,1stor 
where
 F^_ 14 (_ ^A^_ 
+_ ^A^_ ) .PD 
Varying with respect to the Lagrange multiplier , one obtains 
just the Bianchi identities for  Bian . Solving 
them in terms of the gauge potential  and substituting 
the result into 1stor , we come back to nonl . On the other hand, 
the multiplier  is defined up to the standard Abelian gauge
transformation, which suggests interpreting  and
 as the dual  gauge potential and gauge field
strength, respectively. Using the algebraic equations of motion for the
variables , one can express the action 1stor 
in terms of . If the resulting
action has the same form as the original one in terms of 
, the corresponding model is said to enjoy the 
discrete duality. This sort of duality should not be confused with the 
on-shell continuous  duality discussed earlier. However, as we 
shall see soon, any  solving the constraint sdI  defines 
a system possessing the discrete duality. The inverse statement is not 
generally true, so the class of nonlinear electrodynamics actions
admitting  duality of equations of motion forms a subclass in the
variety of actions which are duality-symmetric in the "discrete" sense.

Let us elaborate on this in some detail. The dual picture is achieved by
varying 1stor  with respect to the independent variables 
, which yields the equation
F^_ =i L/F^P_(F) =
2iF_L_ ,
where  is the same as in defP . Substituting the solution of
this algebraic equation, , into 1stor  gives us
the dual Lagrangian 
L^(^, ^) L^[F(F^), F^] ,
hatL 
where  and 
 were defined in Pvar . Then the discrete self-duality 
defined above amounts to the condition
L^(^, ^) = L(^, ^) , 
discr1 
or, equivalently, to
L^(, ) = L(, ) . discr 
Using FDF  and its conjugate, as well as the definitions 1stor ,
hatL , one can explicitly check the property
 F_L^(^, ^)/
 F^  (and c.c. ) .
Due to this relation, and keeping in mind the inverse one FDF ,
one can treat the equation
L^(P^2, P^2)
=L(F^2,F^2)+i(FP-F P )
=L(,)-2L_L_stleg 
as setting the Legendre transforms  between 
two functions of complex variables. Thus the discrete duality discr1 , 
discr  can be equivalently called "self-duality by Legendre 
transformation".

On the level of equations of motion BIeq  and Bian , the discrete
self-duality discr  can be equivalently defined as their invariance with 
respect to the special finite  transformation 
&& F_F_P_P_=-F_.discrSO 
This invariance is manifested in the following on-shell transformation 
properties of the Lagrangian and its derivative
&&L(,)=L(,)+iPF-iPFL(,),Lambda 

&&L_14 L_^-1  .Let us show  that the  duality condition sdI  indeed guarantees
the discrete duality discr . The simplest proof of this statement (see 
e.g.) makes use of the special  transformation , 
eq. discrSO , and the invariance of function invar  under the global 
version of the general  transformations Ftrans 
I(,)L(,)-i2 FP+
i2 F P =I(,).discinvar 
Comparing this relation with stleg , we arrive at the condition
discr . Clearly, the -invariance of  is a weaker 
condition than its  invariance, so the Lagrangians revealing the 
property of  duality form a subclass of those which are self-dual 
in the discrete sense.



A new setting for Lagrangians of nonlinear electrodynamics 
The recently constructed  supersymmetric extension of the Born-Infeld
theory suggests a new representation for the actions of
nonlinear electrodynamics discussed in the previous Section.

The infinite-dimensional off-shell  vector multiplet contains gauge 
field strengths defF   and auxiliary fields  and
.

The gauge field part of the off-shell super  Maxwell component 
Lagrangian is (In the rest of the paper we put the overall 
coupling constant  equal to 1.) 
_2(V,F)=+ 2(VF+V F )
+12 (+) , auxfree 
where
&&V^2=V^V_ ,V^2=V ^ 
V _  ,

&& VFV^F_ ,V F 
V ^ F _ .
Eliminating  by its algebraic equation of motion,
 V^= F^ , V^  = F^  ,free1 
we arrive at the free Maxwell Lagrangian
 L_2(F) = - 12 (+ ) . maxw1 
Our aim will be to find a nonlinear extension of the free Lagrangian 
auxfree , such that this extension becomes the generic nonlinear 
Lagrangian , eq. nonl , upon eliminating the 
auxiliary fields  by
their algebraic (nonlinear ) equations of motion.

By Lorentz covariance, the off-shell -representation of the 
nonlinear Lagrangian nonl  has the following general form:
 [V,F(A)] = _2[V,F(A)] + E(,) , legact 
where  is a real analytic function of two variables which encodes
self-interaction. Varying the action with respect to , we derive 
the analytic relation between  and  in this formalism
 F_(A) = V_(1+ E_) (and c.c. ) , FV 
where . The corresponding
algebraic relations between the scalar functions are
FV=(1+E_) .algsc 
The relation FV   can be used to eliminate the auxiliary variable 
 in terms of  and , 
 (see eq. VF  below). The natural restrictions on the 
interaction function  are
&& E(0,0)=0 ,E_(0,0)= E_(0,0) = 0 .stcond 
They mean that the -expansion of  does not 
contain constant and linear terms. Clearly, given some analytic 
interaction Lagrangian  in nonl , one can pick up 
the appropriate function , such that the elimination of 
 by FV  yields just this self-interaction.
Thus legact  with an arbitrary (non-singular) interaction function 
is an alternative form of generic nonlinear electrodynamics Lagrangian 
nonl . The second equation of motion in this representation, obtained 
by varying legact  with respect to , has the form
 ^_[F_(A)-2V_]+c.c. =0 .FV3 
After substituting  from FV , eq. FV3  becomes
the dynamical equation for  corresponding
to the generic Lagrangian  nonl . Comparing FV3  with BIeq 
yields the important relation
 P_(F) = i[ F_- 2V_(F) ] , imprel 
where  was defined in defP .

Let us elaborate in more detail on how the -representation of the 
nonlinear electrodynamics Lagrangians is related to the original 
"minimal" one nonl . The general solution of the algebraic equation 
FV  for  can be written as
 V_(F)=F_G(,)VF  .
The relation of the transition functions  to 
follows from  eq. FV 
 G^-1 =1+E_ ,G ^-1 =1+E_ . GE 
Eq.VF  gives us the relations
&&G^2 ,G ^2nuvp  , 

&&V(F)F=G ,V (F)F=G  ,VF2 
which, taking into account GE , coincide with algsc .

The transition function  can be found from the basic
requirement that  legact  coincides with the initial nonlinear
action after eliminating :
&& [V(F),F]=L(,) .EL1 
Using eqs. imprel , VF2  and the definition defP , it is easy 
to obtain the simple expression for the transition function in terms of 
the Lagrangian nonl 
&& G(, )= 12 -L_ .
exprG 
A useful corollary of this formula and of eqs. nuvp , GE  is
 E_14 (1-4L^2_) . corol 
Given a fixed , one can express  (and then 
) in terms of  from eqs. nuvp , exprG  and restore 
the explicit form of  from legact , auxfree ,
E = L(, ) -12 (+)-G + G) , 
ELrel 
via the substitution 
. Conversely, given , one can restore ,
by expressing  through  from the first of eqs. algsc .
In practice, finding such explicit relations is a rather complicated task
(see Sect. ).


Duality symmetries as invariance of self-interaction 
So far we did not discuss dualities in the -representation. A link
with the consideration in the previous Section is established by eq.
imprel  which relates the functions  and .

Using this identification, the realization of the  duality 
transformations Ftrans , Ptrans1  on independent variables  
and  is easily found to be
&&_V_V_ ,Vtrans 

&&_F_=i [F_-2V_] .We see that, before effecting the algebraic equation FV  which 
expresses  in terms of  and 
,  duality symmetry is realized
linearly .

Next, substituting imprel  into the  duality condition sdI  
and making use of eq. corol , we find
14 (1-4L^2_)-14 (1-4L^2_)=E_E_newsd 
Thus passing to the -representation allows one to rewrite the
nonlinear differential equation sdI  as a linear  differential
equation for the function . It is important to emphasize that 
the new form newsd  of the constraint sdI  admits a transparent 
interpretation as the condition of invariance of  under the
 transformations Vtrans 
&& _E = 2i(E_- E_) = 0 .
The general solution of newsd  is an analytic function 
depending on the single real  invariant variable 
which is quartic in the  auxiliary fields  and :
&& E^ds (, ) = (a) = () ,
(0)=0 .
We come to the notable result that in the representation legact  the 
whole  class of nonlinear extensions of the Maxwell action
admitting the on-shell  duality is parametrized by an arbitrary 
 invariant real function of one argument .
A remarkable property of  is that its power expansion collects 
only terms , i.e. those of -th order in the fields. 
Below we shall present this expansion for a few examples, including the 
notorious case of Born-Infeld theory.

It is evident that the bilinear part of the duality-symmetric Lagrangian 
in the -representation auxfree  is not invariant
__2(F,V)=i(F^2+2V^2-2FV-c.c )=
i(Thus the continuous  duality in the -representation amounts 
to a "partial"  symmetry of the entire Lagrangian: it is a 
symmetry of its interaction part . It should be pointed 
out that the auxiliary field 
 is not subjected off shell to any constraint (as distinct from the 
Maxwell field strength which is subjected to the Bianchi identity), so the 
characterization of the  duality-symmetric systems in the 
-representation as those with the  invariant self-interaction 
is valid off shell .

Let us consider the general  invariant interaction .
In order to construct the corresponding  Lagrangian  one 
should solve the algebraic equations for  or 

F__a)  _a)^2 .FVsd 
Using eq. FVsd , one can derive the general equations relating the 
auxiliary variables  and   to the original variables 

&(1-a^2^4_a)=a_a^2+2a_a(a_a^2-1),& 

& (1+a_a^2)^2Note that it is not easy to find examples of the function  for 
which the algebraic equation for  becomes explicitly 
solvable. In the next Section we shall consider an alternative choice of 
the auxiliary scalar variables which simplifies the explicit construction 
of duality-symmetric Lagrangians.

Finally, let us examine which restrictions on the interaction Lagrangian
 are imposed by the requirement of the discrete
self-duality with respect to the exchange 
. We shall do it in two ways.

We shall need a first-order representation of the Lagrangian legact  
analogous to 1stor . Let us treat  in eq.legact  as a 
function of two independent complex  variables 
 and implement the Bianchi identities for 
 (amounting to the expressions defF ) in the 
Lagrangian via the dual field-strength  PD :
 [V,F,F^] (V,F) +i[F^F - 
F ^F ] . modB 
The algebraic equation of motion for , i.e. 
, is just the relation FV . On the other hand,
since  enter only bilinear 
part of the full Lagrangian in modB , varying modB  with respect to 
 (with keeping  
off-shell) yields the exact linear relation
F_(and c.c. )   FVP 
as the corresponding equation of motion. As the result, one can 
explicitly find the dual form of modB  in terms of 
 and , expressing
 and  from eq. FVP :
  [V,F(V,F^), F^] (U,F^)
 = _2(U,F^)+ E(-u,-u ) , where



The discrete self-duality now amounts to demanding the Lagrangian 
mediate  to have the same form in the variables  as the 
original Lagrangian  has in terms of . Comparing the 
dual Lagrangian mediate  with the original one legact , one firstly 
observes that  in mediate  looks the same in terms of the 
variables  as the original , eq. auxfree , in terms of 
. Then the necessary and sufficient condition of the discrete 
self-duality is the following simple restriction on the interaction 
function  E(,)=E(-,-) . discr2 
Another proof is an analog of the on-shell consideration based on eqs.
discrSO , Lambda , discinvar  in the standard formulation. Let us 
consider the transformation of  legact  with respect to a 
discrete version of the  transformations Vtrans 
&&F_V_Vdiscr 

&&(V,F)=_2(V,F)+E(-,-)+iPF-iPF .
By analogy with the condition discinvar  the requirement of discrete
self-duality in the -representation can now be reformulated as the 
-invariance of the following function:
I(F,V)=(F,V)+i2 PF-i2 PF .
We end up with the same condition discr2  for .

Obviously, an arbitrary -invariant function 
 corresponding to a  duality-symmetric system
automatically satisfies the discrete self-duality condition discr2 .
This elementary consideration provides us with a simple proof of the fact
(mentioned in Sect. ) that the  duality-symmetric systems
constitute a subclass in the set of those revealing the discrete 
self-duality.


 D 

Eq. FV  (or eqs. algsc ) can be treated as an algebraic relation 
between two independent arguments of the function  legact .
Eliminating variables  in this function, one can define an on-shell
-representation of the general nonlinear Lagrangian
L[(, ), (, )] L (,) = E +12 (E_^2-
 2E_12 (E_^2- 2E_  hatLa 
However, this representation with  is not much helpful for
finding explicit examples of Lagrangians  in terms of 
the initial variables compl . It proves useful to define an alternative 
representation for the duality-symmetric Lagrangians,
, 
introducing new scalar auxiliary variables . Basic quantities of 
this -representation are related to the corresponding quantities of 
the -representation via the Legendre transformation. In Sect. 
we shall see that the defining algebraic equation of this
-representation is more convenient for constructing explicit solutions 
of the  duality condition than the analogous one in the 
-representation.

Let us introduce new complex scalar fields
(,)=E_ ,(,)=E_munu 
and consider the complex Legendre transformation 

E(,)-E_E_compLeg 
The corresponding inverse transformation is
E(,)=H(,)-H_H_compLeg1 
and
(,)=-H_ ,(,) = -H_ . nuK 
Note that the standard conditions stcond  for the function  
do not imply any restriction on the second derivatives of this function.
However, for the transformed function  to be analytic at the 
origin and, respectively, for the relation munu , nuK  to be 
invertible, one is led to impose the following subsidiary condition on the 
Jacobian  of the Legendre 
transformation:
J(0,0) 0 .Jacob 
It implies an analogous condition for  and selects those 
, the -expansion 
of which starts with a non-degenerate 2nd order term. Below we shall limit 
our study to such analytic functions .

Using eqs. munu ,GE  and exprG  one can find how  is mapped 
on the derivative 
(L_)=1+2L_ 1-2L_ =G^-1 -1 ,L_2(+1)  .muLvp 
The basic algebraic relation of the -representation algsc  can be 
transformed as follows
(,)=-(1+)^2H_(and c.c.)  .vpmurel 
In order to find the corresponding Lagrangian  one should
solve this basic relation for the function . This solution 
can be analyzed perturbatively for any real analytic function  (or ). 
However, the explicit solutions can be found only for some special cases.

Performing the Legendre transformation  in the 
Lagrangian hatLa  (with the condition Jacob  imposed) one can cast it 
in the -representation
L (,)=L [(,),(,)]=12 (1-
^2)H_+12 (1-^2)H_+H(,) .Dlagr 
It is interesting to note that this Lagrangian and the relation 
vpmurel  can be reproduced from an off-shell Lagrangian with  as 
an independent complex auxiliary field
 (,)=(2(1+) 
+(2(1+) +H(,) .Lvm 
Indeed, varying Lvm  with respect to  one obtains just eq. 
vpmurel . Substituting the latter back in Lvm , one recovers the 
on-shell representation , eq. Dlagr . The off-shell
Lagrangian  Lvm  is an analogue  of the auxiliary-field reformulations
of the Born-Infeld Lagrangian  (see Sect. ).

Since the auxiliary fields  and  are related via the Legendre
transform compLeg , compLeg1 , a similar off-shell Lagrangian should 
also exist for the on-shell -representation hatLa , with the 
 relation algsc  arising as the appropriate 
algebraic equation of motion for . However, the derivation of such a 
Lagrangian is not straightforward.

Let us turn to duality issues in the  representation. Using eq.
muLvp  and the formula  delta1  for the variation ,  
one can show that the  duality group acts on  as a linear 
 transformation
_Eq.corol  implies the relation
14 (1-4L^2_)=E_=-H_ .
Then the  duality condition sdI  in the -representation is 
equivalent to the condition of -invariance of 
&&_H= 2i(H_- H_) = 0  
H^ds (,)=I(b) ,
where  is a real  function of the invariant argument . 
The Jacobian condition Jacob  now amounts to the one-dimensional 
relations
_a(0)0  I_b(0) 0.Icond 
Thus the  solution of the  duality condition has the following form 
in the -representation:
(,)=-I_b ,-(1+)^2I_b.
phiR 
This solution is easily checked to provide the correct transformation rule 
for 
_+1 =4iL_ .
From the definition of  and the relations phiR  it is 
straightforward to derive
&&aERrel 

&&_a  d(a) da  =-(dI(b) db 
)^-1  .ERrel00 
The one-dimensional Legendre transform compLeg , compLeg1  for the 
-invariant functions in the - and -representations reads
(a)=I(b)-2bI_b, I(b) = (a) - 2a _a. 1dLeg 
Relations ERrel , ERrel00  can be directly derived from 1dLeg .

The general expression for the -representation of the  
duality-symmetric Lagrangian follows by substituting  for 
 into  defined by eq. Dlagr 
L ^ds (,)=12 (+)(1-b)I_b+I(b)
 .Klagr 
It possesses the correct  transformation properties
&&_L ^ds =i()

&&_(L ^ds -I) .
Eq. Lvm  with the substitution  provides an off-shell
description of the considered restricted class of the 
duality-symmetric theories in the  representation. Using eqs. 
muLvp  and phiR  one can find
L_  = 12 (1-^2)I_b
and, substituting this in Klagr , show that the analytic functions 
 satisfying the condition Icond  constitute a particular class of 
the invariant functions  defined in invar :



This class of functions  is characterized by the presence of
nonzero term of 4th order in Maxwell field strength in their 
-expansion,  .

Note that the general rescaling rescal  which preserves the  
duality corresponds in the -representation to the rescaling
. In particular, mirr  corresponds to the
reflection . In Sect. we shall consider the 
impact of this reflection on the Lagrangian of the Born-Infeld theory.

The basic algebraic problem of the -representation is to restore the
function  and then  by the given inverse 
function  in phiR . Once the latter function is analytic, 
the analyticity of  is guaranteed by the implicit function 
theorem. The basic algebraic equation for the function ,
(b+1)^2b[(+)-I_b(b-1)^2]^2Jphi ,
and  the corresponding representation for ,
 I_b(1-b^2) , muphi0 
follow from eqs. phiR . In the next Section we shall see that the 
relations Jphi  and muphi0  are helpful while seeking the explicit 
solutions of the  duality constraint.

Finally, let us analyze  the discrete duality of 
Dlagr . In the -representation, the appropriate discrete 
transformations are
(,)(-,-)=-(,) .
The discrete self-duality of  is then equivalent
to the symmetry
H(,)H(-,-)=H(,) ,
which guarantees the correct  transformation Lambda  of the 
full Lagrangian Dlagr .


C 

Born-Infeld theory 
The Lagrangian of the Born-Infeld theory has the following form in terms 
of complex invariants compl 
&& L(,) =
[1-Q(,)] , biact 
where
Q(,) = 1+X  ,X(, ) (+)+(1/4)(not 
The power expansion of the BI Lagrangian is
L=-12 (+)+12 -14 (+)
+18 (3+
^2+^2)+O(^5) . BIpert 
In the BI theory the function  defP  has the following explicit form
P_(F)=iL F^ 
=-iF_Q^-1 (,)[1+12 (and the basic -transformations of the scalar variable is
_[1+12 (Q  .
The function  relating the variables  and 
and defined by eq. exprG , is given by the expression
&&G=12 1 + Q^-1 
[1 + 12 (- )] . Gbi 
Let us first discuss the -representation of BI theory. It is easy to 
find the  relations
&& 2(1+)^2 
(1- )^2  , 2(1+)^2 
(1- )^2  ,zG 
which correspond to the following choice of the invariant function in
the -representation phiR :
 I(b)=2b b-1 , I_b = -2 (b-1)^2  RBI 
(with ). Using this choice of the auxiliary function in 
Jphi  we obtain the quadratic equation for the invariant variable 
 b^2+[2BIb 
The invariant and linearly transforming  functions  and  obtained 
by solving BIb  and using the general formulas muLvp  or muphi0  
are given by the expressions
b= [1+Q+12 (+)]^2  , G^-1 -1=Q-1-12 (Q+1+12 (KBI 
The corresponding representations for the off- and on-shell BI Lagrangian 
read
 (,)=2b b-1 +(2(1+) 
+(2(1+)  , L (,)=++2b b-1  .Kblag 
Note that  the authors of Ref. considered a polynomial
off-shell representation of the BI Lagrangian with two complex auxiliary 
fields. The  basic auxiliary field  of this representation is 
related to our fields  and  as follows
+12 2(+b) b-1  ,L (,)=-12 (+) .
Let us also study the original -representation for the BI case.
Our aim is to find  as a function of the variable
&&  a=4b (b-1)^4 
xG 
(recall eq. ERrel ). Introducing , one finds that 
 satisfies the following quartic equation:
 t^4 + t^3-14  = 0 ,  t(= =0) = -1 . quart 
It allows one to express  in terms of :
 t(a)=-1-a 4 +3a^2 16 -15a^3 64 +
 .
One can easily write a closed expression for  as the proper solution
of quart , but we do not present it here.

Now we are ready to find the invariant self-interaction  for
this case. Taking into account Eqs.RBI  and 1dLeg  we find a simple 
expression for the self-interaction through the real variables  or 
 (see also)
_ [a(b)]=2b(1+b) (1-b)^2 =2[2t^2(a)+3t(a)+1] =
a 2 -a^2 8 + 3a^3 32 + .
explE 
It is easy to show that Jphi  is reduced to quadratic equation only
for the one-parameter family of functions
I_b=-2r/(b-1)^2, RBI1 
which corresponds to performing the transformation rescal  in the BI 
Lagrangian biact . A new duality-symmetric Lagrangian (not reducible to 
the BI one) is obtained in the case 
L^(-) =-1+1-14 (=-1+1+E ^2-
B ^2-(E B )^2  ,
where  and  are electric and magnetic fields, 
respectively. This Lagrangian is obtained from the BI one biact  by 
changing its overall sign and making the replacement 
,
or
E B  ,B -E .
It would be interesting to find out the physical meaning and implications
of this "magnetic" counterpart of the BI theory.

Exact duality-symmetric Lagrangians corresponding to 
solvable algebraic equations 
The initial data for restoring  Lagrangians 
by the known function  in the -representation is the equation 
Jphi  for  and the following representation for the Lagrangian 
Klagr 
L ^ds  = -12 (1-b 1+b )[+ 
+ 4bI_b(b)]+ I(b), Lagrb 
which is obtained by substituting the expression muphi0  for  into
Klagr . The key idea of finding out new explicit examples of
duality-symmetric models is to pick up those  for which the basic 
eq. Jphi  is simplified as much as possible. Below we analyze several 
examples of the  function  which make Jphi  a solvable algebraic
equation for .

As already mentioned, the quadratic equation is obtained only in the case 
of BI theory RBI  and its "magnetic" counterpart RBI1  (with 
).

Next in complexity is the following  ansatz for 
I_b=-2-cb (1-b)^2   I(b) = (c-2)b 1 -b  + 
c(1-b), 3rdor 
where  is some constant and we employed the conditions 
. Being substituted into Jphi , this ansatz  gives the cubic 
algebraic equation for the unknown 
c^2b^3-b^2[4c+2c(+)+]+b[(++2)^2-2]-=0 .Jc 
It is straightforward to write down the explicit solution of this equation 
for  as the appropriate analytic function of 
 (vanishing at ) and to find the precise 
expression for the related  duality-symmetric Lagrangian by 
substituting this solution into Lagrb .

The case  yields the BI theory, while for any other value of 
we obtain new examples of the duality-invariant systems. In the special 
case ,  and  in eq.3rdor  are simplified to 
. With this choice, the relation between 
different auxiliary-fields representations is also simplified
&&a=4b (b-1)^2  ,b(a)=a+2-21+a  a  , 

&&(a)=2(1+a  -1)-212 (1+1+a ).
A different ansatz for  also leading to a comparatively simple 
algebraic equation for  is as follows
I_b=-21-cb  (b-1)^2  .
Eq. Jphi  is reduced to
(b+1)^21-cb ,
Jphi00 
which is equivalent to a quartic equation. In the limit  
eq. Jphi00  becomes quadratic and one recovers the BI theory.

One more solvable ansatz for  is
I_b=-21 (1-cb)(b-1)^2  .
It reduces Jphi  to the following quartic equation:





Discrete duality examples 

Let us firstly consider, directly in the original 
representation, two simple examples of the Lagrangians exhibiting
discrete self-duality.

The first example is the Lagrangian which depends on a single real variable 

L=1-1+  .
Another example is the holomorphic nonlinear Lagrangians
L_h(,)=l()+l() , l()=1-1+  .holom1 
It is a straightforward exercise to check that both these Lagrangians
respect self-duality under Legendre transformation as it was defined in
Subsect. 2.2. At the same time, they are not  duality-symmetric.

Two other examples of systems with a discrete duality can be introduced 
in the framework of -representation. The first one corresponds to 
the choice
E=12 N^2 ,N=+ ,
then after eliminating auxiliary fields the final Lagrangian 
 is a function of the single real variable . 
The basic algebraic equation is cubic
phN 
and it can be solved in radicals
&&N()=-23 +A_+()+A_-()=+ , 

&&A_()=[3]127 +2 B()  ,B()=127 +14 ^2.Despite the presence of radical  in ,
the function   is analytic.

More complicated Lagrangian corresponds to the following choice
of the even self-interaction function :
&&E(,)=12 (^2+^2) ,E_&&L^int (,)=12 (^2+^2)+^3+^3 .The holomorphic algebraic equation
 can be explicitly solved similarly to eq. phN . The corresponding 
Lagrangian  is holomorphic like holom1 .

Conclusion 
We introduced a new -representation for the Lagrangians of 
nonlinear electrodynamics and showed that it provides a simple 
description of systems exhibiting the properties of  duality or/and  
discrete self-duality in terms of real function of auxiliary bispinor 
complex fields, . This function encodes the entire 
self-interaction in the -representation. The duality properties 
prove to be related to some linear off-shell symmetries of this general 
function . We also defined an alternative -representation
and demonstrated its convenience and efficiency for constructing new 
explicit examples of duality-symmetric Lagrangians.

The auxiliary linearly transforming variables have also been used to
construct the general solution of the  duality constraint for the 
interaction of  Abelian gauge fields in. The generalization 
to the  case is a straightforward extension of the formalism 
described above, so we do not present it here and send the interested 
reader to Ref..

It is the interesting task to extend our consideration to the case of 
 and  supersymmetric extensions of nonlinear electrodynamics 
 in order to obtain a general characterization of the 
corresponding duality-symmetric systems. One more urgent problem is to 
define an analog (if existing) of the - representation for 
non-Abelian BI theory and its superextensions. It could shed more light 
on the structure of these theories which have deep implications
in string theory and still remain to be completely understood.
