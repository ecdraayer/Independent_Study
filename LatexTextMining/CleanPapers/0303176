We analyse some quantum multiplets associated with extended supersymmetries.
We study in detail the general form of the causal (anti)commutation relations.
The condition of positivity of the scalar product imposes severe restrictions
on the (quantum) model. It is problematic if one can find out quantum
extensions of the standard model with extended supersymmetries.

Introduction 
The construction of a model for the interaction of elementary particles
should have the ultimate goal of providing a quantum model. Indeed, from
the phenomenological point of view a classical Yang-Mills field is
without relevance. The standard model of the elementary particles
 is  basically a quantum model: to check it experimentally one
needs only the  Feynman rules i.e. the expressions for the propagators
and the vertices. But to give the propagators of some model is
equivalent to specify the set of quantum fields relevant for the model
and the expression of the vertices is nothing but the interaction
Lagrangian. So the phenomenological point of view fits very nicely with
the Bogoliubov version of perturbation theory; in this approach the
basic input is a given Hilbert space 

(which is taken of Fock type generated from the vacuum state by some set
of free quantum fields) and the interaction Lagrangian (which is some Wick
polynomial in these fields). So, all considerations of the standard model as
classical field theory followed by some quantization procedure should be viewed 
only as some auxiliary steps leading to the quantum model. It is not at all
clear if a quantization procedure really provides a Hilbert space description
of the classical model. This has to be checked in detail after the quantum
model has been constructed. In particular the positivity of the scalar product
is essential: otherwise we would have negative probabilities for some
transition processes. 

In two preceding papers, we have examined critically
the possible supersymmetric extensions of the standard model for the
case un-extended supersymmetry i.e. 
.
The main point was that the construction of an quantum supersymmetric
multiplet is more restrictive that the classical construction. The main
difference lies in the requirement that the multiplet has a bona fidae
representation in a Hilbert space. The formal construction of a quantum
supersymmetric multiplet is done by applying some (free) quantum fields on the
vacuum state: in the language of axiomatic field theory this means that we
construct the Borchers algebra (see for instance). However, one
has to provide a positively defined scalar product: only in this case
one gets from the Borchers algebra a Hilbert space by a standard procedure.
For free fields the scalar product can be obtained from the form of the
causal (anti)commutation relations using Kallan-Lehman representation
theorem. But the supersymmetric algebra puts severe restrictions on the most
general form of these causal (anti)commutators and it is not guaranteed that
the positivity can be always enforced. In we have found out that
this imposes severe restrictions one the free parameters of the model: in
particular the vector model has a Hilbert space representation only for
positive mass. 

In this paper we investigate critically other supersymmetric models based
on extended supersymmetries. We are interested only in models which can be
used for a supersymmetric extension of the standard model (SM) and without 
particles of spin higher that . From the analysis of the irreducible 
representations of the supersymmetric algebra it is known that there are only 
five multiplets describing irreducible representations with particles of spin
 namely (see for instance): for

the chiral multiplet and the vector multiplet; for

the hyper-multiplet and a vector multiplet; for

a vector multiplet. At the level of classical field theory these models have
been studied in detail: see for instance,,, 
,.

In this paper we analyze in the spirit of the last three cases. We 
find out that there are considerable difficulties to construct supersymmetric 
extensions of the standard model for

and

contrary to what it is asserted in the literature.

In Section  we provide a general discussion of extended supersymmetry
for quantum models. In Section  we consider a

extended model without central charges containing spin  particles. In
Section  we consider the so-called hyper-multiplet which can be
used to describe matter. In Section  we study a

extended model without central charges containing spin  particles. 
In principle the results from Sections  and  could be
used for construction supersymmetric extensions of the standard model of
elementary particles but we point out some problems in achieving
this goal.

Extended Supersymmetries 

We remind here the definition of a extended supersymmetric theory in a
pure quantum  context.   We use the notations from.

The conventions are the following: (a) we use summation over dummy indices;
(b) we raise and lower Minkowski 
indices with the Minkowski pseudo-metric

with diagonal
;
(c) we raise and lower Weyl indices with the anti-symmetric 
-invariant
tensor
;
(d) we denote by

the usual Pauli matrices with elements denoted by

and the convention
.

Suppose that we have a quantum theory of free  fields; this means that
we have the following construction:
 

is a Hilbert space of Fock type (associated to some one-particle Hilbert space
describing some choice of elementary particles) with the scalar product
;

is a special vector called the vacuum;
 
is a unitary irreducible representation of 

the universal covering group of the proper orthochronous Poincare group such
that 
 
is translation in the Minkowski space and 
;

is a unitary representation of the compact group  (usually

or 
);

commutes with
 
 (resp. )
are the quantum free fields of integer (resp. half-integer) spin. We assume
that the fields are linearly independent up to equations of motion;
The  equations of motion do not connect distinct fields. 

In this paper, we considers only particles of spin
.
All fields verify Klein-Gordon equation; if the Fermionic fields
are Majorana they verify Dirac equation.

Now we define the notion of extended supersymmetry invariance of the system of 
Bosonic and Fermionic fields considered above. Suppose that in the Hilbert 
space 
 
we also have the operators

such that:

(i) the following relations are verified:
Q_ja  = 0, Q _ja   = 0
 [ Q_ja , P_  ] = 0, U_A ^-1  Q_ja  U_A  = A_a  ^b  Q_jb , A SL(2,)


V_U ^-1  Q_ja  V_U  = (U)_jk  Q_ka , U G
and
 Q_ja  , Q_kb   = _ab  Z_jk ,  Q_ja  , Q _kb    = 2 _jk ^ _ab   
P_ , 
Here

are the infinitesimal generators of the translation group given by
[P_ , b ] = - i _  b, [P_ , f ] = - i _  f,
Q _jb   (Q_jb )^ ,

are the so-called central charges  and, by definition, they commute with
all other SUSY generators and
 
is -dimensional a representation of the group . We will consider only the
case
.    

(ii) The following commutation relations are true:
i [ Q_ja , b ] = p_j () f
 Q_ja , f  = q_j () b


i [ Z_jk , b ] = p_jk () b
i [ Z_jk , f ] = q_jk () f.
Above  (resp. ) is the collection of all integer (resp. half-integer) 
spin fields and  are matrix-valued polynomials in the partial derivatives

(with constant coefficients). These relations express the tensor properties 
of the fields with respect to (infinitesimal) supersymmetry transformations. 

If this conditions are true we say that

are super-charges  and

are forming a supersymmetric multiplet . The notion of 
irreducibility  can be defined for any supersymmetric multiplet if
we consider the quantum fields as a modulus over the ring of partial
differential operators. As emphasized in, the matrix-valued 
operators
 and 
are subject to some constraints which generalize the case

(see and). 
 
From the compatibility of () with Lorentz transformations it
follows that these polynomials are Lorentz covariant.
The equation of motion are supersymmetric invariant, i.e. if we take the 
commutator of the supercharges

and

with the equations for the Bosonic fields we obtain zero modulo the equation
of motion for the Fermionic fields and vice-versa.
To verify the validity of () it is necessary and sufficient to prove
they commute with all the fields 
 and 
of the model: 
 [  Q_ja  , Q_kb   - _ab  Z_jk , b ] = 0, [  Q_a  , Q _b    - 2 ^ _ab   P_  , b ] = 0


 [  Q_a  , Q_b   - _ab  Z_jk , f ] = 0, [  Q_a  , Q _b    - 2 ^ _ab   P_  , f]  = 0;
this follows from () and the fact that the Hilbert space is generated 
by vectors of the type
= b_J_1  (x_1 ) b_J_p  (x_p ) 
f_A_1  (y_1 ) f_A_q  (y_q ) H .
Using the (graded) Jacobi identities it follows that we must check:

 Q_ja  , [ Q_kb , b ]   
-  Q_kb  , [ b, Q_ja  ]  
+ [ b , _ab  Z_jk  ] = 0


[ Q_ja  ,  Q_kb , f  ] 
+ [ Q_kb  ,  f, Q_ja   ] 
+ [ f, _ab  Z_jk  ] = 0


 Q_ja  , [ Q _kb  , b ]  
-  Q _kb   , [ b, Q_ja  ]  
+ [ b, 2 jk  ^ _ab   P_  ] = 0


[ Q_ja  ,  Q _kb  , f  ] 
+ [ Q _kb   ,  f, Q_ja   ] 
+ [ f, 2 jk  ^ _ab   P_  ] = 0.
Causal (anti)commutation relations are verified by the free fields
 and :
 [ b(x), b(y) ] = - i p() D(x-y)  f(x), f(y)  = - i q() D(x-y)
where  is Pauli-Jordan causal distribution. Reasoning as above it follows
that new consistency relations are valid following again from (graded) Jacobi 
identities; the non-trivial ones are:
[ b(x),  f(y), Q_ja   ] +  f(y), [ Q_ja , b(x) ]  = 0
If one considers higher-spin fields (more precisely
),
is necessary to extend 
somewhat this framework: one considers in 

besides the usual positive definite scalar product a non-degenerate 
sesqui-linear form

which becomes positively defined when restricted to a factor Hilbert space

where  is some gauge charge . We denote with

the adjoint of the operator  with respect to
.

The gauge supercharge  it is usually determined by relations of the type 
() involving ghost fields also, so it means that we must impose 
consistency relations of the same type as above. Moreover, it is desirable to 
have
 Q, Q_ja   = 0,  Q, Q _ja    = 0;
this implies that the supersymmetric charges

and

factorizes to the physical Hilbert space
.
This implies new consistency relations of the type ()
with one of the supercharges replaced by the gauge charge:

  Q_ja  , [ Q, b ]  +  Q , [ Q_ja , b ]  = 0
 [ Q_ja  ,  Q, f  ] + [ Q,  Q_ja , f  ] = 0.
A relation of the type () must be also valid for the 
gauge charge:
[ b(x),  f(y), Q  ] +  f(y), [ Q , b(x) ]  = 0.
To have

we must also impose
  Q, [Q , b ]  = 0 [ Q,  Q, f  ] = 0.

In the presence of a gauge charge one can relax (): Indeed one
can factorize the supercharges and the representation of the Poincare group
to the physical Hilbert space

and require the () are valid only for these factorized operators
.

 with the internal symmetry group 
and without central charges 

 
Let us consider the multiplet 

where:
 

are two complex Bosonic scalar field which are 

scalars; 

are complex Bosonic fields which are
 
scalars and such that
F_ab  = F_ba ;

are complex Bosonic fields which verify
V_U ^-1  C_jk  V_U  = U_jl  U_km  C_lm , U SU(2)
and such that
C_jk  = C_kj ;

are Fermionic Dirac spinor fields and verifying
V_U ^-1  _ja  V_U  = U_jk  _k , V_U ^-1  _ja  V_U  = U_jk  _ka , U SU(2).

The action of the supercharges on these fields is well defined through:
i [ Q_ja , z ] = _ja  [ Q _ja  , z ] = 0.
 [ Q_ja  , F_bc  ] = _ab  _jc  + _ac  _jb 
 [ Q _ja  , F_bc  ] = - i _jk  
(^ _ca   _ _kb 
+ ^ _ba   _ _kc )
 [ Q_ja  , C_kl  ] = 
- (_jk  _la  + _jl  _ka )
 [ Q _ja  , C_kl  ] = i ^ _ba  _ 
( _jk  _l ^b  + _jl  _k ^b )
 [ Q_ja  , D ] = 0
[ Q _ja  , D ] = 
2i _jk ^ _ba   _ _k ^b 
 Q_ja , _kb   = _jk  F_ab  + _ab  C_jk 
 Q_ja ,  _kb    = 2 _jk  ^ _ab  
_ z^* 
 Q_ja , _kb   = _jk  _ab  D
 Q _jb  , _ka   = 
- i ( _jk  ^ _cb   ^cd _ F_ad 
+ _jl  ^ _ab   _ C_lk ).
If the field  verifies the Klein-Gordon equation for mass  then all
fields of the multiplet verify the same equation. 
Proof: 
One can start from the existence of the fields  and 

derive the other fields of the multiplet from the Jacobi identities 
(). 
 
From the relation involving;

and  we get that the expression

is antisymmetric in the couples
 
and 
 
so if we define
F_ab  12  _jk   Q_ja , _kb  , C_jk  12  ^ba   Q_ja , _kb  
we obtain the action of the supercharge

on
.
The relation involving

The relation involving

and 

leads us to the introduction of a new field
_ja  - 13  _kl  [Q_ka , C_jl  ]
and the action of the supercharge

on

and

follows.
The relation involving

give the action of

on
.
The relation involving

and 

leads us to the introduction of a new field
d_ab  _kl   Q_kb , _la  ;
one finds out the this expression must be antisymmetric in  and  so in
fact the new field is the (complex) scalar field  such that:
d_ab  = 12  _ab  D;
we now have the action of

on
.
The relation involving

is an identity.
The relation involving

Finally one notices the compatibility with the  transformations of
all the relations from the statement.


It is convenient to replace

by new fields; we proceed in two stages with two elementary proposition.
 
We can write uniquely
F_ab  = ^ _ab  F _ 
if we impose antisymmetry and the duality condition
F _  = F _ , ^  F _  = F ^ . 
Then the action of the supercharges on the new fields is:
 [ Q_ja  , F _  ] = ^ _ab  _j ^b 
 [ Q _ja  , F _  ] = 12  _jk  
(^ _ba   ^ _k ^b 
- ^ _ba   ^ _k ^b 
+ i ^  _ba   
_ _k ^b ).
Indeed, then we have:
F _  = - 12  ^ _ab  F^ab .
 
Let us define the real fields:
F_  i 2  ( F _  - F _ ^* );
then the correspondence

is one-one and the action of the supercharges on the new fields is:
 [ Q_ja , F^  ] = i 2  ^ _ab  _j ^b 
+ i4  _jk  
(^ _ab   ^  _k ^b  
- ^ _ab   ^  _k ^b  
- i ^  _ab   
_  _k ^b  ).

Indeed the correspondence is one-one because we have
F _  = F_  - i 2  _ 
F^ .
The preceding multiplet is reducible. 
 
The condition
C_jk ^*  = _jl  _km  C_lm 
is compatible with the  transformations. It is consistent with the
action of the supercharges from the preceding theorem iff  we also have:
_ja  = i _jk  ^ _ab   
_  _k ^b  
D = - 2 i ^2 z^* 
^ _ F_  = 0.
Proof: 
One starts from the first constrain and by commuting with the supercharges
gets new constraints. Then we one iterates the procedure and, hopefully, it
will close after a finite number of steps. 
 
We commute the constrain () with the supercharge

and obtain ().
The commutator of () with the supercharge

is an identity.
We anticommute the constraint () with the supercharge

and obtain ().
We anticommutator the constraint () with the supercharge

and we obtain ().
The commutator of () and () with the supercharges

are identities if we use the preceding constraints.


It follows that the reduced multiplet can be described as follows:
 
The reduced multiplet is composed of the fields

verifying the restrictions
C_jk  = C_kj , C_jk ^*  = _jl  _km  C_lm 
F_  = - F_ , ^ _ F_  = 0.
The action of the supercharges on these fields is well defined by:
i [ Q_ja , z ] = _ja  [ Q _ja  , z ] = 0.
 [ Q_ja , F^  ] = i2  _jk  
(^ _ab   ^  _k ^b  
- ^ _ab   ^  _k ^b  )
 [ Q_ja  , C_kl  ] = - i ^ _ab  _ 
(_jk  _lm   _m ^b   
+ _jl  _km  _m ^b  )
 [ Q _ja  , C_kl  ] = i ^ _ba  _ 
( _jk  _l ^b  + _jl  _k ^b )
 Q_ja , _kb   = - 2 i _jk  ^ _ab  F_  
+ _ab  C_jk 
 Q_ja ,  _kb    = 2 _jk  ^ _ab  
_ z^* .

The preceding multiplet can be reduced even further. We have:
 
In the preceding conditions the relations
C_jk  = 0
^ _ab  _  _j ^b   = 0
^2 z = 0
^ F_  = 0
are supersymmetric invariant. In particular we can consider the multiplet

of zero mass fields such that

verifies Dirac equation of zero mass and

verifies the restrictions
F_  = - F_ , ^ _ F_  = 0 ^ F_  = 0.
The action of the supercharges is well defined by:
i [ Q_ja , z ] = _ja  [ Q _ja  , z ] = 0.
 [ Q_ja , F^  ] = i2  _jk  
(^ _ab   ^  _k ^b  
- ^ _ab   ^  _k ^b  )
 Q_ja , _kb   = - 2 i _jk  ^ _ab  F_  
 Q_ja ,  _kb    = 2 _jk  ^ _ab  
_ z^* .

We call this multiplet the new reduced multiplet .

We can make now the connection with the notations of. We have to
show that the fields

are transforming according to the vector representation of
.
Indeed we have
 
(i) In the preceding conditions, let us define the operator-valued 

matrix  with elements
H_jk  C_jl  _lk .
Then we have
H^T  =  H V^-1 _U  H V_U  = U H U^* , U SU(2).
(ii) Any 

matrix  verifying the relation () can be uniquely written in the 
form
H = _j=1 ^3  C_j  _j 
(where

are the Pauli matrices) so () is equivalent to
V^-1 _U  C_j  V_U  = (U)_jk  C_k .
Here 

is the covering map.
Proof: 
The relations (i) are elementary and the writing () follows from



The relation () tells us that the multiplet of fields

transforms according to the vector representation of
.


Now the multiplet described in by the rules (12)+(16) coincides with
the multiplet from our theorem : indeed, up to some factors
we have the correspondence:
z = A + i B, _1a  = p_a , _2a  = p_a , 
F^  = V^  Q_1a  = Q_a , Q_2a  = Q_a .


The new reduced multiplet corresponds to (18) from. Let us
remember that the action of the supercharges on the fields described in
theorem  implies that we do have () without central
charges;  in fact, we have derived the action of the supercharges
imposing this conditions, the relations () being generic for a
supersymmetry algebra. A posteriori we have () for
theorems  and . In it is asserted that
the anticommutation relations between supercharges corresponding to 
 
and  
  
are unconstrained; according to our analysis this is not true.

Now we determine the possible form of the causal (anti)commutator relations.
We have the following result:
 
Let us suppose that for the multiplet of Theorem  the field  is a 
complex scalar field of mass 
;
in particular we have
 [ z(x), z(y) ] = 0
 [ z(x), z^* (y) ] = - i D_m (x-y).
Then we also have:
 [ F_ab (x), F_cd (y) ] = i  
(_ac  _bd  + _ad  _bc ) D_m (x-y)
 [ F_ab (x), F_c d  ^* (y) ] = 
2 i ( ^ _ac   ^ _bd  
+ ^ _ad   ^ _bc  ) 
_ _ D_m (x-y)
 [ C_jk (x), C_lm (y) ] = - i 
(_jl  _km  + _jm  _kl ) D_m (x-y)
 [ C_jk (x), C_lm ^* (y) ] = - 2 i m^2 
(_jl  _km  + _jm  _kl ) D_m (x-y)
 [ D(x), D^* (y) ] = - 4 im^2  D_m (x-y)
 [ z(x), D(y) ] =  D_m (x-y)
 _ja (x),  _kb  (y)  =
2 _jk  ^ _ab   _ D_m (x-y)
 _ja (x),  _kb  (y)  =
2 _jk  m^2  ^ _ab   _ D_m (x-y)
 _ja (x), _kb (y)  
= - i  _ab  _jk  D_m (x-y),
and all other (anti)commutators are zero. Here

is a free parameter. 
Proof: 
From Lorentz covariance considerations we must have:
 [ z(x), F_ab (y) ] = 0,  [ z^* (x), F_ab (y) ] = 0
because there is no partial differential operator

symmetric in  and  and Lorentz covariant. We also must have
 [ z(x), D(y) ] =  D_m (x-y),  [ z(x), D^* (y) ] = ^  D_m (x-y)
with 
.

From consideration of Lorentz and  covariance we must also have:
 [ z(x), C_jk (y) ] = 0
because the only available combination



is in conflict with the symmetry property.

Starting from the hypothesis and the preceding relations one determines by some 
long but straightforward computation all the causal (anti)commutators from the
Jacobi identity (). In particular we get
.


Now we determine if the multiplets considered above do admit a representation
in a Fock space. We proceed in the spirit of the reconstruction theorem from
the axiomatic field theory. The key property is positivity. We suppose that
all the fields are free of mass . In this case it is known that it is
sufficient to verify the positivity of the -point function. We have
immediately
 
The field  has a representation in a Fock space iff 

Proof: 
Let us consider the real scalar fields

given by 
.
From the commutation relation for  we get:
[ D_r (x), D_s (y) ] = - 2i m^4  _rs  D_m (x-y) 
so the -points functions is obtained from the causal commutator with
the substitution
D_m  D_m ^(+) 
i.e. we keep only the positive frequency part of the Pauli-Villars commutator:
<, D_r (x) D_s (y) > = - 2 im^2  _rs  D^(+) _m (x-y);
this follows from Kallan-Lehman representation for the 2-point distribution
(see for instance, Introduction to QFT , Section 1.5).
If we consider the norm of an arbitrary one-particle state we get something
proportional to 

so the positivity condition follows.


To analyse the possibility of Hilbert space representations for the other
field more easily we rewrite some of the commutation  relations given
above using new fields. The first rewriting is elementary in  terms of
the fields 
.
 
The causal commutation relations for the field

are
[ F_ (x), F_ (y) ] = - i2 
( g_  _ _ 
- g_  _ _ 
+ g_  _ _ 
- g_  _ _ ) D_m (x-y)


+ i8  [ Re() - 2 m^2  ] 
( g_  g_  - g_  g_  ) D_m (x-y)
+ i8  Im() _  D_m (x-y). 
In particular the field has a representation in a Fock space if and only if
. 
Proof: 
The commutation relation is obtained by a straightforward computation. The 
-point function is again obtained from the causal commutator with the
substitution (). The computation of the norm of an arbitrary
one-particle state 
dx f^ (x) F_ (x) where

are test function (antisymmetric in  and ) gives
^2  = - 2d^+ _m (p) 
f  ^ (p) f _ (p)


+ 2  [ Re() - 2 m^2  ] d^+ _m (p) 
f  ^ (p) f _ (p)
- 4  Im()  d^+ _m (p) ^ 
f  _ (p) f _ (p).
Here

is the Lorentz-invariant measure on the upper hyperboloid of mass ,

and by 

we denote the Fourier transform of . Now it is clear that the last two
contributions can have arbitrary signs so they must be identically zero.
On the contrary, because of the transversality condition



the first contribution is positive.


To analyze the positivity condition for the fields

we proceed in the same spirit as for the complex field : we make a 
decomposition into real and imaginary parts but in a  covariant way.
 
Let us define the new fields
C _jk  
12  (C_jk  + _jl  _km  C_km ^* ), 
D _jk  
i2  (C_jk  - _jl  _km  C_km ^* ).
The correspondence

is one-one. These new fields verify the reality conditions
C ^* _jk  = _jl  _km  C _lm , 
D ^* _jk  = _jl  _km  D _lm  
and the causal commutators are:
[ C _jk (x), C ^* _lm (y) ] = - i 2  (2 m^2  + )
(_jl  _km  + _jm  _kl ) D_m (x-y)
[ D _jk (x), D ^* _lm (y) ] = - i 2  (2 m^2  - )
(_jl  _km  + _jm  _kl ) D_m (x-y)
[ C _jk (x), D _lm (y) ] = 0.
In particular the positivity condition is fulfilled iff
.
Proof: 
The commutators are obtained by elementary computation. If we consider now
the one-particle states
_1  dx f_jk (x) C ^* _jk (x) , _2  dx g_jk (x) D ^* _jk (x) where

are test functions (antisymmetric in  and ) then the norms are:
_1 ^2  = 2(2 m^2  + ) d^+ _m (p) 
f  _jk (p)^2  


_2 ^2  = 2(2 m^2  - ) d^+ _m (p) 
f  _jk (p)^2  
and we get the inequalities from the statement.


Comparing the last two corollaries we arrive at the conclusion that the
multiplet described in Theorem  does not  have a representation
in a Hilbert space (of Fock type). This conclusion makes the reduced multiplet
more interesting because in this case we have positivity.
 
The causal (anti)commutators for the reduced multiplet of Theorem are
 [ z(x), z^* (y) ] = - i D_m (x-y).
[ F_ (x), F_ (y) ] = - i2 
( g_  _ _ 
- g_  _ _ 
+ g_  _ _ 
- g_  _ _ ) D_m (x-y)
 [ C_jk (x), C_lm (y) ] = - 2 i m^2  
(_jl  _km  + _jm  _kl ) D_m (x-y)
 _ja (x),  _kb  (y)  =
2 _jk  ^ _ab   _ D_m (x-y).
This corresponds to
;
in particular we have

so

The positivity condition is verified in this case for
.
Proof: 
The computations are elementary: from the constraints we have
;
if we substitute this into the commutation relation of  with 
we get the value of . This in turn gives
 
and the commutators from the statement follows. If

we would get that the fields

are commuting among themselves so they cannot be represented as operators
in a Hilbert space. (They cannot be c-number fields because this would
contradict the relations from theorem ).


Let us remark that in the reduced multiplet is constructed for
.
Apparently one can make 

in theorem  at the purely algebraic level and still obtain a good
multiplet. However, according to our analysis the multiplet obtained after 
this limiting procedure will not have a representation in a Hilbert space.

For the new reduced multiplet we have similarly:
 
The causal (anti)commutators for the reduced multiplet of Theorem are
 [ z(x), z^* (y) ] = - i D_m (x-y).
[ F_ (x), F_ (y) ] = - i4 
( g_  _ _ 
- g_  _ _ 
+ g_  _ _ 
- g_  _ _ ) D_m (x-y)
 _ja (x),  _kb  (y)  =
2 _jk  ^ _ab   _ D_m (x-y).
The positivity condition is verified in this case.

The reduced (and the new reduced) multiplet describe particles of spin  
through the fields
. 
Indeed it is easy to see that the one-particle Fock subspace

generated from the vacuum by

describes the irreducible representation

of the Poincare group. For the reduced multiplet we must have

and for the new reduced multiplet we have
.

One can associate with every field of the multiplet from Theorem a superfield using a sandwich formula as in and: if
 is any field of the multiplet we define:
s(f) e^iS  f e^-iS 

where
S _jk (^a _j  Q_ka  
-  ^a  _j  Q _ka  );
here

are some arbitrary Grassmann parameters. The presence of the tensor

makes the construction -covariant. For instance, the superfield

verifies the following covariance property 
:
V_U ^-1  Z(x,) V_U  = Z(x, U) 
where we have defined the following action of  on the Grassmann 
variables:
(U)_ja  U_jk  _ka .
The superfield  is chiral i.e. we have
D _ja   Z = 0
where the covariant derivatives are defined as usual for both 
values of the index .

We also mention that the constraints ()-() can be
express compactly using the superfield 
D _ja   D _k ^a   Z 
+ _jl  _km  D _l ^a  D _ma  Z = 0.
The explicit expression for the superfield  is rather complicated and so is
the corresponding causal commutator.

Finally we investigate if it is possible to introduce in the game the
the electromagnetic potential
.

Apparently this is possible for the reduced multiplet because the constraint
() is the homogeneous Maxwell equation which tells us that
there exists

such that
F_  _ A_  - _ A_  
One needs the action of the supercharges on
.
There are two distinct possibilities. The simplest one is to observe that the 
"lift" the action of the supercharges on given by
 [ Q_ja , A^  ] = i2  _jk  
^ _ab    _k ^b  
is compatible with () and the action on the supercharges from the 
Theorem . The closeness of the supersymmetric algebra is more 
subtle and can be understood as in, Sect. 8. However, if one 
computes the causal commutators one finds out that the fields

causally commutes with every other fields (including themselves) so we do
not have a Hilbert space representation. The situation is better for the 
new reduced multiplet from Theorem  for which the non-trivial
causal (anti)commutators are:
 [ z(x), z^* (y) ] = - i D_m (x-y).
[ F_ (x), F_ (y) ] = - i4 
( g_  _ _ 
- g_  _ _ 
+ g_  _ _ 
- g_  _ _ ) D_m (x-y)
 _ja (x),  _kb  (y)  =
2 _jk  ^ _ab   _ D_m (x-y)
so we do have a Hilbert space representations.

The second possibility of introducing the field

is more logical. First one observes that for 

one can always transform an index  into an index  and vice-versa
using the Dirac operator. In particular, if we start from the basic field

of the multiplet appearing in Theorem  we can define
F_ab   ^ _cb   ^cd  
_ F_ad .


One can check two facts: (a) The association

one-one. Indeed, one easily get from the preceding definition
F_ab  = 1m^2   ^ _bc   ^c d   
_ F_ad  

which is the inverse of the map
.
(b) The new field

verifies the property
^ _bc   ^c d   _ F_ad  
= a b.


So the first step is to replace in the multiplet

by

One can give the action of the supercharges for the transformed multiplet:
 [ Q_ja  , F_bc   ] = _ab  ^ _dc  
_ _j ^d  - ^ _ac   
_ _jb 
 [ Q _ja  , F_bc   ] = - i _jk  
(^ _dc   ^ _ba  
_ _ _kb 
- m^2 _a c   _kb ).
We easily prove that for the reduced multiplet from Theorem  one
can impose the reality condition:
(F_ab  )^*  =  F_ba  .
Next, one defines
A_  14 m^2   ^ _ab   
^ac  ^b d   F_bd  . 
One can easily prove the following facts: (a) The association 

is one-one. (b) The field

verifies the transversality condition
^ A_  = 0;
(this follows from ()). (c) If the field

is real then the field

is also real and vice-versa.

This means that we can replace the (real) field

by the (real) field
.
The action of the supercharges in this new representation is:
 i [ Q_ja  , A_  ] = _ab  ^ _ab  
( g_  + 1m^2   _ _ )
 _k ^b  .
One can also compute the causal commutation relations for the new field

using the two successive transformations; one gets:
[ A_ (x), A_ (y) ] = i8  
( g_  + 1m^2   _ _ ) 
D_m (x-y).
The preceding two relations are compatible with the transversality property.
However one knows that in the usual formulation of the standard model one 
does not impose this transversality property so this multiplet
cannot be used for a supersymmetric extension of the standard model.

The  Hyper-multiplet 

We consider now a multiplet with  invariance and a non-trivial central
charge. It can be argued easily that we must have in ()
Z_jk  = _jk  Z
where  is a central charge and is a  scalar. Moreover we can suppose
that it is self-adjoint
Z^*  = Z.
We have now
 
Let us consider the multiplet 

where:
 

are complex Bosonic scalar field verify
V_U ^-1  _j  V_U  = U_jk  _k , V_U ^-1  f_j  V_U  = U_jk  f_k , U SU(2).

are Fermionic Dirac spinor fields which are  scalars.

The action of the supercharges and of the central charge on these fields is 
well defined through:
i [ Q_ja , _k  ] = _jk  _a 
i [ Q _ja  , _k  ] = _jk   _a  
 [ Q_ja  , f_k  ] = i_jk  ^ _ab  
_  ^b  
 [ Q _ja  , f_k  ] = - i _jk  
^ _ba   _ ^b 
 Q_ja , _b   = - 2 _ab  f_j 
 Q_ja ,  _b    = 2 _jk  ^ _ab  
_ _k ^* 
 Q_ja , _b   = 2 _jk  _ab  f^* _k 
 Q_ja ,  _b    = 2 ^ _ab  
_ _j 
i [ Z , _j  ] = f_j 
i [ Z, f_j  ] = i ^2  _j  
 [ Z , _a  ] = i ^ _ba  _  ^b  
 [ Z, _a  ] = - i ^ _ab  _  ^b  
If the fields 
 
verifies the Klein-Gordon equation for mass  then all fields of the 
multiplet verify the same equation. 
Proof: 
One assume that the action of the supercharges and of the central charge on 
 
is given by the formul from the statement and derive the others using
(). 
 
From the relation involving;

and 
 
we obtain the action of the supercharge

is an identity.
The relations involving a supercharge, the central charge and a fields
are identities. 
Finally one notices the compatibility with the  transformations of
all the relations from the statement.


Next, we analyze the possible causal (anti)commutation relation. We have
 
Let us suppose that for the multiplet of the preceding Theorem the fields 
 are complex scalar fields of mass 
;
in particular we have
 [ _j (x), _k (y) ] = 0
 [ _j (x), _k ^* (y) ] = - i _jk  D_m (x-y).
Then we also have:
 [ f_j (x), f^* _k (y) ] = -i m^2 _jk  D_m (x-y)
 [ _j (x), f_k (y) ] = _jk  D_m (x-y)
 [ _j (x), f^* _k (y) ] =  _jk  D_m (x-y)
 _a (x), _b (y)  = -2 i _ab  D_m (x-y)
 _a (x),  _b  (y)  =
2 ^ _ab   _ D_m (x-y)
 _a (x), _b (y)  = 
2 i   _ab   D_m (x-y),
 _a (x),  _b  (y)  =
2 ^ _ab   _ D_m (x-y)
 _a (x), _b (y)  = -2 i  _ab  D_m (x-y)
and all other (anti)commutators are zero. Here

and

are free parameters. 
Proof: 
From Lorentz and  covariance considerations we must have:
 [ _j (x), f_k (y) ] = _jk  D_m (x-y), [ _j (x), f^* _k (y) ] =  _jk  D_m (x-y)
Starting from the hypothesis and the preceding relations one determines by some 
computation all the causal (anti)commutators from the Jacobi identity 
(). 


Concerning the representability in a Hilbert space we have the following 
result:
 
The following multiplet has a representation in a Hilbert space iff
^2  + ^2  2.
Proof: 
For the Fermi sector we proceed as in i.e we suppose that the Hilbert
space is generated by the Majorana spinors

verifying the causal anticommutation relations:
 f^(A) _a (x), f^(B) _b (y)  
= i _AB  _ab  m  D_m (x-y),


 f^(A) _a (x), f ^(B) _b  (y)  =
_AB  ^ _ab   _ D_m (x-y).
So, we must have
= _A  c_A  f^(A)  = _A  d_A  f^(A) 
for some (complex) numbers



Like in we find out
 _a (x), _b (y)  
= i m c ^2  _ab  D_m (x-y),


 _a (x),  _b  (y)  =
c c ^*  ^ _ab   _ D_m (x-y)


 _a (x), _b (y)  
= i m d ^2  _ab  D_m (x-y),


 _a (x),  _b  (y)  =
d d ^*  ^ _ab   _ D_m (x-y)


 _a (x), _b (y)  
= i m c d  _ab  D_m (x-y),


 _a (x),  _b  (y)  =
c d ^*  ^ _ab   _ D_m (x-y).
By comparison we get
m c ^2  = - 2, c c ^*  = 2, m d ^2  = 2 , d d ^*  = 2, m c d  = - 2, c d ^*  =0.
We separate the real and the imaginary part of the vectors



and consider all possible Cauchy-Schwartz inequalities. As a result we get
^2  m^2 , ^2  + _1 ^2  m^2 .
For the Bosonic sector we simplify the reasoning by some field redefinitions.
If we consider instead of the fields

the new fields
F_j  f_j  + c_1  _j  + c_2  _jk  f_k ^*  
+ c_3  _jk  _k ^*  
then one can decouple the fields

from

if one chooses
c_3  = i (+   c_2 ), c_3  = i (- c_2 )

i.e. with this choice 

causally commutes with

and
.
Now we still have to check the positivity for the new fields
.
One finds out that
[ F_j (x), F_k (y) ] = -2 i _jk  D_m (x-y)
[ F_j (x), F^* _k (y) ] = -i (m^2  - ^2  - ^2 )
_jk  D_m (x-y).
We now make a new field transformation
g_j  F_j  + c _jk  F_k ^* 
and by a convenient choice of the constant  we arrive at the standard form:
[ g_j (x), g_k (y) ] = 0
[ g_j (x), g^* _k (y) ] = - i d _jk  D_m (x-y)
for some constant  which can be computed explicitly.
The positivity condition is

and give the relation from the statement which is stronger than the relation 
obtained in the Fermi sector.


The  multiplet 

We consider a model with 
 
invariance and no central charges.
 
Let us consider the multiplet 

where:
 

are complex Bosonic scalar fields antisymmetric in  and  and verifying
V_U ^-1  _jk  V_U  = U_jl  U_km  _lm , 
U SU(4);

are complex Bosonic fields which are  scalars;

are spinor Fermionic fields and verifying
V_U ^-1  _ja  V_U  = U_jk   _k , 
U SO(4).

The the action of the supercharges is well defined by:
i [ Q_ja , _kl  ] = _jklm  _ma 
i [ Q _ja   , _kl  ] = 
_jk   _la   - _jl   _ka  
 Q_ja , _kb   = _jk  F_ab 
 Q_ja ,  _kb    = 2 ^ _ab  
_ _jk 
[ Q_ja  , F_bc  ] = 0
[ Q _ja  , F_bc  ] = - 2i ^ _ca   _ 
_kb 
iff the following constraints are valid:
^2  _jk  = 0
^2  F_ab  = 0
^ _ab  _   ^b  _j  = 0,
F_ab  = F_ba 
^ _ab   ^ac  _ F_cd  = 0.
_jklm  _lm  = 2 _jk ^* 
Proof: 
One starts in a well known way from the first two relations and uses 
().
 
Consider the relation involving;

and 
.
If we define
F_ab   Q_jb , _ja  

we obtain the action of the supercharge

on

and the symmetry property ().
The relation involving

and 

is an identity.
The relation involving

and 

gives the action of the supercharge

on

and the constraint ().
The relation involving

and 

gives the constraint ().
The relation involving

and 

gives the action of the supercharge

on
.
The relation involving

and 

gives the action of 

on
.
The relation involving

and 

is an identity.
The relation involving

and 

gives the constraint ().
The relation involving

and 

gives the constraint ().

From () and the definition of

given above we also get (). Now we take the (anti)commutators of the 
supercharges with the constraints and obtain no new identities. The 

consistency of the relation from the statement is easy to obtain.


Let us remark that the anszatz regarding the action of the supercharges on

is quite general. If we can consider only 
 
covariance a more general situation of the type
i [ Q_ja , _kl  ] = 
_1  (_jk  _la  - _jl  _ka )
+ _1  _jklm  _ma 
i [ Q _ja   , _kl  ] = 
_2  (_jk   _la   
- _jl   _ka )
+ _2  _jklm   _ma  
is possible but one can prove that by clever redefinitions of the fields we 
we can make
.

To verify the positivity condition it is convenient to replace 

by

as in Section ; the action of the supercharges on

is
 [ Q_ja , F^  ] = i 4  
(^ _ab   ^  _k ^b  
- ^ _ab   ^  _k ^b  
- i ^  _ab   
_  _j ^b  )
and the field

must verify the consistency conditions
F_  = - F_  ^ F_  = 0 ^ _ F_  = 0.
Next, we consider the causal (anti)commutator relations. We have:
 
Let us suppose that for the preceding multiplet the field 
 
are complex scalar fields of zero mass; in particular we have
 [ _jk (x), _lm (y) ] = - i 
(_jl  _km  - _jm  _kl  ) D_0 (x-y)
which is compatible with the 

covariance properties. Then we also have:
 [ F_ab (x), F_c d  ^* (y) ] = 
2 i ( ^ _ac   ^ _bd  
+ ^ _ad   ^ _bc  ) 
_ _ D_0 (x-y)
 _ja (x),  _kb  (y)  =
2 _jk  ^ _ab   _ D_0 (x-y)
and all other (anti)commutators are zero. Alternatively, if we work with the 
field

the relation () can be replaced by:
[ F_ (x), F_ (y) ] = - i2 
( g_  _ _ 
- g_  _ _ 
+ g_  _ _ 
- g_  _ _ ) D_0 (x-y)
which is compatible with the constraints (). The positivity 
condition is verified for this model.
Proof: 
The compatibility of () with the 

covariance properties is elementary. From Lorentz covariance considerations we 
must have:
 [ _jk (x), F_ab (y) ] = 0,  [ _jk ^* (x), F_ab (y) ] = 0
because there is no partial differential operator

symmetric in  and  and Lorentz covariant. 

Starting from the hypothesis and the preceding relations one determines by some 
computation all other causal (anti)commutators from the using 
Jacobi identity (). One can easily check that these 
(anti)commutation relations are compatible with the constraints () -
(). Only the positivity of the field

requires some work and it is done as in Corollary .


We investigate if it is possible to introduce in a consistent way the
the electromagnetic potential
.
The standard construction from the literature - see for instance Sect. 
13, formul (13.11) - consists of replacing 

by
.
and postulation the following action of the supercharges 
i [ Q_ja , _kl  ] = _jk  _la  - _jl  _ka 
i [ Q _ja   , _kl  ] = _jklm   _ma  
 Q_ja , _kb   = -i _jk  ^ _ab  F_ 
 Q_ja ,  _kb    = 2 ^ _ab  
_ _jk ^* 
i [ Q_ja , A^  ] = ^ _ab    _j ^b  
where
F_  _ A_  - _ A_ .  
One can prove as in, Section 8 that SUSY algebra is full-filed on the
physical space
.
However the model does not have a representation in a Hilbert space! The reason
is that the Jacobi identity
[ A^ (x_1 ), _ja (x_2 ), Q_kb   ]
+ _ja (x_2 ), [Q_kb , A^ (x_1 ) ]  = 0
cannot be satisfied.

Alternatively if we want to solve the constraints () in terms of some 
electromagnetic potential

we first have from the third constraint that



and the second constraint gives



but such a fields does not have a Hilbert space representation.
So it seems that the 

model considered above cannot be used for a supersymmetric extension of the 
standard model.
Conclusions 

The analysis from this paper shows that a quantum supersymmetric
extension of  the standard model using extended supersymmetry is
problematic. The main  reason comes from the severe restrictions on the
causal (anti)commutator  relations  imposed by the positivity condition
(which give a well-defined scalar product  of the model). This is a
serious problem for string theory which seems to predict that the
standard model should be necessarily be an extended supersymmetric one.
For other models the situation is even more dramatic.  Consider for
instance the super-gravity multiplet Ch. 9. There one  tries
to extend the linearized Einstein gravity i.e. one describes gravitation
using the field

symmetric in the indices and which is the first order approximation of the 
metric tensor
.
From the analysis of the irreducible representations of the supersymmetric 
algebra one knows that the multiplet should also contain a Rarita-Schwinger 
field 

of spin 
. 
The theory is considered at the classical level. It particular this means that
in the relations () one should replace the (anti)commutators by an 
action of the supercharges on the supersymmetric manifold with coordinates

and their derivatives. At the level of a classical field theory the 
supersymmetric algebra closes (up to gauge transformations) only if one uses 
the (linearized) Einstein equations. However, if one tries to construct the
corresponding quantum multiplet one finds out that it is not possible to
quantize the field

such that the Einstein field equations are verified by the quantum operators:
the most general form of the causal commutation relations for

is not compatible with the (linearized) Einstein equations. The argument 
remains the same even if one introduces the auxiliary fields
.
(A good quantization procedure for the field

can be found in,). This spoils completely the 
verification of the supersymmetric algebra! 

So, we point out that a quantum construction of supersymmetric multiplet is
more restrictive than the corresponding construction for the classical model.
However, only the quantum model is relevant for any attempt of generalizing
the standard model of elementary particles.

One can see that the restrictions leading to the negative results obtained
in this paper and in the preceding one come from the identity
(). One way to circumvent this restriction is to accept that
the supersymmetry is spontaneously broken. This is in agreement with 
phenomenology which failed to find out supersymmetric partners of the known
elementary particles of equal mass. It is obvious that in a broken 
supersymmetric theory the supercharges 

cannot exist. Indeed, the existence of the supercharges and the postulated
relations () lead in all known cases to the equality of the masses
of the Bosons and Fermions. This cannot be saved even if one modifies 
() by adding some constants in the right hand side as it is 
suggested in the literature. The standard literature on spontaneous broken
symmetries suggests indeed that in such a case the charges do not exists but
one hopes to to have the currents as well defined objects and the symmetry 
group of the model is replaced by a current algebra. If such a framework
could be constructed in a supersymmetric model we would expect that 
() are replaced by other relations expressing the (anti)commutation
relations of the supercurrents and the fields. If in () and
() one replaces the supercharges by the the supercurrents then
less severe restrictions would appear; in particular one would not be
forced to have equal masses. This approach seems worthwhile investigating.
