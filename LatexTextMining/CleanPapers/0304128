The Exact Superconformal R-Symmetry Maximizes

An exact and general solution is presented for a previously open problem. 
We show that the superconformal R-symmetry of any 4d SCFT is exactly
and uniquely determined by a maximization principle: it is the
R-symmetry, among all possibilities, which (locally) maximizes the combination
of 't Hooft anomalies .  The
maximal value of  is then, by a result of Anselmi et. al.,
the central charge  of the SCFT.  Our  maximization
principle almost immediately ensures that the central charge
 decreases upon any RG flow, since relevant deformations force
 to be maximized over a subset of the previously
possible R-symmetries.  Using  maximization, we find the
exact superconformal R-symmetry (and thus the exact anomalous
dimensions of all chiral operators) in a variety of previously
mysterious 4d  SCFTs.  As a check, we verify that our exact
results reproduce the perturbative anomalous dimensions in all
perturbatively accessible RG fixed points.

Introduction 

The 4d  superconformal algebra is , whose bosonic
part is .  Thus every  superconformal
field theory (SCFT) must have a conserved  symmetry, whose
current is in the same superconformal multiplet as the stress-energy
tensor.  There might be additional global flavor symmetries ; the full
symmetry group of the  SCFT is then . The
additional global symmetry  acts as a "non-R" symmetry (i.e.  the
supercharges are invariant). For example,  SQCD is
believed to flow to an interacting SCFT for  in the range
 , and the additional global symmetry of the
SCFT is .  

The  symmetry residing in  yields important and
exact  results for SCFTs. 
For example, all operators  have dimension  which
satisfy
(O)32 R() and 
(O)-32 R(), 
with  the  charge of .  The first inequality is
saturated for pure chiral primary operators (which have positive
R-charge), and the second for pure anti-chiral operators
(which have negative R-charge).
Since the   charge of composite operators is simply additive,
so are the anomalous dimensions of composite chiral primary
operators; this is the statement that they form
a chiral ring, with non-singular mutual OPE.  

The condition that the  global symmetry be free of ABJ type
anomalies, i.e. that -charge conservation must not be violated in any
gauge field instanton backgrounds, is precisely the condition that the
NSVZ exact beta functions  vanish for all gauge groups.

Another remarkable utility of the superconformal  symmetry
was found by Anselmi et. al. ,  : the  't Hooft
anomalies completely determine the  and  central charges of
the superconformal field theory:
a=332 (3R^3-R), c=132 (9 R^3-
5R).   Because of 't Hooft anomaly matching, this means that these
central charges can be computed simply in terms of the weakly coupled
UV spectrum, even for highly interacting IR fixed points.  It is
believed that the central charge  obeys the 4d analog of
Zamolodchikov's c-theorem : Under any renormalization group flow,
perturbing away from any UV fixed point and flowing to a new IR fixed
point reduces the central charge: .  This was verified
to be the case in many supersymmetric examples by using , as in
,  .  See  for some more recent developments.

So the superconformal R-symmetry is extremely useful...provided that
it can be found!   The symmetry constraints generally do not
uniquely determine  whenever   is non-trivial.  This is because,
if  is some valid  symmetry, then so is 
R_t=R_0+_I s_I F_I, 
where  are all of the non-R flavor charges in the global symmetry group 
  We emphasize
that all currents in  are bona fide symmetries, which are
anomaly free and respected by all superpotential terms. In particular,
we are not considering the situation discussed in e.g. ,
 ,  of the RG flow of the  current in the stress tensor
supermultiplet, between its weak coupling expression and that of the
IR fixed point SCFT.  We are not considering RG flows here, only
aspects of the interacting SCFT RG fixed points.  and  are arbitrary  
real parameters.  The superconformal  corresponds
then to some particular choice  of these parameters, and we need
something beyond just symmetry considerations to determine what these are.  

There are some physical requirements which sometimes help. For
example, the superconformal  should commute with the
non-Abelian flavor symmetries, so we can restrict the linear
combination in  only to those Abelian flavor generators which
commute with all non-Abelian elements of .  For the example of
SQCD, this uniquely fixes , once we put in the additional
physical requirement that baryons and anti-baryons have the same
superconformal R-charge.  Another physical requirement is that all
chiral operators must have positive R-chargeA stronger condition
is that all gauge invariant chiral operators must have  charge
, with  the charge iff it's a free
field.  But, when this stronger condition appears to be violated, it
actually just means that the corresponding operator is actually
free field, and there's then some accidental extra symmetry which
mixes with  to make . .

In general, however, the superconformal R-symmetry is not uniquely
determined on symmetry grounds or the above considerations.
One well-known example is  SQCD with an added adjoint
and zero superpotential.  Because no other condition to determine the
superconformal R-symmetry had been previously known (as far as we are
aware), it had not been possible to apply the above powerful
constraints of superconformal invariance to generic  SCFTs.

We will here present and explore a simple prescription for uniquely
and exactly determining the exact superconformal  for any 4d
SCFT.  The idea is to parametrize the most general possible R-symmetry
as in .  The subscript  is for "trial."  The
superconformal  then corresponds to some
particular values, ,
R = R_0 + _I s_I F_I; 
our goal then is to determine the values of the .  What
we show is that the  can be uniquely determined by
imposing the following conditions on the 't Hooft anomalies:
9(R^2 F_I)=F_I, 
where  is the  and  are
all flavor charges in ,  
and also 
R F_I F_K <0,  specifically this matrix has all
negative eigenvalues for all flavor symmetries.  
We will prove  and  using general properties of 4d 
SCFTs.   Plugging  into  leads to a quadratic equation for 
each of the .  Then  uniquely determines which are
the correct roots of the quadratic equations.  

The identities  and  have a nice interpretation.  Introduce 
a_trial (s)332 (3 R_t^3-R_t) 
for the general trial  symmetry as a function of the parameters
.  When  are the special values , where 
becomes the , the value of  is
the central charge  of the SCFT, as in  .  The conditions  
and  can be equivalently stated: the 
 is precisely that which (locally) 
maximizes  !  This is simply because
a(s)s_I =332 
(9R_t^2F_I- F_I) and ^2 a(s)s_Is_K =2716  R_t F_IF_K. 
So  and   together imply that, among all possible R-symmetries,
the  is that which (locally) maximizes .  


As an example of how  maximization determines the superconformal
, consider the case of a free theory
of  vector multiplets and  chiral multiplets ,
, with trial charges .  We then have
a_trial =332 ( 2 +_i 
[3(r_i-1)^3-(r_i-1)]). 
If we now extremize with respect to the , we get
(r_i-1)^2=19 , 
with  the root which is a local maximum and  the
root which is a local minimum.  Our general identities  and 
imply that the correct superconformal R-symmetry in this case is to
take  as the charge of all chiral superfields.  This is indeed the
correct result for the free theory and, at this local maximum,
a=a_free =316 +148 M.   Note that, because 
 is a cubic function of the
, there is no global maximum or minimum: 
if we take .

A couple of comments:
1.  If a flavor symmetry  has vanishing 't Hooft anomaly, 
, then the condition  becomes .  For
non-Abelian flavor symmetries (which satisfy  simply by
tracelessness of the generators)  and for baryon number, the solution
of  is to take  to commute with .  This is as
expected on physical grounds.  The condition  then generally
imposes a non-trivial condition on SCFTs: since the non-Abelian flavor
generators have positive ,  implies that the 
charge of all matter fields transforming in non-Abelian flavor
representations must satisfy , so the fermion component has
negative R-charge.

2.   The  maximization principle almost  
immediately ensures the
 theorem:  for any RG flow between UV and IR fixed
points.  The reason is that generally ,
since the relevant deformations of the UV theory break some of the
flavor symmetries This also applies to Higgsings, if we
interpret  as also containing the global component of the gauge
group, which mixes with the flavor symmetries upon Higgsing.  The
previous comment ensures that  commutes with the global component
of the gauge group too. .  Since at the IR fixed point  is
maximized over a subspace of the parameter space of UV fixed point,
the maximal value will be smaller, showing that .  The
"almost " is because of two potential inadequacies in this
argument.  The first is that sometimes there are additional,
accidental flavor symmetries of the IR fixed point, so sometimes 
 isn't a subset of .  The second caveat is that, since
the  maximum is only a local maximum, it's possible for the
maximal value on a restricted subspace to actually exceed that of the
larger parameter space, e.g. one could get a larger value than 
if some added interaction restricts some of the R-charges to a
subspace where they're sufficiently large.  So the  theorem
requires that those relevant deformations which can drive the theory
to a new RG fixed point can't possibly restrict the possible 
charges to a subspace where some are extremely large.  This fits with
the constraint mentioned in comment 1, and with the intuition that
interactions generally reduce the dimensions of chiral primary
operators.

3.  The superconformal  satisfying  and  must
give a real, positive -charge to all chiral fields, otherwise we expect
that there is no RG fixed point SCFT.  
The outline of this paper is as follows.  In the next section we will
discuss some general aspects of currents, anomalies, and
supersymmetry.  After presenting some background material, 
we will argue for the result  by using a result due to Osborn: 
the 3-point
function of two stress tensor supermultiplets and one flavor current
supermultiplet is of a form completely determined by the
superconformal symmetry with only a single overall multiplicative
coefficient to be determined.  
The condition  will also be obtained, by relating the 't Hooft
anomalies to current-current correlators and using unitarity, as in
.  In section 3 we verify, in complete generality, that our
 maximization precisely reproduces the known, leading
order, anomalous dimensions in all perturbatively accessible RG fixed
points of the type conjectured by ,  .  

In section 4 we use  maximization to obtain the exact
R-charge for some previously mysterious examples.  In particular, 
we consider in complete generality theories with two different 
matter field representations and zero superpotential.  A special 
case of this is  with an adjoint chiral superfield and
 fundamental flavors, with .  This theory was argued to have 
a non-trivial RG fixed point in , and was further explored in 
, but the exact R-charges could not be determined
before the present paper.  We also discuss some chiral quiver  
SCFT examples,
both with and without superpotential, which gives another check of the
a-theorem.  

Currents, anomalies, and supersymmetry 

In this section we argue for the result  by showing that
a result due to Osborn  implies that 
and  are necessarily proportional to each other.  
 As we also discuss, following
, the  t'Hooft anomalies are proportional to the 
 current correlator, whose sign is constrained by
unitarity.  The reader need not get too bogged down with the numerical
coefficients in the following section, since we only need to establish
general proportionality relations.  The constants of proportionality
can then always be determined by considering the particular case of a
free field theory.

Review of currents and anomalies 

Let's first review some basics of currents and anomalies in theories
which aren't necessarily supersymmetric.  We'll call the gauge group
, and suppose, for illustrative purposes, that the flavor group is
a product , with left-handed chiral currents
 for .  (The generalization to non-Abelian flavor
symmetries is straightforward, with the most interesting aspects for
our discussions in the  factors anyway.)


The currents  must not have ABJ anomalies, i.e. the triangle
diagram with a current insertion at one vertex and  gauge fields
at the other two must vanish.  Suppose that there are  chiral
fermions , all in  representation , with
 flavor charge , which all run in the loop.  The vanishing
ABJ anomaly condition is   
_i q_i^I n_i (_i)=0, 
where the  are the
quadratic Casimirs from the coupling to the two  gauge fields,
_r _i  (T_^AT_^B)=
(r _i)^AB , 2h (Ad), 
and with  the  generators in representation .
The anomaly free condition  can
equivalently be stated as the condition that the fermion zero modes of
the  instanton's 't Hooft vertex must be flavor neutral.  The 
instanton has  of the  fermion
zero modes.  (Our normalization is e.g.  for .)

We now consider current correlators.  In any conformal field theory,
the current two-point functions are completely 
determined by conformal invariance, up to the overall coefficient:
J_^I(x)J_^K(0) =^IK  16 ^4 (
_^
_ - __)(1x^4 ). 
In any unitary theory,  should be a matrix with all
positive definite eigenvalues.

The form of the current 3-point functions are also highly constrained.
The aspect of interest to us here is the anomalous violation of the current
conservation in contact terms. 
For example,
z_ 
J^I_(x)J^I_(y) J^I_(z) =-k_III 
48^2 
_ x ^ 
y ^ (x-z)(y-z), 
where the coefficient  is the 't Hooft anomaly 
k_III = _i n_i _i (q_i^I)^3. 
Here  is the dimension of the representation .  

Similarly, there are current conservation
violating contact terms in current correlators involving mixtures of
the two currents, such as  
with , which
has an anomalous contact term proportional to the mixed 't Hooft anomaly
k_LLI U(1)_L^2U(1)_I =_i n_i _i 
q_i^I(q^L_i)^2. 
Another anomalous contact term, violating current conservation, occurs in the 
3-point functions involving the current at one vertex of the triangle diagram
and stress energy tensors at the other two, e.g. 
, which has anomalous contact terms proportional to the
't Hooft anomaly
k_IU(1)_I =_i n_i _iq^I_i 

The contact terms in the above mentioned three point functions can be
conveniently expressed in terms of a lack of current conservation when
the currents  are coupled to general background gauge fields
, and the stress tensor  is coupled to a general
metric .  For example, we have
z_  J^I_(z)=k_III 48^2  F_I F _I +
k_IIL  16^2  F_I F _L  +k_LLI 16^2  F_LF _L +k_I384^2  R R   where
, 
, and 

.
 The first term comes from the descent formalism on
.  On the other hand, the third term comes
directly from the index theorem, as in the ABJ anomaly, involving
; this is one way to understand the relative
factor of three between these two terms (one can also see it directly
from the symmetry factors with the two corresponding triangle
diagrams).  The last term in  is the Poyntryagin density; it
can be written in terms of the Weyl tensor (the Riemann tensor minus
all non-zero contractions of indices), 
so it vanishes in any conformally flat background.




Supersymmetric Theories 

Consider a general 4d  supersymmetric gauge theory, with
gauge group , which we'll take to be simple to streamline the
present discussion (the generalization to product gauge groups is
easy).  The theory has chiral superfields  in the  representation
(which, of course, must be gauge anomaly free): 
.  If there is no added superpotential, the
full symmetry group of anomaly free global symmetries is
U(1)_RU(1)^s-1 _i=1 ^s SU(n_s).   
(E.g. for
SQCD we have , with , ,
and .)

In the flavor group , we have already eliminated one 
classical global symmetry by the vanishing ABJ anomaly condition .
The chiral  symmetry in  assigns charge  to the gauginos,
charge  to the scalar components of the chiral superfields ,
and charge  to the fermion components of the chiral superfields;
thus the general condition  of vanishing ABJ anomaly becomes
2h+_i n_i (R_i-1)(_i) =0. 
The remaining flavor symmetries in  are not R-symmetries, so
the gauginos are neutral and all components of the chiral superfield
, in representation , carry the same charge .
According to , these must satisfy
_i n_i q_i (r _i)=0. 
The non-Abelian part of the currents in  is always anomaly
free since their generators are traceless, so  only constrains
the overall  flavor symmetries in , which commute with
the non-Abelian flavor symmetries. Any superpotential terms will further 
constrain the above flavor symmetries and charges, which could 
be easily incorporated into this discussion.

The anomalous contact terms in current three point functions or
equivalently the lack of current conservation when the global symmetries
are coupled to non-trivial backgrounds are as described in the previous
subsection, with the 't Hooft anomalies:
 R^3k_RRR &= + _i n_i
(R_i-1)^3_i  Rk_R&= + _i n_i(R_i-1)_i R^2 Fk_RRF &=_i n_i(R_i-1)^2 q_i_iF^3k_FFF &=_i n_iq_i^3 _i Fk_F&=_i n_iq_i _i RF^2k_RFF &=_i n_i(R_i-1)q_i^2 _i.  
 is the dimension of the gauge group, and  is that of .  

The flavor currents and their anomalies in general backgrounds can be
expressed in terms of current super-fields.  One is the super-stress
tensor , whose
 component is the superconformal  symmetry,
components linear in  and 
 are the supersymmetry currents, and terms quadratic in the
 and  are the stress-energy tensor.  The
other, non-R, flavor currents reside in current superfields 
J_I(x,
)= 14 T_I , with current component J_I ^=^_
  
[ ^,   ^ ] J_I _=0 . 
Here  and 
are the chiral and anti-chiral matter fields and  is the appropriate
flavor generator, labeled by .  
The super-stress tensor
 couples to the metric in terms of the 
metric superfield , while the non-R current superfields
 couple to background superfield vector multiplets .  See 
 for the notational background. 

The super-stress tensor's anomaly can be expressed in the general
form
  ^ T_ =
 _L_T, 
where  is the trace-anomaly, which can be written in terms of the
variation of the action with respect to the chiral compensator superfield of
supergravity. For example, in a theory with non-vanishing beta function we'd
have 
, giving ,
with  the gauge field strength and  its chiral superfield.
We're interested in conformal field theories, so  and
 when in flat space and trivial background gauge fields.  When
coupled to non-trivial backgrounds, however, we have
L_T=c 24 ^2 ^2 -a 24 ^2 
-196^2 _IK _IK W_I W_K. 
The coefficients  and  are the central charges
 
is the square of the super-Weyl tensor, and 
 is the chirally projected
super Euler density; see appendix A of  for a discussion of these
terms.  Taking components of the first two terms in  
is how  obtained the relations .  The remaining terms in 
are the contributions to the scaling anomaly proportional to the super
field strengths  of the background gauge fields , which couple
to the flavor supercurrents .  The coefficients  are the same
as those in , following the discussion in .

The flavor super-anomaly 

We now turn to the anomaly of the non-R flavor currents  in
general backgrounds.  The divergence of the current in  is
proportional to , so the super-anomaly
can be written as a non-zero chiral contribution to .
We were not able
to find a discussion of this in the literature or supersymmetry
textbooks so, as far as we're aware, our result of 
 in a general background is new.  It's clear
how to proceed: since  is a chiral object, its non-zero
anomaly must involve chiral field strengths of the background fields.
Further, the current anomaly component of the result must reproduce the
terms in .  The result is
D ^2 J_I= k_III  48 ^2  W _I^2+ 
_L I ( k_IIL  16 ^2 
W_IW_L + k_ILL  16 ^2  W_LW_L)+k_I 384^2  ^2. 

The crucial aspect of
 for our purposes is that the gravitational contribution only
involves , with no additional term proportional to the chiral
Euler/Poyntryagin density .  This differs from the super-stress
tensor anomaly , which involves both chiral field strengths.  To
motivate the absence of an additional term proportional to  in
, we note that  has a component which is the Euler
density, which is non-vanishing even for a conformally flat metric.
On the other hand,  does vanish in a conformally flat background.
The absence of a term proportional to  in  is related
to the fact that supercurrents should be conserved in a conformally flat
background, since there is no
unavoidable charge violation by particle production in conformally flat 
backgrounds.  For example, in conformally flat AdS space,
with unbroken supersymmetry, the  component of  is conserved
because the Poyntryagin density vanishes.  Supersymmetry then implies
that the holomorphic quantity  identically vanishes.

The gravitational part of  can equivalently be described in
terms of an anomalous contribution to the current super-field 3-point
function D ^2_3 T_ (1)T_ (2) J_I(3) =contact terms ,  where
 etc. label the superspace coordinates at the three points.  The
fact that there is only one independent gravitational term in
, as opposed to the two terms in , is related to a result
of Osborn  for the relevant 3-point function:
T_ (1)T_ (2)
J_I(3) =K_I I_,  (1,2,3).   Here
 is a completely
determined function on superspace , and the only dependence on the
theory is in a single overall coefficient .  Taking  of
 gives the contact terms indicated in .  This would
then leadRather than
directly showing that the contact terms indeed lead to , we
note that, because the function 
 in  is completely determined, the possible
gravitational contributions to , namely  and
, must appear with a fixed ratio.  Then a free-field calculation
would suffice to show that the coefficient of  is actually zero,
as in .   to , with the single overall normalization constant
, needed to fix the three-point function , thus
proportional to the  't Hooft anomaly .  


In contrast, it was also shown in  that the  3-point function
depends on two overall coefficients, which is related to the fact 
that both  and  appear in .  
The fact that the 3-point function involving two stress tensors and
one flavor current 
 is completely fixed up to a single
overall normalization coefficient also holds in non-supersymmetric
conformal field theories, as shown by .  There, too, we can say that
the single undetermined overall coefficient must be proportional to the
 't Hooft anomaly.  


Why  is maximized for the correct superconformal 
 symmetry 

In this section we prove  and , from which 
maximization follows.

Consider , with the background gauge fields  set to 
zero and only the non-trivial backgrounds those in , namely
the metric and the 
background gauge field strength, which we denote by .  
The divergence of the  flavor current is 

^J^I_&=-i4 [ ^2 , ^2 ]J_I_=0 =
ik_I 384^2  ( ^2^2 -  ^2
^2)_=0 &=-k_I 384^2  (R
R  + 8 3  F_R F _R ).    Comparing with
, the first term is the expected result involving the anomaly
proportional to the  't Hooft anomaly multiplied by
the Poyntryagin density.  The second term in  is the anomaly
which, as in , should be proportional to the 
 't Hooft
anomaly, but we see in  that it's instead also proportional to
.  Taking into account the coefficients in , as compared
with , we have thus shown the result .  As a check of
eqns.   and , we note that  suffices to show that
the ratio  is some fixed number for all currents,
independent of the theory; so it can be evaluated for the case of free
fields, where the matter fermions have , showing that the
ratio is 9.  We can write the result  as
_i n_i _i q_i (9(R_i-1)^2-1) =0. 

To prove , suppose that we take trivial metric and 
backgrounds but turn on background gauge fields coupled to the
currents .  Then  and  imply, as in
,  that the  symmetry
has a divergence given by
_R^= -_IJ 48^2  
F_I F_J, and hence k_RIJ U(1)_RU(1)_IU(1)_J=
-_IJ  3  ,  where  are the same coefficients
as in .  Since  must be a matrix with all positive
definite eigenvalues in any unitary theory, we see that supersymmetry,
along with unitarity, requires  to be
negative, as in . It is easy to see this in for example a free
field theory, where the R-charge of any matter fermion field is
.

A check: comparing with perturbative RG fixed points. 

Let's write the beta function as:
(g)=-_1 g^3+_2 g^5 +. 
As pointed out in , , there can be a RG fixed point in the
perturbative regime if the one loop beta function is negative and the two
loop beta function positive, so  and  in 
are both positive, and the coupling  where
they cancel is sufficiently small.  The expectation is that, in this
case, higher order corrections might shift the fixed point value 
a bit, but not wipe out the qualitative feature of a RG fixed point.
This is the case when  is very small, so the theory is just
barely asymptotically free.  In terms of a large  expansion,
where  is order  and  is order 
(corresponding to the expansion in 't Hooft coupling ) we get
a small  by adding matter flavors with total quadratic index
 proportional to , to make  order .  The
 is still order , so we get : the
't Hooft coupling is parametrically small, so the existence of the
RG fixed point is on fairly solid ground. 

We will be completely general, letting the gauge group be  and
there be matter chiral superfields in representations 
.  To be in the perturbative RG fixed point 
regime, we want to have
_1 = 3h-_T h , 
with 0<1, 
and  the total of the matter
field's quadratic Casimirs .  We first compute the
superconformal  symmetry via  maximization, and
then compare the result to a direct perturbative computation of the
anomalous dimensions at the RG fixed point.

We assign the fields R-charge  subject to the vanishing anomaly
constraint ; to order  we do this as
R_i = 23 +R_i^(1) + O(^2), 
where _i n_i (_i)R^(1) _i =-23 h. 
We now compute
9R^2F-F= -6_i R^(1) _in_i _i q_i
+O(^2);  this must vanish for the superconformal .
This vanishing must hold for all possible choices of flavor charges
 which satisfy the anomaly free condition .
This requires that , and we can fix
the overall normalization  via to obtain
R_i=23 -2h3 (_j n_j 
(_j)^2_j^-1 )^-1 (_i)_i +
O(^2).   

Of course, we could just as well obtain the
exact answer via  maximization, but the result will be
complicated, and we're only interested here in comparing the
order  term to a perturbative computation.  

We now check that the result  agrees with an explicit perturbative 
computation of the anomalous dimension, using
R_i=23 _i = 23 (1+_i (g_*)), 
with  the anomalous dimensions, evaluated at
the RG fixed point coupling  where .  Working
to one-loop, which corresponds to order , we have
_i (g)=-g^28^2   (_i) _i
 +O(g^4). 
This can be seen by considering the matter field propagator, with 
a single gluon (plus gluino) loop.  The group theory factor comes
 from the sum over gluons
coupling to the matter field in representation : 

_a=1 ^ 
T^a__i T^a__i =(_i)_i 1 _ _i_i ,  with  the  generators in
 representation , with  the adjoint index.  The group theory
 factors in  are seen by comparing the trace of
 with .   

The RG fixed point coupling  is determined by requiring that
the NSVZ beta function vanish, which is equivalent to the condition
that the  symmetry  satisfy the anomaly free condition 
, i.e.
2h+_i n_i(_i) (-13 -g_*^216^2 
(_i) _i^-1 )+O(g_*^4)=0, 
which gives
g_*^2 8^2 =(6h-_T)(_j n_i (_j)^2
_j^-1 )^-1 . 
Recalling that , we see that
, together with  and  indeed agree with 
.  It would be interesting to compare higher orders
in , where our exact results make predictions about the
higher loop anomalous dimensions.

Some previously mysterious examples 

General case where  mixes with a single flavor . 

In this section, we will explicitly determine the superconformal  
for cases where there is a single flavor current  which can mix
non-trivially with .  This is the case, for example, for theories
with two types of representations (e.g.  
with  fundamental flavors and an adjoint chiral superfield) and .  

 maximization leads to the  as given by
R=R_0+s J, 
where using  we have that  is determined by 
s^2 J^3+2s 
R_0 J^2+ R_0^2 J -19 J =0. 
This quadratic equation can be solved, with the correct root for
maximizing , i.e. satisfying , given by
s =  -R_0 J^2 - 
(R_0 J^2)^2-J^3(R_0^2J-19 
J)  J^3 . 
Of course  must be real, so the quantity in the  must be
positive.  

Let's apply this to a general theory with two kinds of matter representations
and .  
Consider a theory with gauge group ,  matter fields in
representation  and  matter fields in representation
.   We can take our initial  to be one under which all chiral superfields
have the same charge, with value determined from , and choose
our current  to be one satisfying , then 
 is 
R (_1)=1-2h_T +s n_1 (_1) , 
R(_2)= 1-2h_T -sn_2 (_2) , 
where .  The value of  
 is found by just plugging into  with 
R_0 J^2&=-2h_T (
_1n_1(_1)^2 +
_2n_2 (_2)^2 ) R_0^2J-19 J&=(4h^2_T^2 
-19 )( _1(_1) -_2(_2) ) J^3&=_1n_1^2(_1)^3 -_2n_2^2 (_2)^3 .  
Asymptotic freedom, , is sufficient to ensure that , 
as given by , is indeed real.  We'll now check that the R-charges are
positive in a specific example.

This general discussion can be applied, e.g. to the case
of  with  fundamental flavors and an adjoint 
chiral superfield.   We 
just  plug in  (counting fundamentals and anti-fundamentals together,
since they have the same R-charge, as in comment 1 in the introduction),
, , , , .
This yields 


where  is determined by  with 






As an example, we consider the case of , with fixed 
.
We then get, to leading order in , ,
which gives


These are indeed positive, and  satisfies the  constraint needed for
fields transforming non-trivially under non-Abelian flavor symmetries, as mentioned in 
comment 1 of the introduction.  There are gauge invariant operators, such as
 and  which apparently violate the 
constraint but, as mentioned in footnote 2, this just means that these particular operators
are actually free, and their R-charge gets corrected to  by additional accidental
symmetries.  (A similar situation occurs when these theories are deformed by 
a  superpotential . )  

A quiver example and connection to AdS/CFT 

As an interesting example of a theory with more than one flavor
current, we consider the theory given by the quiver in Figure 1 with
gauge group . This quiver arises naturally in string theory as
the IR worldvolume theory of  coincident
D3-branes placed at the tip of a noncompact Calabi-Yau  , where
 is a
complex cone over the first del Pezzo surface .  This string
theory construction leads to a non-zero superpotential, and the
large  limit of that theory is an  SCFT which is dual to IIB
string theory on  with  the horizon of the
complex cone over . This  is a  fibration over .  We
will discuss this SCFT, for all , shortly.

First, let's consider the theory with the quiver diagram of Fig 1 and with
no superpotential, .  This theory has no known string theory construction
and is hence more mysterious than the theory with non-zero .  We 
expect that the  theory also flows to an interacting  SCFT
in the IR, and we use the  maximization to determine the exact
 charges and hence the exact anomalous dimensions and 
central charges at this new RG fixed point.  
quiver2.eps  
Figure 1: 
The  quiver diagram.  
The IR SCFT has symmetry group , with flavor group
.
The non-Abelian symmetries rotate the multiple bi-fundamental flavors
and classically there's an additional flavor , 
one for each of the six legs of the quiver.  Enforcing the anomaly free 
condition for each of the four gauge
groups reduces this  down to .  As
discussed in the introduction,  maximization implies that
only the  can mix non-trivially with .  Without loss
of generality, we can assign  charges as:
  &J_1&J_2&R_0 X_21 & -2/3& -1/3& 3/4 X_14 & 1& 0&1/2 X_43 & -2& -1& 1/4 X_32 & 1& 0& 1/2 X_13 & 0&1&3/4 X_42 &0&1& 3/4.    These charges form a basis
of the solutions of the appropriate anomaly-free conditions at each
node.  (Of course, any non-degenerate linear combinations of these
would be an equally valid basis choice.)  For completeness we include
all relevant 't Hooft anomalies here (omitting an overall factor of
 for each): 




  



We write the exact superconformal  symmetry as 
, and determine the values
of  by imposing , for , and
use  to determine the correct roots of the resulting quadratic
equations; the result is 
 and 
.  We thus obtain for the
exact R-charges
R(X_21 )&=7-5 6 , R(X_14 )=R(X_32 )=
1+5 6 ,
R(X_43 )&=3-5 2 , R(X_13 )=R(X_42 )=1+5 6 .    It's a good consistency on
the existence of this interacting RG fixed point that all of the
R-charges  are indeed positive, and satisfy the condition 
needed, as mentioned in the introduction, to ensure .  Further, the
 charge of all gauge invariant chiral operators, such as
, satisfy the condition .

The value of the central charge , found by plugging 
into  is 
a=3+55 16 N^2 0.886 N^2. 

One final comment on our proposed RG fixed point for the  theory.
Some of the nodes of the quiver have , and are thus not
asymptotically free (the one loop beta function vanishes, and the two
loop beta function is positive).  Their gauge couplings would flow to zero
in the IR, in the absence of other
interactions.  Our claim is that, upon including the gauge interactions of
the other nodes, the theory flows to an IR fixed point SCFT, where all
gauge groups are interacting.  The NSVZ beta function for each gauge
group vanishes, since  is anomaly free.  
We have not proven that the fixed point exists, since we haven't proven that
the dynamics can actually realize the R-charges , but the various 
consistency checks give us confidence that
the fixed point SCFT exists.

Let's now consider the theory with the non-trivial superpotential, as obtained
via  branes at the singularity of a local CY which is a complex cone 
over :
W=X_21 X_14 X_42  +
X_21 X_13 X_32  + X_21 X_14 X_43 X_32 .   Since we only care
about the symmetries, we've suppressed the coefficients and flavor
indices; see 

B. Feng, S. Franco, A. Hanany and Y. H. He,
"Symmetries of toric duality,"
JHEP 0212 , 076 (2002)
[arXiv:hep-th/0205144].

  for the precise superpotential.  We can think of the resulting SCFT as
the IR limit of a RG flow, where the UV limit of the RG flow 
is the above described  SCFT, deformed by the relevant 
perturbation .  We now obtain the exact R-charges of this
IR SCFT.  

 
The superpotential  reduces the  flavor symmetry of the  theory
to : the superpotential respects the  symmetry in  (since
all terms in the superpotential have R-charge 2)
but is only neutral under .  So rather than maximizing 
with respect to  and  independently, as before, we now maximize
subject to the constraint that .  We can impose  
by simply plugging into , which gives .   Thus
the  charges in  are the exact R-charges for the theory with
superpotential .  
Using these charges,
one finds . This is less than the value  
which we found in the  case, which is consistent with the a-theorem.

String theory gives another way to determine the exact central charge
, and also the exact R-charges, in terms of the  geometry.
In particular, the baryonic operators such as 
correspond to particles in , which arise from D3 branes wrapped
on 3-cycles of .    
The R-charges of the baryons, and hence the bi-fundamentals,
are then related to the volume of the  3-cycles which the D3 wraps.  
This can be computed and shown to agree perfectly with the above results
