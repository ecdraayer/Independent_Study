In this article we construct the chirality and 
Dirac operators on noncommutative .     
We also derive the discrete spectrum of the Dirac operator which  is 
important in the study of the spectral triple associated to . It is shown that 
the degeneracy of the spectrum present in the commutative  is lifted 
in the noncommutative case. The way we construct the 
chirality operator is suggestive of how to introduce the projector operators 
of the corresponding projective modules on this space. 


Introduction 
Recently there has been much interest in applying the  Connes spectral triple approach to 
the study of  noncommutative manifolds such as fuzzy sphere and noncommutative  
. 
In this approach one starts with an algebra  (say the algebra of functions 
on the underlying manifold ), a Hilbert space  which is a representation of , 
and a Dirac operator  which acts on . Having the triple 
, the geometry and topology of  can be determined. 
For example, the distance formula is given in terms of , and knowing the spectrum 
of , allows one to do the integration over .   

Fuzzy sphere is the simplest example of a curved 
noncommutative manifold for which the 
spectral triple has been explicitly worked out. 
Another two dimensional and non-flat example that comes to mind is the fuzzy  (noncommutative) .  
Fuzzy  naturally appears  
in the study of a variant form of (noncommutative) AdS/CFT 
correspondence in two dimensions. 
Note that the isometry group of  is , 
and to get the fuzzy version of , one 
promotes the coordinates defining the embedding of the surface in  
from ordinary functions to the generators of the group . The embedding and the 
algebra satisfied by the coordinates are invariant under the automorphism group   of the algebra and hence the name 
fuzzy . 

For fuzzy sphere, a knowledge of the Dirac operator and its spectrum has allowed 
the authors of to 
compute the Chern numbers of the associated 
projective module  on fuzzy sphere.  
Here we will follow  to construct the Dirac operator on fuzzy 
, and derive its discrete spectrum. 
In particular, we will find that the discrete spectrum of  is nondegenerate. This should be contrasted with the commutative  case where the discrete spectrum of  is degenerate.  By this, we provide the spectral triple of fuzzy 
. One may wish to build modules on this space, and, for instance, study 
the Yang-Mills theory on it. We introduce one such projective modules by constructing its 
corresponding projector on the fuzzy . To compute the Chern number of these 
modules, however, one has to adapt the Connes formula to the case of noncompact algebras. 

In the context of supersymmetric quantum mechanics on , 
in the spectrum of the Dirac operator, and the corresponding spinors for 
a charged particle with 
spin  - in the presence of a magnetic monopole -   
was successfully derived. There it was shown that the Dirac
spinors represent an  chiral supersymmetry algebra and a unitary 
parasupersymmetry algebra of an arbitrary order. Along the lines of,  
it is interesting to see how 
these results are modified on fuzzy . This is one of our 
motivations to study the Dirac operator on fuzzy . 


-pseudo-Hermiticity and    

In this section we study a special representation for the Lie algebra . 
This we choose to be a non-unitary representation given by  matrices. 
In this representation, the 
-pseudo-Hermiticity - which will be defined shortly - structure of the 
algebra is very clear. 
Then we will introduce an appropriate inner product between the elements of 
the Hilbert space on which  acts. This will induce the -pseudo-Hermiticity 
structure of the algebra on to the Hilbert space. 
The -pseudo-Hermiticity concept will become important when we come to 
discuss the spectrum of the Dirac operator on fuzzy .
   
For every irreducible unitary finite dimensional representation of
the compact semisimple Lie group , one can analytically continue 
the representation to a finite dimensional necessarily non-unitary representation of
the noncompact semisimple Lie group . Both Lie groups  and  have a common maximal compact subgroup
, and a common complexification which is the 
Lie group . 
Considering the lowest dimensional irreducible
representation of the Lie algebra , which is represented by the
Pauli matrices ,  and , one can construct a two
dimensional non-unitary representation of the Lie algebra 

_1 =i _1
_2=i _2  _3=_3  . 
It is straightforward to show that 
_i
_j=-_ij I + i C_ij ^  k  _k  ,  

where the
indices are raised and lowered by . The
structure constants 's are completely anti-symmetric in
their indices, and our convention is . 
If we parametrize the Lie group   of  matrices
of unit determinant as , they will 
satisfy the following -pseudo-unitary 
relation 

U^ _3U=U_3U^ =_3  . 
In the next section, we will see how this property of -pseudo-Hermiticity 
gets extended to the Dirac operator on noncommutative .
The relation () induces essentially the property of
-self-adjoint on  representation of the Lie algebra 
_i^ =_3 _i _3    ,

where we note that the operator  is self-adjoint, involutory and unitary 

_3^ =_3
 _3^2 =I 
_3^-1 =_3^    . 

Therefore, the Lie algebra space
 is said to be pseudo-Hermitian with respect to  (or
equivalently, we say  is -pseudo-Hermitian). The eigenvalues of
-pseudo-Hermitian operators are known to be either real or
appear  in complex-conjugates pairs. 
Let the linear operator  be an arbitrary element
of the Lie algebra  acting on a separable Hilbert space
.  is expressed as a linear combination of the
traceless  matrices ,  and  with
real determinants. 
If we define the -adjoint for
every  belonging to the Hilbert space  as 
 =^ _3  , 

then we can introduce a 
natural indefinite inner product "" of the two arbitrary elements
 and  belonging to the Hilbert space , as 
   . 

This  has the
following property for every arbitrary element  of the Lie algebra  
(u)=
 u _3u u^ _3=(u)^ _3(u)   , 

which means that all the generators belonging to  are
-pseudo-Hermitian with respect to the inner product "". 
A Hilbert space equipped with such an indefinite inner product
is called the Krein space. Using Eq. () the Lie and Clifford
algebras corresponding to the generators  are obtained, 
respectively as  
&&[_i , _j]= 2i C_ij ^  k  _k  

&&_i , _j= -2 _ij  I  . It is straightforward to show that the structure constants 
satisfy the following relation 
C_im ^   k  ^ij  C_jl ^  n =_m ^  n _l ^ k 
- _ml  ^kn .  
Next let us discuss the geometrical structure of the Euclidean . 
The Euclidean 
is defined through the following embedding in 3-dimensional flat Minkowskian space
 ()
x x :=x_i^ij x_j=-l^2  . This could also be thought of as the poincare upper half-plane  with
the Riemannian metric
ds^2=l^2 dx^2+dy^2 y^2  .If we make the following coordinates transformations 
x=2 2   1+2 2 
+^2 2   
y=1-^2 2  1+2 2 
+^2 2   ,
the metric () will transform to 
ds^2 =l^2 (d^2 + ^2 d^2 ) . The above metric can also be obtained by simply inserting the 
embedding coordinates
&& x_1= l
 && x_2 =l
 
&& x_3=l
into the Minkowskian metric 
ds^2=dx_1^2 +dx_2^2 -dx_3^2 .
Also note that the metric () has a negative scalar curvature . 


  principal fiber bundles over  

For the sake of completeness, here we discuss the Hopf construction of 
the  bundles over . This will prove useful in the 
discussion of the noncommutative analogue of bundles over , i.e., 
the construction of projective modules over fuzzy . 
 
The  principal fiberation  of the total space 
over  can be realized as follows. First we define the total space 
in  through the embedding 
AdS_3=(z_1,z_2)C1 ^2 ,  z_1^2
-z_2^2=-l^2 . In the framework of principal fiber bundle, this is projected over the base manifold 
 as 
U(1)right  U(1)-action    AdS_3
   AdS_2 .
The right -action transforms the point 
of  onto another point of  
 
The complex Hopf bundle projection  is given by 
&&x_1=1 l (z_1z _2+z_2z _1) 

&&x_2=i l (z_1z _2-z_2z _1)  

&&x_3=1 l (z_1^2+z_2^2) .
The relation () can be directly checked. The sections of this  
bundle over the base manifold  are then the inverse of 
(), i.e.,
z_1^2 =l 2 (x_3-l)
z_2^2 =l 2 (x_3+l)
z_1z _2=l 2 (x_1-ix_2).
Moreover, the Hopf fibration of  bundles over  can also be expressed 
in the group theoretical framework as follows.   
There is a canonical one-to-one correspondence between the points on  and 
the elements of , . 
It is sufficient to choose the one-to-one map 
as 
 
in which  and  are arbitrary elements of . It is easy to
check that it has the unit determinant, and also, satisfies -pseudo-unitary
relation (). The homogeneous manifold  can be obtained by
the Hopf projection as 
 
where the coordinates  (for homogeneous manifold )
are obtained from the complex coordinates  and 
(for the group manifold ) via Eqs. ().
The right -action over  keeps the base point 
fixed in the sence that all the elements
 of  are projected
onto the same point  on the base manifold
. Therefore, we can identify any equivalance class

with the point  via the projection map ().

Noncommutative  and finite dimensional Schwinger representation 
of the algebra  

As mentioned in introduction, to define the fuzzy , we promote the 
coordinates 's of  to play the role of the generators of 
, in some unitary representation. For a given integer  (), 
let (,) denote the space of all analytic functions 
of coordinates, and derivations on fuzzy , respectively. As in the 
case of fuzzy sphere we can work out a Schwinger representation for .   
To start with, introduce a real parameter 
 controling the strength of the noncommutativity, and take the coordinates 's 
to satisfy the relation
[x_i , x_j]= iC_ij ^  k  x_k  , such that 's satisfy the commutation relations of the Lie algebra .
Like , the Lie group  is a group of rank , and so possesses one invariant
Casimir operator whose eigenvalues label the irreducible representations.
The noncommutative relation () together with the embedding (), 
which now ascribes a negative constant
value to the Casimir operator, defines the noncommutative
. In fact, this is an analytic continuation of the noncommutative structure of the fuzzy sphere to that of  via the metric .  
The passage from the fuzzy sphere to the noncommutative 
is equivalent analytically to the passage from the ordinary Euclidean Clifford algebra 
to the Minkowskian Clifford algebra. 

The generators  of  are defined by the adjoint action of 
 on the space :
1  ad_x_i x_j=1  [x_i,x_j]=:L_ix_j .
This induces the commutation relations of the Lie algebra  on  
[L_i , L_j]= i C_ij ^  k  L_k  . The bigger algebra ( , ) includes the commutation relations
() and  (), as well as
[L_i , x_j]= i C_ij ^  k  x_k  .  We are now going to introduce a version of the Schwinger operator bases which realizes a representation of the Lie algebra  using the -pseudo-Hermitian matrices (). In this formulation, one considers the elements of 
acting on a finite dimensional Hilbert space  spanned by a set of 
orthonormal bases .
Then, the algebra  can be identified with the algebra of 
 complex matrices, which act on an -dimensional Hilbert space
. According to the discussion above, the Hilbert space  can be constructed by acting a pair of creation and annihilation operators  and  
(, ) on the vacuum state , i.e.,
k1 k!(N-2-k)!  (a ^  _1 )^k
(a ^  _2 )^N-2-k 0 k=0,1, 
,N-2  ,

where the commutation relations are
[a ^a  , a ^b ]=[a ^  _a  , 
a ^  _b ]=0 
[a ^a  , 
a ^  _b ]=^a_b  .
The number operator 
 has the eigenvalue  over 
the Hilbert space  
N __F _N  =N-2 .
The Schwinger representation for the bases of the algebra  is now represented
as follows
x_i=1 2 (_i )^a_  b  a ^  _a  
a ^b . It is straightforward to see that the generators () satisfy the algebra of noncommutative  (), as well as the following commutation relations:
[x_i , a ^  _a ]=1 2 (_i )^b_  a  a ^  _b  

[x_i , a ^a ]=-1 2 (_i )^a_ b  
a ^b  .
The Casimir operator of the generators () is  
x x =-^2 4  N (N +2) . Restricting the equations over the Hilbert space , and 
comparing Eq. () with (), we conclude that
2l N(N-2)    , which implies that 
the commutative limit  corresponds to the limit 
.


Chirality and Dirac operators 

Our aim in this section is to construct the Dirac operator on 
fuzzy . This is the most important ingredient in the 
Connes construction of noncommutative manifolds.  
To define the Dirac operator, however, first we need to introduce the 
chirality operator . The existence of this latter operator provides a 
 grading of the Hilbert space .  has the following properties:

 

 Commutes with the elements of the algebra , and squares to one.



 Has a standard commutative limit.

This chirality operator, however, instead of being Hermitian as in 
the case of 
compact algebras, turns out to be -pseudo-Hermitian on fuzzy .
The Dirac operator  is then constructed such that: 



 It anticommutes with . 



 Reduces to the conventional Dirac operator on commutative , when 
the noncommutativity parameter  is sent to zero. 
Notice that the above requirements on  and  do not uniquely fix their representations. 
Let us represent the Dirac and chirality operators by the -component spinors 
 as the elements of 
-bimodule . 

Following, to construct , we introduce the
opposite algebra  with the product rule between the elements
x_i^0 x_j^0 (x_j x_i)^0  .
In other words, the generators , which form the opposite algebra , 
are acting from 
the right hand side on -bimodule:
x_i^0 x_i  H . 
From these, we obtain the commutation relation of this algebra to be
[x_i^0 , x_j^0]= -iC_ij ^  k  x_k^0  . Now let us define the chirality operator to be
=1 N _N (_i ^ij x_j^0 + 2 I) ,
where 
N _N =l^2+^2 4    
=l(N-1) N(N-2)  . 
It is easy to check that  is involutory, just note that
(_i ^ij x_j^0)(_k ^kl x_l^0) &=& 
^ij ^kl (-_ik I +iC_ik ^  n _n)x^0_jx^0_l 

&=& -^jl x^0_jx^0_l I +iC^jln _nx^0_jx^0_l 

&=& l^2I + 2 C^jln C_jl ^  r _nx^0_r 

&=& l^2I -^nr _nx^0_r  ,

so 
^2 = 1 N _N^2 (^2 4 I +_i^ij x^0_j +l^2I 
-_i^ij x^0_j)=I .Note that the chirality operator  is constructed so 
that it commutes with the elements of
algebra . Moreover, since , 
it is -pseudo-Hermitian
^ =_3 _3 . Next we introduce the Dirac operator
D=-i l  C_ij ^  k ^il ^jm _lx^0_m x_k . In the following we show that  anticommutes with . 
First note that
(^ij _ix_j^0)(_lx_k^0)=^ij _i_l x_j^0x_k^0 &=& 
^ij (-_l_i -2_il I)(x^0_kx^0_j -i
C_jk ^  r x_r^0) 

&=& -(_lx^0_k)(^ij _ix^0_j) +i^ij C_jk ^  
r _l_ix^0_r 
-2x^0_lx^0_k I  ,

where in the first line we have used Eq. (), and 
the relation 
(). So we learn that
 C_ij ^  k ^il ^jm _l x_m^0  , ^ij _ix^0_j 
 &=& 
iC_ij ^  k C_sm ^  p ^il ^jm ^rs _l_r 
x^0_p 
-2 C_ij ^  k ^il ^jm x^0_lx^0_m I

&=& -C_ij ^  k ^il C_lr ^  n ^jm ^rs C_sm ^ 
 p  _n x^0_p

&=& -^nm ^ks  C_sm ^  p  _nx^0_p 

&=& -^ni ^pj C_ij ^  k _n x^0_p  .
The second and the third equality follow from Eqs. () and (). 
Since  and  commute with each other, we conclude that
D ,  &=& -i lN _N 
C_ij ^  k ^il ^jm _l x_m^0 x_k , 
^ij _ix^0_j  +
 N _N D 

&=& i lN _N C_ij ^  k ^il ^jm _lx^0_m 
x_k+ N _N  D

&=& 0  .Further, Eq. () implies that
D^= _3 D _3  , 
so it is -pseudo-Hermitian.

To proceed further and to discuss the commutative limit of the Dirac operator, 
there are some definitions and algebra among the operators in  that should be discussed.  
The commutation relations (), () and also 
[L_i , x_j^0]= i C_ij ^  k  x_k^0   which is obtained from Eqs. () and (), define the algebra  
 for the noncommutative .
Note that the generators of the algebra  can also be written as a linear combination of the generators of the algebras  and  as 
L_i = ^-1 (x_i - x_i^0). Introduce the following operators in  
 
&&:=x_i ^ij  _j 

&&:=L_i ^ij  _j 

&&:=-i C_ij ^  k  ^il  ^jm x_l L_m _k  ,
which are invariant under the  transformations.(Using the commutation relations of the algebra ,  
the (anti)commutation relations of the operators ,
 and  are

Using Eq. (), one can easily show that 
^ &=&_3 _3      

^ &=&_3 _3     

^ &=&-_3(+2)  _3  .   
If we define(Note that the generators 
 are -pseudo-Hermitian with respect 
to the inner product "" defined in the -bimodule 
, because






 
Also note that the generators 
, which like the bases of  
 and , constitute the Lie algebra , satisfy the 
following commutation relations


) 
J_i=L_i+1 2  _i   ,
and
_i=C_ij ^  k  ^jl  x_l _k 
then, using Eqs. (), () and (), it follows that
C_ij ^  k  ^il  ^jm  _l x_m^0 x_k= -  J 
=i (+ )  .  Therefore the Dirac operator 
can be written in the following compact forms
D=i l   J =1 l  
(+ )  .In this form the -pseudo-Hermiticity relation () can easily be 
derived from the second equality in () upon taking its dagger and using Eqs. 
(), (), (), () and (). 

Now let us discuss the status of the Casimir operators in . Unlike 
the commutative case where the only Casimir is , here we get 
an additional Casimir operator. Though, it will  
scale to zero in the commutative limit . 
First of all, it is clear that the operator 
, the Casimir operator of the 
bases of the algebra , satisfies the following relation 
[L_i , L L ]=0  .On the other hand, from the commutation relations ()
and (), one obtains
[L_i , x L ]=0   ,   giving the second Casimir mentioned above. If we define 
the generalized momentum operators
P_i=-i C_ij ^  k  ^jl  x_l L_k  ,   which are invariant under the  group transformations, 
we can obtain the following relations in the algebra 
 
&&[x_i , L L ]=2 (x_i+ P_i)   

&&[x_i , x L ]=(x_i+ P_i).  And finally, one can obtain
the action of both operators  and 
on the polynomials in the 
algebra  using the inductive procedure 
&&L L (x_i)^n= -2 n (x_i)^n      

&&x L (x_i)^n= - n (x_i)^n .  
Comparing Eqs. () and (), () and
(), and also, ()  and (), it is readily
found that
x L = 2  L L   ,   which shows that the commutative limit is reached when . 
 
We notice that in the commutative limit  
( or  ), the generators of the opposite algebra, 's, 
get transformed into the generators of , i.e. 
's. Therefore, using Eqs. () and () we get
D_ =-(1 l^2 x L  . However, taking into account the relation (), the second term of  also vanishes, and we are left with
D_ =-(, which is in agreement with the results of.
Therefore Dirac operator () 
reduces to the conventional Dirac operator on
commutative  when
the noncommutativity parameter  is sent to zero. 



Before concluding this section, let us briefly discuss the related subject of 
projective modules on fuzzy . Projective modules are analogue of fiber 
bundles on noncommutative spaces. So if we are to study, for instance, the Yang-Mills 
theory on noncommutative spaces, the concept of projective modules becomes 
indispensable. 
To construct a projective module, of a rank say 2, we proceed as follows. 
First we introduce a projector , which is a 22 matrix 
with elements in the algebra . This, in turn, allows us to 
define the projective 
module  of sections  such that . 
The connection 
 on  
is then a map from sections to one-form valued sections in . 

From what we did in the case of chirality operator , which squares 
to , it is not difficult to guess the form of . We define
p=1 2 (I+) ,where
=1 N _N ( _i ^ij x_j- 2 I) ,
such that , therefore  and  is a projector.
Note that in the above, 's are again the 2-dimensional 
representations of the  generators such that 
. Now, as mentioned earlier,  
defines the projective module  over  with 
the sections  such that .
Let us introduce the differential operator  through
du=i[D , u] ,

for any  in the Lie algeba of . If  is a section of the 
projective module  then , and we define the connection 
on  to be . Therefore the curvature of  is 
 with the first Chern class of 
C_1(p)=(pdp^2) .For compact algebras, the first Chern number of  is then calculated by 
taking the Dixmier trace over the Hilbert space . The formula for the 
first Chern number isc_1(p)=-Tr  _w (1 D^2   p [D,p][D,p] ) ,where . For the projective module defined by the 
projector (), it is straightforward to compute the first Chern class 
defined in (). But to calculate the first Chern number and to see whether 
the associated module is nontrivial needs a modification of the Connes formula 
() to the case of noncompact algebras. This is a problem that we would like 
to further study in future works.  


The discrete spectrum of Dirac operator on noncommutative  

In order to analyze the spectrum of the Dirac operator on noncommutative ,
first note that using Eqs. () and () we can write 
X X =X^0 X^0 =-N 2 (N 2 -1) ,   where 
X_i=^-1  x_i  X_i^0=-^-1  x_i^0 . The square of the Dirac operator, on the other hand, is calculated by using 
Eqs. (), (), (), (), and the definition 
() 
l^2 ^2 D^2=X X X^0 X^0  
-X X^0 (X X^0 -I+ (X +X^0 )).   This can be simplified further using () and ()
&&X X^0 =1 2 (L L -X X -X^0 X^0 )     

&& (X +X^0 )=J J -L L 
+3 4 I ,  the last equation is obtained noticing 

 with .
Finally, applying Eqs. () and (), the square of Dirac operator 
transforms to the form
l^2 ^2 D^2&=&X X X^0 X^0  
-1 2 (L L -X X -X^0 X^0 )


&&[1 2 (L L -X X -X^0 X^0 ) 
+J J -L L 
-1 4 I].   There are four classes of irreducible representations of the Lie algebra .
The first and the second classes include two principal discrete representations, which are realized in the Hilbert space through 
D ^ (j)= j,m_j :  j>0,  m_j=j,  (j+1),   (j+2), where
J ^2  j,m_j j,m_j ,   
J_3  j,m_j j,m_j . 
It is clear that the state  has the lowest weight  in the 
Hilbert space , while the state  has the highest
weight  in the Hilbert space . Also, there exist principal
continuos representations on the Hilbert space
C _ ()=,;m_  :  IR^+ ;   0<1;  m_ =+n , nZ 
where
J ^2 ,;m_  1 4 )
,;m_  ,   
J_3 ,;m_  =m_  ,;m_  .
Furtheremore, the Lie algebra  has complementary continuos representations, which are realized in the Hilbert space as 
&&C _ ()=,;m_  :  
-1 2 <<-,  0<1 2   


&& or   -1 2 <<,  1 2 <<1 ;
 m_ =+n ,  nZ 
where
J ^2 ,;m_  ,;m_  ,   
J_3 ,;m_  =m_  ,;m_  .
It is clear that the eigenvalues of the Casimir operator 
corresponding to the principal and complementary continuos representations
are the same if we choose  .
It is well known that the decomposition of the tensor product of positive
(or negative) discrete representations of the Lie algebra  is
D ^ (j)D ^ (s)_lj+s  D ^ (l). And, for  
the decomposition of the discrete representations become
&&D ^+ (s)D ^-(j)_0^  ^C _s-j+ () d j-s 1 2   and  
j+s1 2  

&&D ^+ (s)D ^-(j)_0^  ^C _s-j+ () dC _s-j+ ( j+s<1 2

Suppose the kets  span the two principal
discrete representation spaces of the operator , as given in
() as (). According to the decomposition () 
and (), and since ,
the allowed discrete representations of  with the
spectrum  is in 
. Note that  for both 
possitive and negative principal
discrete representations in (), and 
 for the negative principal
discrete representation in the last equation of (). 
If we denote the eigenvalues of  by , 
using Eqs. (),  
the spectrum of the squared Dirac operator is then calculated as
_j,m ^2=
(j+m-1 2 )^2[1
+1-(j+m-1 2 )^2 
N(N-2) ]+m(2j+m-1)
[4(j+m-1)^2-1 
2N(N-2) -1] ,   
where the operators   and  are restricted over their common
eigenstates. According to the above equation the spectrum of the Dirac operator on noncommutative  depends on both quantum numbers  and , whereas in the commutative 
case (hyperbolic plane) the spectrum depends  only on . It is interesting to
see whether the commutative spectrum can be reobtained from the above 
noncommutative expression. In the limit , observe that
 which depends
only on the quantum number , and this is consistent with the fact
that the spectrum of the Dirac operator on  is
degenerate. Hence, noncommutativity has lifted the degeneracy. Finally note that 
for a finite , the state  and  is a zeromode, and 
if we require the spectrum  to be real, we find
that .
