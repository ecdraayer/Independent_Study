We investigate classical dynamics of the bosonic string in the background metric,
antisymmetric and dilaton fields. We use canonical methods to find Hamiltonian in terms of
energy-momentum tensor components. The later are secondary constraints of the theory. Due to the
presence of the dilaton field the Virasoro generators have nonlinear realization. We find that, in
the curve space-time, opposite chirality currents do not commute. As a consequence of the
two-dimensional general covariance, the energy-momentum tensor components satisfy two Virasoro
algebras, even in the curve space-time.  We obtain new gauge symmetry which acts on both
world-sheet and space-time variables, and includes world-sheet Weyl transformation. We emphasize
that background antisymmetric and dilaton fields are the origin of space-time torsion and
space-time nonmetricity, respectively. 

Bosonic string, Hamiltonian, Virasoro algebra in curved space-time, Gauge symmetry 







Introduction 

The string propagation in the flat Minkowski space-time has been investigated for a long time and
it is well understood. The dynamics of string moving in arbitrary background metric,
which can be interpreted as the nonlinear -model, has also been studied
. The goal of these investigations was to analyze the consistency of string dynamics in the
presence of background fields. The condition for two-dimensional conformal invariance on the
quantum level, which technically means vanishing of the renormalization group -function for
nonlinear -model, produce the field equations for the background fields. The quantization
of the theory has been performed expanding the quantum fields  around the expectation value
, and using background field expansion by standard technique of Riemann normal
coordinates. This remarkable connection between the quantum feature of the world-sheet (conformal
invariance), and the classical space-time property of the string theory (equations of motion), has
been obtained perturbatively.

In this paper, we are going to investigate string propagation in the arbitrary
gravitational, antisymmetric tensor, and dilaton background fields. We will
make classical nonperturbative   investigation of the full
nonlinear  theory.

In Sec.2, we perform the canonical analysis, treating world-sheet fields as
variables in the theory, and space-time fields as a background depending on
the coordinates . We investigate the case 
, where 
is dilaton background field. Then the energy-momentum tensor components  appear as secondary
constraints. Let us stress that, in spite of the fact that some opposite chirality currents do not
commute and of the nonlinear realization of the Virasoro generators, they satisfy two Virasoro
algebras as a consequence of the world-sheet reparametrization invariance. Because of the presence
of the dilaton field, the conformal component of the world-sheet metric survives, and corresponding
new currents appear. The energy-momentum tensor is not in the Sugawara form, but is a more general
bilinear combination of the currents, plus linear term in  derivative of the currents.

We also derive the Hamiltonian equations of motion using the PB relations
between the energy-momentum tensor and the currents. With the help of
Lagrangian expressions for the currents we easy convert the above Hamiltonian
equations to the Lagrangian ones. Using these world-sheet equations of motion,
we introduce the space-time connection and covariant derivative in the
presence of the background fields.

In sec. 3, we investigate the case , (which is dilaton field
dependent condition) and define some space-time submanifold . The general
analysis is too complicated, so that we will consider the case where
intersection of the string world-sheet and submanifold  is a one
dimensional submanifold. Then, one primary constraint  appears. There is
only one secondary constraint , where  are
weakly equal to . It satisfies only one Virasoro algebra.

The role of the symmetry generated by the constraint  is resolved in
subsec. 3.2. This is a local gauge symmetry containing the transformations of
both world-sheet and space-time variables and includes two dimensional Weyl
transformation.

In the conclusion, we discus the contribution of the antisymmetric tensor and
the dilaton field to the space-time torsion and nonmetricity, respectively.

The Appendix A is devoted to the world-sheet geometry.

Bosonic string theory in the case 
 

In this section, we make complete canonical analysis of the bosonic string
theory when the condition on the dilaton field  
, is fulfilled in the whole space-time.
We obtain the nonlinear realization of the Virasoro algebra in the presence of
the background fields and derive the equations of motion.

Canonical analysis of the theory 

Let us consider bosonic string propagating in the non-trivial background,
described by the action-S= _d^2 -g   [ 1 2 g^ G_ (x)
+^  -g    B_ (x)]
_x^_x^+ (x) R^(2)     .   ac 
Here  are coordinates of two dimensional
world-sheet  and  are coordinates
of the  dimensional space-time . The background space-time fields:
metric , antisymmetric tensor field  and
dilaton field , depend on the coordinates . The intrinsic
world-sheet metric we denote by  and corresponding scalar
curvature by . Through the paper we will use the notation
 and

.

If we parameterize the world-sheet metric tensor  with the light-cone
variables   (for details see g  and  papers)
and introduce the useful combination of background fields
_ = B_  1 2  G_     ,
we can write the action in the form
S =  _d^2 -g  [ 2 _+   _+ x^ _- x^+ (R ^(2)  + 2   F ) ]    ,  acP 
or more explicitly
 
Here in agreement with  vec  we introduce light-cone
derivatives
.
We also use the following notation  and  for any variable .

The momenta corresponding to the fields  and  are
 
From the eq. () we can solve the time derivatives of the field  as
 = 1 4   (h^- i_-^- h^+ i_+^)    ,  fit 
where we introduced the currents
i_^_F 2  .   2.5 
We will denote the gradient of the dilaton field  by 
a_= _ , a^=G^  a_ , a^2=G^  a_a_  ,          ami 
and separately investigate two cases  and . The structure
of the theory basically depends on the above conditions. We will suppose that
the gradient of the dilaton field  is not light-cone vector, and the
condition  is fulfilled in the whole space-time. The case 
 we will consider in the next section.

Multiplying eq. () with  we can solve it in terms of 
F = 1 4   (h^- i_-^F - h^+ i_+^F)-1 2 
 (h^-+h^+)^       ,       Ft 
where we define new currents
i_^F= a^a^2  j_ -1 2 a^2  i_^2 F^     ,   2.8 
and
j_  =_+2_  x^ '   .      jmi 
We used the relation , which allow us to
trade  for . Substituting the
expression for  back into (), we can solve the same equation
in terms of  
x ^=  G^  2   (h^- J_-   - h^+ J_+  )   .  xt 
The corresponding currents  are defined as
J_  =P^T _ ^j_  +a_2
a^2 i_^= j_  - a_a^2  j   ,  J 
and we introduce the variable
j=a^j_  -1 2  i_^=a^2 (i_^F 2 F^)     .   j 
The projection operator
P^T _  = G_  - a_a_a^2    ,   PT 
will arise frequently in this article. Let us explain its geometrical
interpretation. Note that  is a normal vector to the  dimensional
submanifold , defined by the condition . For 
, the corresponding unit vector  is 
. Here  if  is time like vector
(), and  if  is space like vector (),
so that . Consequently, we can interpret the expression
P^T _  = G_ - n_n_G_ ^D-1    ,  im 
as a induced metric  on .

The time derivatives of the fields  and  we expressed in terms of the corresponding
currents fit ,Ft  and xt . The  derivative of the same fields we can express
in terms of the same currents
x^ = G^  2   (J_+   - J_-  )   , F^ = 1 4   (i_+^F - i_-^F)     ,  ^ = 1 4   (i_+^- i_-^)     .   prim 
Note that we introduce the momenta  and  for two
dimensional fields  and , respectively. We did not introduce
momentum for dilaton background field , but for convenience we have the
currents  in term of which we expressed the  and
. These variables are not independent, because of the relations
 and ,
which are equivalent to the following connection between the currents
. The last one can be confirmed directly from
J .

After long but straightforward calculation, the canonical Hamiltonian density
obtains the form
H _c= h^- T_- + h^+ T_+ + q^      ,  hc 
where the expressions for the energy momentum tensor components
T_=1 4  (G^  J_  J_  + i_^F i_^)
+1 2  i_^  =
1 4  ( G^ 
j_  j_  -j^2 a^2  ) +i_   ,  emt 
contains the useful combination of the currents
i_1 2  (i_^ ' - F' i_^ )   .  2.16 
In the expression for the canonical Hamiltonian  the term
q= -1 2  (h^- i_-^+ h^+ i_+^)    ,    2.17 
appears only on the world-sheet boundary  and does not contribute to the
equations of motion.

Virasoro algebra in the curved space-time 

We shall start with basic Poisson brackets (PB) algebra
 x^, _ = ^_  .  PB0 
Through the paper, we will understand that the first variable in PB depends on
 and the second one on . We will also use the
conventions , 
 and 
. On the right
hand side, all  dependence we will  write explicitly and
 dependence we will omit.

Let us first calculate PB between the currents , ,  and 
j_  , j_  = 2 (G_   ^ 
+ _,   x^  )   , j_  , j_  = 2 _,   x^ ^  ,    PB1 
j_  , i_^= 2 a_ ^    , j_  , i_^= 2 a_^   ,  PB2 
i_^, i_^ =0   ,  i_^,i_^ =0    ,     PB3 
 j ,j  =0    ,   j , i_^ = 2 a^2  ^   ,  j , i_=a^2 [^ +F^( )^ ]
+1 4 i_^( )^    ,   PB4 
 i_, i_ =-  1 2  [i_() + i_( ) ]
 ^   ,   i_, i_ = - 1 2  [i_() + i_( ) ] ^ 
^  (^   +F^   ^  +
 F^    )   ,      PB5 
 i_, i_^ =- 1 2  i_^ ^    ,  i_, i_^ =- 1 2  i_^ ^    .   PB6 
The expressions   are defined as
 ^_ = ^_  B^_       ,  coB 
where the first term is Christoffel connection
^_ =1 2  G^ (_G_ 
+ _G_ - _G_ )     ,        coG 
and the second one is the antisymmetric tensor field strength
B_ = _B_  + _B_  + _B_ =
D_B_  + D_B_  + D_B_      .       fsB 
The "generalized connection" is expressed in terms of the variables 
 in the similar way as Christoffel connection is
expressed in terms of 
_,  = 1 2  (_G_ 
+_G_ -_G_ )   .       coP 
For any momenta independent variables, , we have
 X , T_ =1 2   J^__X   . PB7 
Let us write the expression for the energy-momentum tensor components in the
form , where
t_1 4   G^  j_  j_  + i_ , t= 1 4    j^2 a^2     ,  t 
and let us introduce the combination
1 2 (  j^  - F^  j )   .  tau 
Then we obtain the following algebra
 t_, t_= -[ t_() +t_( ) ]  ^ 
- [ () +( ) ] ^    ,  vir 
 t_, t  + t , t_= -[ t() +t( ) ]  ^ 
[ () +( ) ]  ^   ,
t ,t  =0   ,
which produce the Virasoro algebra for the same chirality energy-momentum tensor components
 T_, T_= -[ T_() +T_( ) ]  ^     .   Vir 
Similarly, for the opposite chiralities we have
 t_, t_= [ () +( ) ] ^    , virpm 
 t_, t  - t , t_= [ () +( ) ]
 ^   ,
which contribute to the fact that the opposite chirality energy-momentum tensor
components commute
 T_, T_= 0      .    Virpm 
Consequently, the expression emt  presents new, non-linear 
realization of the Virasoro algebras. The dilaton
field  is the origin of the non-linearity. We want to stress, that the
opposite chirality currents generally do not commute in the curved space time,
see PB1 -PB6 , but the opposite chirality energy-momentum tensors
components commute.

The momenta , defined in (), are primary constraints. The total
Hamiltonian takes the form 
. The consistency conditions 
 produce the secondary constraints . As a consequence
of the Virasoro algebra Vir  and Virpm , the consistency conditions
for the secondary constraints  are satisfied and there are no more
constraints. All constraints are first class and they are generators of two
dimensional diffeomorphisms. The canonical Hamiltonian is weakly
equal to zero.

Equations of motion 

Using the expressions for the energy momentum tensor and for the currents
obtained in the previous subsections, we are going to find equations of motion
for the action ac . First we obtain Hamiltonian equations of motion and
then the corresponding Lagrangian ones. It is useful to define the expression
, where  is an arbitrary vector
function of the coordinates . Then with the help of hc  and
emt  we have
V _=  V_, H_c = - (h^V_)^+ h^- - h^+  2  
( ^D_  V_ ) J_^J_^ ,   dotV 
where we introduce notation
 

Under space-time general coordinate transformations the expression 
 transforms as a connection. It contains the
Christoffel connection coG , itself. If we consider 
 as a space-time connection, then 
 is corresponding covariant derivative. The consequences of such approach
we will explain in detail in the next paper.

We can rewrite dotV  in the world-sheet covariant way
 _V_= 1 2   
( ^D_  V_ ) J_^J_^ .  emV 
For , the last equation produce the equation of motion for the current 
 _J_^+ 1 2   
 ^_ ^J_^J_^=0    ,   emJ 
and for , the equation of motion for the current 
  _i_^=0    .    emifi 
From emV  and emJ  we also obtain
 _V_= 1 2    _V_J_^  .  isf 
Similarly, the equation of motion for the current 
has the form
 _i_^F  2 2  h^- -h^+  h^ 
 = 1 2  a^2  (D_  a_) J_^J_^ . emiF 
So, emJ , emifi  and emiF  are Hamiltonian equations of motion.
The equations for the momenta  produce the vanishing of the energy
momentum tensor components .

To obtain corresponding Lagrangian equations, it is possible to substitute the
expressions for the momenta into the Hamiltonian equations, but there is
equivalent and simpler approach. First we obtain the Lagrangian expressions
for the currents
J_ = 2  G_   _x^  ,  i_ ^2 2   _ , i_ ^F=  2  ( 2  _F  _ _)   ,
solving linear system of the equations, xt , fit , Ft  and
prim  and eliminating  and  derivatives of the corresponding
variables. Then, we substitute them into Hamiltonian equations and find
  x^-2  ^_ ^ _x^ _x^=0    ,           lemJ 
  =0        ,    lemfi 
  F + 1 2  R ^(2)  + 1 a^2  (D_  a_)
 _x^ _x^=0    ,     lemF 
T_=  2  (G_    _x^ _x^-2  _ _+4  _F  _-   )=0    .  lemh 
Note that equations lemJ  (with  and  indices) are equivalent, because of the property
, as well as
equations lemF  are equivalent, because of the property .

The Lagrangian expression for the equation isf  produce just the chain rule
 _V_=  _x^_V_     .
As a consequence of the relation , the
equation lemfi  follows from lemJ  and can be obtained just
multiplying the last one by .

Finally, we can go from the hat variables to the original ones (see App. A)
and obtain the final form of the Lagrangian field equations
__x^+  ^_ ^_x^_x^=0    ,    lJ 
G_   _x^_x^-2 __=0     ,  lh 
R^(2)  + 2 a^2  (D_  a_) _x^_x^=0
    .     lF 
The case  and new gauge symmetry 

In the previous section we considered the case . To complete the
investigation let us analyze the case .
This condition defines the space-time submanifold, which we denote by .
We also find new gauge symmetry, acting on both world-sheet and space-time
fields.

Canonical analysis 

With the help of () we can conclude that the current 
, already defined in j , for 
becomes primary constraint. To eliminate the time derivatives in terms of the
momenta it is useful to work with linear combinations of the fields 
and . So, we have
x ^+2 a^F  = G^  2   (h^- J^0_-   - h^+ J^0_+  )
-a^(h^- + h^+)^  ,
where we introduced the current
J^0_ = j_  2 a_F^   .
In analogy with prim , the same combination of the fields 
derivative can be expressed in the form
x^  + 2 a^F^= G^  2   ( J^0_+   - J^0_-  )   .
As a consequence of the condition , we have 
. It means that these currents are weakly
equal, on the constraint .

The canonical Hamiltonian has the same form hc , as in the  case.
The expressions for the energy momentum tensor components are slightly changed
T^0_= 1 4   G^  J^0_  J^0_  +1 2  i_^  =
1 4   G^  j_  j_  + i_  ,
and expressions for  and  are the same, as before.

To check the consistency conditions, it is useful to calculate the relevant
PB. Because  is exactly the same as  in t , we have the
same algebras vir  and virpm  with the same expression for 
tau . As in PB4 , the current  commute with itself and we also have
 j , t_ =-1 2 j( ) ^1 2   (D_  a_)
j_^j_^  .
The consistency condition for the constraint , calculated with , is
proportional to 
j =  j , H_T  (h^- - h^+) 1 2   (D_  a_)
j_^j_^  .           dotj 
Let us consider the case where the intersection of the world-sheet and
submanifold , is some one dimensional manifold. On this manifold we have
, which for finite  produces . Instead
of "naive" Hamiltonian 
 we should use the expression 
, because we have only one variable
 and consequently one momentum . In that case, the consistency
condition calculating with  vanishes.

The consistency condition for the constraint  produce the secondary
constraint  where .
Its consistency condition is satisfied because of the relation 
. There are no more constraints.

The PB algebra of the constraints
 T^0 , T^0 = -[ T^0() +T^0( ) ]  ^    ,  T^0 , j = j  ^ ,  j , j =0     ,
is semidirect product of the the Virasoro algebra with abelian algebra with
only one element . Both constraints,  and , are FCC. The
energy-momentum tensor  is the generator of the one dimensional
submanifold reparametrization.

The symmetry generated by the constraint  will be analyzed in the next
subsection.

New gauge symmetry which acts on both world-sheet and space-time fields 

Let us show, that besides well known space-time symmetries, general covariance
and abelian gauge symmetry for antisymmetric field  
, there exists a new
 gauge symmetry . It connects the transformations of the string coordinates and
world-sheet metric with the transformations of the background fields: space
time-metrics, antisymmetric and dilaton fields. The origin of this symmetry is
FCC .

Up to now, we understood that there exists a symmetry generated by constraint
, on some  and  dependent submanifold , defined by
the relation . If this symmetry can be extended on the whole
space-time, the transformations must include the background fields. Let as
assume, for a moment, that the background fields explicitly depend on .
We are not going to make space-time canonical analysis, because it is too
complicated, but it is very useful to calculate just the momentum
corresponding to the dilaton field 
_S    = j a^2     .
So, if we include the space-time fields, the primary constraint appears
j - a^2 _    .
It could be symmetry generator in the whole space-time, and not only on the
submanifold . We found out this constraint only for . In that
case the contribution of the momentum  disappears and it reduces to
the constraint .

This is indication that there exists some symmetry transformation in the whole
space-time, which acts on both the world-sheet variables ,  and
 and the space-time variables ,  and . The
transformation of the world-sheet variables, generated by the constraint ,
has general form
R() = R() , d   ( ) j( )    , dR 
where  is the transformation  parameter which depends on the world-sheet
coordinates . With the help of j  and dR  we obtain
x^= a^ , h^=0   , F=- 1 2    .  tws 
Corresponding transformation of the world-sheet metric
g_  = - g_     ,
we recognize as the two dimensional Weyl transformation.

After some calculations, we can check that the part of the
action ach  without field  and the part containing  are separately invariant under
transformations tws , if the background fields also transform as
_0 G_  =-2 D_a_  ,  _0 B_ =-a^B_    ,
_0 -a^2     .  ft 
The first two transformations we can rewrite in more compact form
_0 _  = D_  a_   . cft 
The expressions in ft  are the forms variations of the fields, defined as
a difference in the same space-time point , 
. The total transformations 
, include the terms
 and
obtain the form
 
The dilaton field  is invariant under the total transformation 
.

The action ac  is not invariant under Weyl transformation,
because of the term with dilaton field. Let us stress, that it is invariant
under more general transformations, which include the Weyl one, as well as the
transformations of the coordinates and of the background fields.

Conclusions and discussion 

In this paper, we investigated bosonic string theory in presence of
background fields. We used the Hamiltonian method and treated the space-time
coordinates  and the world-sheet metric  as variables
in the theory. We did the analysis for the arbitrary background fields as
functions of the string coordinates.

We obtained a new, nonlinear realization of the energy-momentum tensor
components emt . They satisfy two independent Virasoro algebras, which is
expected because the theory is invariant under world-sheet reparametrization.
These components are bilinear in the currents or linear in the 
derivative of the currents. All currents are linear in the momenta and in the
 derivative of the fields. Let us stress that the opposite chirality
components of the energy-momentum tensor commute, Virpm , in spite of the
fact that the corresponding currents do not commute. Using appropriate
commutation relations we obtain the Hamiltonian equations of motion which
easily produce the Lagrangian ones.

In the case , the current  becomes a primary constraint. If we
consider the background fields as space-time variables, then some generalized
constraint appears, which reduces to the previous one for . This is an
indication that the background fields should be included in the symmetry
transformations. We have found that there exist the local symmetry
transformations which contain both world-sheet variables tws  and
space-time variables ft .

The equations of motion lJ -lF  offer the possibility to investigate
the dynamics of the string, propagating in the curved target space. Starting
with the given stringy connection  cdc , let us here shortly discuss the
main features of the target space geometry. The space-time observed by the
string moving in the background ,  and , we
will call stringy space-time.

The antisymmetric part of the stringy connection is the stringy torsion 
 ^T_ ^_   ^_ ^_  -  ^_ ^_  =
2 P^T   _B^_            ,   T 
which is the transverse part of the field strength of the antisymmetric tensor
field .

We define the stringy parallel transport as usual
 ^_V^= -  ^_ ^V^d x^  .  ptcn 
The metric postulate is defined by the demand, that after parallel transport
the metric is equal to the local one. The most interesting feature of the
stringy geometry is the breaking of the space-time metric postulate. The stringy nonmetricity 
 ^Q_  - ^D_  G_  =
1 a^2  D_  (a_a_)          ,   mp 
is different from zero, which means that metric  is not compatible with stringy connection
.
Consequently, during parallel transport the length and angle deformations depend on the vector field .

So, with the help of the equations of motion, we recognize the expressions
 as stringy connections. It helps us to
conclude that the string can feel the space-time torsion and nonmetricity. The
more detailed investigation of the stringy geometry and geometrical
interpretation of the equations of motion will be presented in.



World-sheet geometry in the light-cone basis 

In this appendix we present our notations and conventions concerning
intrinsic world sheet geometry in the light-cone basis.

We parameterize the world-sheet metric  with light-cone
variables   g_  =e^2F  g _ =
1 2 e^2F  -2h^-h^+    &  h^-+h^+            h^-+h^+    &  -2        .               g 
The interval of the world-sheet 
ds^2 = g_  d ^d ^= 2 d ^+ d ^-     ,
can be expressed in terms of the light-cone coordinates
d ^=  1 2   e^F ( d ^1 - h^d ^0) = e^F d  ^= e^ _d ^    .
The quantities  define the light-cone one form basis
, and its inverse define the tangent
vector basis . In this
basis, components of the arbitrary vector  are
V_ =e^-F  V _=e_  ^V_=
2  e^-F  h^- -h^+  (V_0+h^ V_1)  .     vec 
The world-sheet covariant derivatives on tensor  are
_X_n = (_  +n _ ) X_n     ,        4.6 
where the number  is sum of the indices, counting index  with  and
index  with , and
_  =e^-F ( _ _F)   ,  _=2 h^- -h^+  h^    ,
are two dimensional Riemannian connections. In this notations the world-sheet
scalar curvature has the form
R^(2)  =2 _- _+ -2 _+ _-         .          R2 
We also use the relation
-g  R^(2)  =-g  (R ^(2)  +2  F)    ,        RR 
where
 =-2  _ _  ,  L 
is the Laplace operator.
