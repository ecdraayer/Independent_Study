In order to evaluate the Feynman path integral in
noncommutative quantum mechanics, we consider properties of a
Lagrangian  related to a quadratic Hamiltonian with noncommutative
spatial coordinates. A quantum-mechanical system with
noncommutative coordinates is equivalent to another one with
commutative coordinates. We found connection between quadratic
classical Lagrangians of these two systems. We also shown that
there is a subclass  of quadratic Lagrangians, which includes
harmonic oscillator  and particle in a constant field, whose
connection between ordinary and noncommutative regimes can be
expressed as a linear change of position in terms of a new
position and velocity.

Introduction 

Quantum theories with noncommuting spatial coordinates have been
investigated intensively during the recent years. M(atrix) theory
compactification on noncommutative tori, strings in some constant
 backgrounds, quantum Hall effect and IR/UV mixing are some of
the most popular themes (for a review of noncommutative quantum
field theory and some related topics, see e.g.). Most of
the research has been done in noncommutative field theory,
including noncommutative extension  of the Standard Model
. Since quantum mechanics can be regarded as the
one-particle nonrelativistic sector of quantum field theory, it is
also important to study its noncommutative aspects including
connection between ordinary and noncommutative regimes. Because of
possible phenomenological realization, noncommutative quantum
mechanics (NCQM) of a charged particle in the presence of a
constant magnetic field has been mainly considered on two- and
three-dimensional spaces (see, e.g. and references
therein). 

Recall that to describe quantum-mechanical system
theoretically one uses a Hilbert space  in which
observables are linear self-adjoint operators. In ordinary quantum
mechanics (OQM), by quantization, classical canonical variables
 become Hermitean operators 
satisfying the Heinsenberg commutation relations [
x_k ,p_j ] = i _kj , [x_k ,x_j ] = 0,[p_k ,p_j ] =0,  
k,j=1,2n .  In a very general NCQM  one has that  
, but 
 and 
 However, we consider here the most simple and usual NCQM which
is based on the following algebra: [ x_k ,p_j ] =
i _kj , [x_k ,x_j ] = i
_kj ,[p_k ,p_j ] =0 ,  where  is the antisymmetric matrix with
constant elements. 

To find  as elements  of the Hilbert space in
OQM, and their time evolution, it is usually used the
Schrodinger equation

 which realizes the eigenvalue problem for the
corresponding Hamiltonian operator ,
where  and
. However, there is another approach based
on the Feynman path integral method K (x",t";x',t') =_(x',t') ^(x",t")  (
i   S[q]) D q ,  where
 is the kernel of the unitary evolution
operator , functional 
 is the action for a path  in the classical
Lagrangian , and  with the
following notation  and
. The kernel  is
also known as quantum-mechanical propagator,  Green's function,
and the probability amplitude for a quantum particle to come from
position  at time   to another point  at . The
integral in () has a symbolic meaning of an intuitive idea
that a quantum-mechanical particle may propagate from  to
 using infinitely many paths which connect these two points
and that one has to take all of them into account. Thus the
Feynman path integral means a continual (functional) summation of
single transition amplitudes 
 over all possible paths  connecting
 and . In direct calculations, it is the
limit of an ordinary multiple integral over  variables 
 when . Namely, the time interval  is
divided into  equal subintervals and integration is performed
for every  and fixed time . In
fact, , as the kernel of the unitary
evolution operator, can be defined by equation (x",t") = K (x",t";x',t') (x't') dx'
 and then Feynman's path integral is a method to
calculate this propagator. Eigenfunctions of the integral equation
() and of the above Schrodinger equation are the same.
Note that the Feynman path integral approach, not only to quantum
mechanics but also to whole quantum theory, is intuitively more
attractive and more transparent in its connection with classical
theory  than  the usual canonical operator formalism. In gauge
theories and some other cases, it is  also the most suitable
method of quantization. 

The Feynman path integral for quadratic Lagrangians  can be
evaluated analytically and the exact result for the propagator is
K (x",t";x',t') =1 (i h)^n 2   
(-^2 S  x"_k
x'_j  )   (2i h S (x",t";x',t')),  where 
 is the action for the classical trajectory
which is solution of the Euler-Lagrange equation of
motion.



In this article we search the form of a  Lagrangian which
corresponds to a system with noncommutative spatial coordinates.
This is necessary to know before to employ Feynman's path integral
method in NCQM. To this end, let us note that algebra () of
operators  can be replaced by the equivalent one [
q_k ,p_j ] = i _kj , [q_k ,q_j ] = 0,[p_k ,p_j ] =0 ,
 where linear transformation  x_k  =
q_k  - _kj p_j  2   is used,
while  are remained unchanged, and summation over
repeated indices is assumed. According to (), NCQM related
to  the classical phase space  can be regarded as an OQM on
the other phase space . Thus, in -representation,
 in  the
equations () and (). It is worth noting that
Hamiltonians  

,
which are more than quadratic in , will induce Schrodinger
equations which contain derivatives higher than second order and
even of the infinite order. This leads to a new part of a modern
mathematical physics of partial differential equations with
arbitrary higher-order derivatives (for the case of an infinite
order, see, e.g. and). In this paper we restrict
our consideration to the case of quadratic Langrangians (
Hamiltonians).

Quadratic Lagrangians 
Classical case 
Let us start with a classical system described by a quadratic
Lagrangian which the most general form in three dimensions is:
 L(x , x,t) &=& _11 x _1^2 +_12 x_1  x_2  +_13 x_1  x_3  +_22 x _2^2 +_23 x_2  x_3 
  2mm  
 & + & _33  x _3^2 + _11 x _1  x_1  +_12  x_1  x_2 +_13 x_1  x_3 + _21 x_2  x_1  2mm 

& + &  _22 x_2  x_2 +_23 x_2 
x_3 + _31 x_3 x_1  +_32  x_3
 x_2 + _33  x_3  x_32mm 

 & + & _11  x_1^2 
+_12  x_1  x_2 +_13  x_1  x_3 +_22   x_2 ^2  + _23  x_2  x_3  + _33 
x_3^2  2mm  

& + & _1  x_1  +_2  x_2 + _3 
x_3 + _1  x_1 +_2 x_2 +_3 x_3 + ,
where the coefficients 

   and 
 are some analytic functions of  the time  .


If we introduce the following matrices, 5mm 






















 

assuming that the matrix  is nonsingular (regular)  and
if we introduce vectors   =(_1 ,_2
,_3 ),   = (_1 , _2 , _3 ), x = (x_1, x_2, x_3), x = (x_1 ,x
_2,x_3),one can express the Lagrangian () in the
following, more compact, form:  L(x ,x,t)
=   x  , x   + 
  x  , x    +   x , x   +    , x  
+    , x   + ,
where  denotes standard
scalar product. Solving the equations
 
one can express  as
 
Then, the corresponding classical  Hamiltonian H(p,x,t)= p , x   - L(x ,x,t)becomes also quadratic, i.e.,  H(p,x,t) =
A  p , p  +  B  x , p   + C  x  , x  +  D   , p 
+   E   , x  + F ,
where:   & & A   =14    ^-1 ,    B  
=-12    ^-1   , 2mm 

& & C  =14   ^   ^-1    -
  , 
  D  =- 12   ^-1   ,2mm  

& & E   = 12   ^   ^-1 
   -   ,  F  = 14 
   ,  ^-1    -  
. Here,   denotes transpose map of
.

















Let us mention now that matrices  and  are symmetric
( and ), since the matrices  and
 are symmetric. Also, if the Lagrangian  is
nonsingular (), then the Hamiltonian 
is also nonsingular (). 

The above calculations can be considered as a map from the
space of quadratic nonsingular Lagrangians  to the
corresponding space of quadratic nonsingular Hamiltonians 
 More precisely, we have 
 given by (L( , , , ,  , ,x ,x))
& = & H (_1(L),_2(L),
_3(L),_4(L),

 & &  _5(L),_6(L),_7(L),_8(L))

 & = & H(A ,B ,C ,D ,E ,F ,p ,x ).From relation () it is clear that inverse of  is
given by the same relations (). This fact implies that
 is essentially involution, i.e. 








































Noncommutative case 
In the case of noncommutative coordinates 
, one can replace these
coordinates using the following ansatz (), ncc 
x  = q   - 12   p  ,








where 

 and    = (
  ) . Now, one can easily check that  for  are
mutually commutative operators (but do not commute with operators
of momenta,  
). 

If we start with quantization of the nonsingular quadratic
Hamiltonian given by (), i.e., 
 and then apply
the change of coordinates (), we will again obtain
quadratic quantum Hamiltonian, 

















 
where













































































& & A _  = (A  - 12     B 
-14    C    )_sym ,     
B _  = B  -   C  , 2mm 

& & C _  = C ,     D _  = D  + 12    E ,    E _  = E     
F _  = F  , and   denotes
symmetrization of the corresponding operator. Let us note that for
the nonsingular Hamiltonian  and for  sufficiently small
 the Hamiltonian  is also
nonsingular.


















































2mm 

In the process of calculating path integrals, we need
classical Lagrangians. It is clear that to an arbitrary quadratic
quantum  Hamiltonian we can  associate classical one  replacing
operators by the corresponding classical variables. Then, by using
equations 

 from such Hamiltonian we can come back to the
corresponding Lagrangian 

 where

is replaced in . In fact, our idea is to find
connection between Lagrangians of  noncommutative and the
corresponding commutative quantum mechanical systems (with 
). This implies to find the composition of the following
three maps: L_ =()(L), where
 and
 (here we use facts that  is an
involution given by formulas (), and  is given by
()). More precisely, if & & L(x ,x,t)
=   x , x  +

  +    , x   + 
  , x  + ,and & & L_ 
(q ,q,t) =  _  q , q 
+   _  q , q  +  _  q , q   + 
 _  , q   +   _ 
, q   +  _  ,then the connections
are given by & &   _ = (
 ^-1  - 12  ( ^   ^-1 
  ^-1   ) +    - 14   ^   ^-1   
)^-1 , 2mm  

 & &    _ =  _  (  ^-1 
   + 12    ^   ^-1 
  - 2    ), 2mm  

& &   _ =14
( ^   ^-1 -12  ^

& & 5mm  - 2   ) -14  ^   ^-1    + , e1 2mm  

& & 
 _ = _ ( ^-1  -12 ^

& &    _  = 12

It is clear that formulas () are very complicated and
that to find explicit  exact relations between elements of
matrices in general case is a very hard task. However, the
relations () are quite useful in all particular cases.

Linearization and  some examples 

 In this section we  try to introduce
 the linear change of coordinates to gain  directly from
  for some simple examples.
 Let  be a nonsingular quadratic Lagrangian given by ().
 If we make the following change of variables:
  2mm  x =q , x =U()q  +V()q 
+W()=Uq  +Vq  +W, e2 we  obtain again quadratic Lagrangian
 where & &  _ = (   + U^    U +  
U)_sym , 
 _ =2 U^    V +   V, 3mm  

 & &   _ =  W + 2
U^    W +   + U^   ,
  _ = V^ 
   V,3mm  

& &  _  = 2 V^    W
+ V^  ,   _  = 
 W+  , W +   , and 
are matrices.

It is clear that formulas () are  simpler then
(). We will see that for some systems, by this linear
change of the coordinates, it is possible to obtain  connection
between Lagrangians  and 



































Example 1.  Harmonic oscillator ,  In this
case we have & &   =m2 Id , =0, =kId ,=
 J,  where  is related to an ordinary
harmonic oscillator, & &  J=( rc  0 & 1

-1 & 0),  J^2=- Id , =0,
 =(_1^ ,_2^ ), =0 , and  is  unit matrix.

Using formulas (), one can easily find  _ =m 2-km^2  Id ,   _ =-2k m 2-km^2 
 J, _ =2 k 2-km^2 
Id .2mm From () it follows &
&  _ = +U^  U =  +k
U^ U,and consequently 
3mm 

 & &  _ -  =km^2
 ^2 2(2-km^2) Id  .
So, it is clear that matrix  is proportional to
an orthogonal operator, i.e,  Now, from
() we obtain e7  l m 2   1 2-km^2  ,
where  and
  Similarly, from () and
 we find that matrix
 is also proportional to an orthogonal operator 
 where e8  = _ 
2  2-km^2  ,
 and   It is known that   lll

V =R()=( cr  & -

V =R_1()=( rc

& ) , where   From ()
and (), we find & &  _ =2
U^     V =
-2km 2-km^2  J, and using  ()-(), we have U ^  V =- _l_  J.
 From (), depending on
 (-1 or 1), we have e11 
 2  or  2 .If   from the
relation  we obtain that  It
implies that in this case the transition from Lagrangian
 to the Lagrangian  is
given by a linear change of the coordinates. 3mm 

Finally, let us show that in the case  it is
not  possible to obtain the transition from Lagrangian
 to the Lagrangian   by a
linear change of the coordinates (). From () and
(),

we have & &
 _ =2U^   W+U^  







and consequently & & W=1 2k U 
 _  - 1 2k  .e12  Similarly, from the relation



one can find





& & W=1 2k V   _  -
1 2k  .e12a  The relations ()
and () imply e13 
 _ =l U ^ V  _ 
= -l   J  _ ,From the
other side, the relations () and () give  _ =m 2-km^2  J
 , e14   _ =21-km^2 2-km^2 
 .Combining the relations ()  and
(), we have& & 
1 2-km^2  =-
1-km^2 2-km^2, and
consequently  but it is impossible,
since  , according to () and
(). 5mm 

In the first case (), the corresponding Lagrangian
 is e15  & & 
L_  =  _ q , q +
 _  q , q + _  q , q +
 _ ,q + _ , q +
 _ 2mm  

& & -5mm  = 1 2-km^2   [ m(
q _1 ^2 +q _2 ^2)+ 2k (q_1 ^2 +q_2 ^2)-
2km( q _1q_2 - q_1q _2 )] . From (), we obtain the  Euler-Lagrange equations,
e15b  m q _1-2 mkq _2 -
2kq_1 =0 and  m q _2 +2
mkq _1 - 2kq_2 =0. Let us remark that
the Euler-Lagrange equations () form a coupled system of
second order differential equations, which is more complicated
than in commutative case (). 5mm 

Example 2.  A particle in a constant field ,


This example is defined by the following data: &
&  =m2 Id , =0, =0,   =0,  =(_1^ ,_2^ ), =0. 

Using the general composition formula (), one can
easily find e17  & &   _ =m 2  Id , 
  _ =0,     _ =0,  
  _ = , 3mm  

& &   _ =  m 2 
J    and   F_ =m^2 8  , ,where  is the same as in the first example (see ()).

Now, using the method of the linear change of  coordinates,
from the relation (), we have & & 
 _ =m2  Id , 
 _ =0,   _ =0,
   _ =V^   , 3mm 

 & &   _  =
  U^ ,   and    _ =
  ,W .
From () and (), it is
easy to see that for e17b 
U=-m 2 J,V=Id and W=m^2 8  ,the
linearization gives the same as the general formula. 5mm 

In this case, it is easy to find the classical action. The
Lagrangian  is e17c  L_  &
= &







m 2    ( q _1 ^2 +q _2 ^2 - (_1
q _2 - _2 q _1 )) + _1 q_1  

&  & +  _2 q_2
+m^2 8 (_1 ^2+_2 ^2). The
Lagrangian given by () implies the  Euler-Lagrange
equations, e17d  m q _1 =_1 and 
m q _2 =_2. 2mm  Their solutions are:
e17d  q_1(t)=
_1t^2 2m +tC_2+C_1and q_2(t)=
_2t^2 2m +tD_2+D_1,where  and
 are constants which have to be determined from  conditions:
 e18  q_1(0)=x_1',q_1(T)=x_1" q_2(0)=x_2',q_2(T)=x_2".After finding the
corresponding constants, we  have




& & q_j(t)= x_j'+ _jt^2 2m +
t(1 T (x_j"-x_j') - _j
T 2m ),j=1,2,
 e20   

 e20a  & & q _j(t)=
_jt m + 1 T (x_j"-x_j') - _j
T 2m ,j=1,2.
 
























Using () and (),  we finally calculate the
corresponding action & & S _(x",T;x',0)=_0 ^T  L_ (q ,q,t) dt =
m 2T   [(x_1"-x_1')^2+(x_2"-x_2')^2]  3mm

x_1')+_2(x_2"+x_2')] - m 2

(_1 ^2+_2 ^2). Concluding Remarks 


Note that almost all results obtained in Section  for
three-dimensional case allow straightforward generalization to any
 spatial dimension. 

According to the formula (), the propagator in NCQM
with quadratic Lagrangians can be easily written down  when we
have the corresponding classical action 

where  is solution of the Euler-Lagrange equations of
motion. As a simple example we calculated 
 for a noncommutative regime of a particle on plane
in a constant field. 

Note that the path integral approach to NCQM has been
considered in the context of the Aharonov-Bohm effect,
Aharonov-Bohm and Casimir effects, and a quantum system
in a rotating frame. Our approach includes all systems
with quadratic Lagrangians (Hamiltonians) and some new results on
path integrals on noncommutative spaces will be presented
elsewhere.
